the plot for descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. one near the beginning - one at the end. together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. everything (and i mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. i like disturbing movies, i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming. rosario dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. and no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the nc-17 version, which i saw.if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch "descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.

i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments. it's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre. plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief. i'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/tv/literature/life behind you (to be honest, i've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even). otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. and that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point. it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay off.

when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is! edison started really good with some good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but... (in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience,done, a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action ,done, and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie...) when you see 30 elite police officers (packed with weapons that can demolish a building) shoot at a guy behind a car, fail to hit him even once while he kills all (but 3) and then the guy takes out a flame thrower (to kill the rest 3) ,you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this!

ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names. i mean great actors like, the freeman aka morgan freeman, an asset to hollywood, however completely wasted in this film. then we got kevin spacey, who i've been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects. both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story. then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake. i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him yet. well the reason for that , i might add, is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review. the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it. the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone. they got the one liners and sound-bite worthy stuff. the token troubled black guy (ll cool j) who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life. the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone. and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience. oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot. spoiler(not!!!) the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero prevails. they got flame throwers and rocket launchers, really no kidding.bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of justin timberlake, to all the 13 year old girls out there, enjoy!! i wish i had more hands, because then i would have more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening.may g*d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies. well it could be worst, another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher, hehe check out in the mix lol, or even get rich or die trying'. now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30+ year old men, playing 16 or even younger teens. i could go on with these.

i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film. i managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead (which, by the way, is great fun).the story has massive holes in it. the plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at (looking daft and singing like a castrato). morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet. freeman and timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something, which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that; though freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion.don't watch this film, it is a pure waste of time.

the plot of 'edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire f.r.a.t. squad. whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, justin timberlake managed to ruin it. do not waste your time watching this film. don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice.and justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing.

*** review may contain some spoilers *** i'll make this review short and sweet. i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman. how bad could it be, right? well, it's pretty bad. justin timberlake plays pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison's police force. ll cool j is deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called f.r.a.t. (first response assault tactics). he's teamed with an "on-the-edge" bad cop named lazerov (dylan mcdermott). in the opening scene we see lazerov & deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs. i don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs. pollack, who works for ashford (morgan freeman) goes to a trial involving deeds & lazerov. he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly. wallace (kevin spacey) who is all within the f.r.a.t. team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey's performance are pretty lackluster. the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott. he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me. ll cool j is terrible in this film. he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. he was much better in movies like deep blue sea & any given sunday. the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film. the ending is far from satisfying.don't waste your time with this film. i'm putting it on ebay this weekend.

i stopped by bb and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. now, i understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspect. so i'm not expecting much. but it should at least have a story. stories don't cost a thing except time.....apparently, they didn't have any time either."zombie nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers. the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie. it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.the running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours. according to my wife (who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like zombie porn....which if you think about, sounds kinda gross.....but it wasn't even that good.the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off. i rated it a 1 out of 10 because imdb won't allow me to use decimals.

not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts.*makeup that a child can do. *acting was over done...poor directing. *editing was very choppy...many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous. *sound was badly dubbed. *music was highly inappropriate. *casting was extremely off...must have been on crack. *zombies that talk let alone...drive, dance, work...just pisses me off. *and the bad guy...holy crap! as horribly casted as he was...he was the best looking zombie of all. which doesn't say much.the cover art was good but very deceiving...as was the main menu of the dvd...great artwork and music.don"t bother!

thank god! i didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it! this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life, f*****g visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others. there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie. ok if you get time after reading this comment, please check out the director's(ulli lommel) profile. after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this, i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him, but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence. even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie.

i rented this movie last week. i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. and it was, until justin timberlake came on scene. he is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. i mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors i've ever seen. he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack? i think matt damon would have been a better choice.kevin spacey was another big disappointment. his character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en. it might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.now, dylan mcdermott's acting is very good. it's about one of the very few good things about this movie. he is just inspired.morgan freeman is good but nothing special. he has some really cool lines though.about the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. i was expecting a big twist when lazerov (dylan mcdermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.

usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant...i tend to support everybody, because their efforts are worth...but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits!imagine the following situation:1. think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far.2. think about some great, attractive art for that movie's dvd box...and a promising plot...3. voilà! you got zombie nation.see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do. anything is better.

notice i have given this 1 star if the option been given i would have given this zero. as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest. i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake. but it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen.the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best. do not let that fool you. this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world.the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it. the acting (if you can call it that), the "plot" (so many holes must look like swiss cheese), and the special effects really are just terrible.please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch.in the end i'm not saying i can make a better movie than this, but i am thinking it.

ll cool j. morgan freeman. dylan mcdermott. kevin spacey. john heard. cary elwes. roslyn sanchez. justin timberlake -- wait a minute. justin timberlake? and he's the star? i should have known better than to rent edison force. in fact, i did know better. but in a moment of absolute weakness, i rented this stv. when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. as in sat-on-a-shelf. which this did. and with good reason. the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force, and "journalist" timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them. he is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe i should say for his horrible acting. i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. just awful. the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a hobo. you just know the director was not in control. freeman is clearly slumming.

how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up? with enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop.you will never get your 90ish minutes back. life is too precious to rent this movie.i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.if you like justin timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. he does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him. however, i believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this movie.

if you watched this movie you know why i said "jesus, jesus, jesus". hehehe!!! every time they said "jesus, jesus, jesus"... i laughed thinking "jesus, jesus, jesus, why did i rent this movie"? i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen. wtf is timberlake? dreaful acting! i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job! this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him... but i really prefer an actor, not this android called timberlake. and his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. i was happy when they both were popped in the street.the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well. the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all. it would have been much enjoyable without him.by the way, the music was ok, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. something misplaced for this cops movie i thought. maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake.

timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen. it wasn't all bad, i just think the reporters role was wrong for him.ll cool j played the typical rapper role, toughest,baddest guy around. i don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend.morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie. he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie.kevin spacey wasn't good or bad he was just "there".overall it's a dull movie. bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.

pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-tv movie. i can't believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick. for some reason morgan freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying "pussy" when referring to nsync boy's girlfriend. morgan freeman calling women "pussy" is just awkward... what the hell were the people behind this film thinking? too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.i rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked.

the movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one. i have to admit i had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed. the voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off of legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them. said to say, i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only. too bad i was wrong. these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason i give this a 4. i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast... and cannot believe it.

oh dear god. this was horrible. there is bad, then there was this. this movie makes no sense at all. it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all. the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman. the fact that 'edison' isn't a real city, takes away. since i live in vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. why didn't they make it a real city? the only writing that was decent was'tilman' in which john heard did a fantastic job. he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. too bad. hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give john heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the a list.

there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video: it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud. the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring. just a notch above lowbrow (thanks to freeman and spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as justin timberlake's acting. i hate to knock the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better.the movie isn't all bad...just mostly. i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man. he deserves it. and, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well (you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery), and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars (out of ten...he's not that good).when all is said and done, the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake. it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters. all in all, t's just plain boring. that being said, rent this when you are suffering from insomnia.

this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise. i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland. (yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good, and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league, but still be consistent.) anyway i loved the first major league, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the indians would finally go all the way to the series. you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. what happened? anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk.

this movie is so bad it's funny. it stars scott backula as some coach, but that's not important, what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base. first off he has to be at least 75 years old, yet still plays minor league baseball, second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk, let alone run. coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film, (spoiler), he tells his star player "downtown" to hit a home run, clearly "downtown" viewed this as a good move. he hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie. now if only tony muser, manager of the royals, would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat, the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game.

okay, just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie. well, at least i did. it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour. *spoiler*it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants. the only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way. she always wins the competitions, therefore pushing the mother further towards "eliminating" her. after talking to a "hitman", the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit. so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught.the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening. don't waste your time watching this.

this is one very dire production. the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. here was the production's weakest point, the actress failed to get that across. it also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a hairdresser - from the outset, the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush. the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical.the production was a flaw ridden, cliché ridden, embarrassing load of rubbish. i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas!

for months i've been hearing about this little movie and now i've seen it. i find it cute, cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie. troops, swingblade, any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind. if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films. how many times have you heard the phrase, "it's animal house meets back to the future"; "it's wall street meets dead poet's society"; or "shakespeare in love meets star wars"? i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable.

way back in 1967, a certain director had no idea about a galaxy, far away or near. he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc. this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george. i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it. this is merely an advertising promo for the director, actors, et. al. it has little intrinsic artistic value. it is a brochure. the lead playing george, is very fine, as is the leia character, and the ersatz darth character. all else is plain commercial dross. what a waste. still, it got the job done i guess. the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess. a brochure only.

where's michael caine when you need him? i've seen most of the many seasons of mst3k, but this rare pre-1st season flick (episdoe k-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. three "stars", lee majors, chris makepeace and burgess meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheney-style workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on super 8. makes logan's run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare. i can't imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since it's unwatchable even with it. clearly what's needed in hollywood is some sort of 401k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. with its "rights to pollute and drive" theme, by the end, i'm half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his "cold dead hands" speech. lee, i could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?

stupid, mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (piloted by burgess meredith) chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades-old gasoline sludge, driven by lee majors, with chris makepeace as the runaway techno-wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously, and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society. as moronic as it sounds. terrible waste of burgess meredith, but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film.

this juvenile, bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens' bodies, desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. how ? by burning up gas and equating a fast, reckless car (or plane) with freedom.the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers' neighborhood (if it were run my an oil conglomerate) and logan's run (if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style).starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world in which an all-powerful government doesn't want you to (*ahem*) drive your car and burn gas. sort of the opposite of today's enron-and-bush, oil-grabbing, suv-pushing government.this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable. but wait...there's more. although the film is set in the future, we're not shown any signs of future technology, beyond a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. you will believe that the future looks... exactly like today. same clothing, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made. there are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternate energy.the acting is flat and flavorless. even scenes which could have been gritty or moving, buddy-flick, honor, romance, horror... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase.continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by burgess meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode.even die-hard car-film and sf fans should avoid this film like month-old roadkill, unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank.

i saw this movie years ago, and i was impressed... but then again i was only 12 years old. i recently re-watched it and want that time back. this film is pretty bad. while i like lee majors, chris makepeace (watch my bodyguard (1980)if you would like to see a good movie that he was in... of meatballs (also starring bill murray) for some laughs), and burgess meredith, this role does/did nothing for their careers.anyway, lee majors character, franklyn hart, is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car (which he had in storage) across the country to california. one problem: the government has outlawed all private transportation. i thought the concept was ok (not the worse i've heard of), but the execution failed horribly.

honestly before i watched this movie, i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace. i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie, and watched it by my own. apparently they were right. i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did i watch this movie.of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business. but morgan and kevin? i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison. to be honest, their roles are rather stupid.well you might think if the players suck, then i should pay more attention to the story. it is indeed story is the core of a movie, but guys... trust me... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story. imagine this, a smart-ass journalist (justin timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss (morgan freeman). this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice (ll cool j) and an brilliant investigator (kevin spacey). at the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story.jeez, i could not even carry on with this. just recalling the movie is making me sick already. my advise guys, don't watch this! please save your money and time for another movie.

after watching this on the mst3k episode, i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from. it seems to combine elements of logans run, farenheight 451, final sacrifice and at least several others. at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower. i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that, even though gas is unavailable, there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f1 race car going all the way across the country.

this 30 minute documentary buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. first, let's admit that 70 years later, spain is much richer than it was then (and when i say this, i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored, but with western european style capitalism. but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of pi. teaching math to poor people, the horror!. buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. what is he proposing? that children are taught exactly what at school? doesn't buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?

the writer/director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film. i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey, because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun. the story was awful, the characters were very one dimensional. for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director). no poker fan in this world likes this movie. even your money man hates this project. to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker. keep your day job. and if it's playing poker, then you must be hurt'n.

people, please don't bother to watch this movie! this movie is bad! it's totally waste of time. i don't see any point here. it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again.

lets enter the world of this movie for a second, so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here.edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50,000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars, shouting at them, and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him......instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief....instead of just walking up and pop!.....what do you do? the bad guy.....he talks to him. he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun. they have nothing to talk about! shoot him! shoot him now! but he talks to him anyway. oh another thing. at the end, a newspaper says "pulitzer prize winner story right here" or something right above on a front page of a paper, when its like the first time the story is printed. so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast? yea, you know those types of stupid movies? yea well that's edison in a nutshell.you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely, ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie,while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places,and who's last line "duck" was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made... and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks, little cocky bastard.the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best "denzel from training day" impression, which was pretty entertaining.oh yea so whats the movie about? eh, something about scandals involving the city edison's fictional special unit police force called "f.r.a.t. (i swear i'm not making this stuff up) which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s.w.a.t. anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from frat, and he goes scurrying off looking for a story, gaining his boss' (freeman) trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought. blah blah blah. its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day.the pacing was slow and off, the script was horrible, and the acting was extremely uninspired. it jumped everywhere without going anywhere. people get put in comas and you forget about them. everyone in this movie just didn't think. damn what a stupid movie. its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended...no lie basically, do not waste your time!

an updated version of a theme which has been done before. while that in and of itself is not bad, this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other "inherent and pure" evil ones do. predictable, ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark. not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending.

this is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. the result is like every single episode of "columbo" or "murder she wrote". the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock! this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. skip this one, you are not missing anything.

murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-for-tv but isn't. considering the only actor of any note is bullock (although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things), it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things. like... remembering to lock your front door when you go out. or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower.bullock plays cassie mayweather, a cop with personal issues (don't they all). together with her new partner (a wet-looking ben chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder. as the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood (ryan gosling).the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless. bullock, though she is very nice to look at, is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield (actually, he'd be better!). chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood. at least gosling and pitt, as the conniving sneering suspects, acquit themselves adequately. as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough, a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run."murder by numbers" has absolutely nothing going for it, even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn't redeem it. well, just a little but still not enough to save it. forgettable, predictable and redundant - this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward. as cassie probably says on her next case, there's nothing to see here people. move along, keep moving...

well, the writing was very sloppy, the directing was sloppier, and the editing made it worse (at least i hope it was the editing). the acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. pretty much none of the characters were likable. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. it was a great idea, but yet another wasted good idea goes by. it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending. and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the ending was not worth watching at all. sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the movie looked rushed also. the movie just wasn't really worth seeing, and had i paid for it i would have been very mad. maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one. the movie over all was not horrifibly bad, but i wouldn't reccomend it. i gave it 2 out of 10 b/c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character (justin i believe, the super smart one). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not pretty. anyway, if you see it, wait for the $1.50 theater or video, unless you like pretty much every movie you see, then i guess you'll like this one.

at first the movie seemed to be doing great, they had the characters profiles set...the plot seemed to be going in the right direction... however, as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things...or just a lot was edited from the movie. the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie. also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning -- in other words -- they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself. and the title... no where in the movie does the title fit the movie...i suppose the title works for the previews.... actors did well with what they had.....if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have worked out better. but it didn't. so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday.... my opinion!....don't waste your time or money.

the movie started off strong, ll cool j (deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner sgt. lazerov (dylan mcdermott from the practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. the other big names (freeman, spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake (pollack) is introduced. given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake, i would choose the former. even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. i would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. everything he did in this film was unconvincing.just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. even hardcore n'sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.that aside there are a few plot holes, such as pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. this movie had so much promise. thoroughly disappointing.

beginning with the poster (featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey), the entire movie was a fraud. one stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - or nothing new, at least. after 10-15 minutes, you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop-flick.basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some city, all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town, under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. the almighty and above-the-law organization is called frat and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. frat cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. one hour later, after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system. bah! don't see this waste of film roll. freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether!

ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected! he did a fabulous job acting as a "renegade" cop within a "renegade" department. from the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in. he acts as a sort of "gentle giant" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. he was quite clearly the best character in the movie.this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards. after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down. his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. there are so many ways his character (moses ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. that he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. i was hoping to see more from him in this film.timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. this movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past. being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot-out.what irked me most was the way timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. he starts out having guns and not using them. then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo?! little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie. personally, it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic. make me believe that the story is true. this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied.

it's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any speeches. there's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. and finally last but not least the acting is appalling. for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this.

when thinking about captivity many words come to mind. among them are: uninteresting, unentertaining, unsuspensful, unsexy, unfathomable, and unwatchable.i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics. they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing, but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore and hip.this movie is a load of boring crap! what the hell has happened to larry cohen? his name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! even so, i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad! was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? did anyone not know it when they first saw him? only someone who has never before in his or her life, ever seen another movie!

i'll keep this short; thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly: captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink, imprisons and tortures her, then poses as a captive to have sex with her. that is the single twist and punchline of the film. it's torture as slow motion date rape. and, it's not even a good movie. it's not so bad it's good; it's just bad.it should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile. why no one had the cojones to step up and say, "this is garbage, and this is why," is beyond me.don't give your money to these poop-peddlers.

the only reason i give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on.this film is asinine. it's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder. the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting. i didn't care about any of the characters, but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap: i'd complain about the money i spent, but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining "live free or die hard," which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of "captivity" for 40 minutes.

absolutely fantastic. now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. much as i enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen). the two leads (daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne & celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence. the plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. what plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. for my part i came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.p.s. i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free...so i can afford to laugh about it. i was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was that bad.

the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor, a holocaust survivor, part of mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. the movie obviously had great reviews. it's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.i too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. "in one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center, the meaning of the word "forgive" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own" but by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more. after the "strong-willed" eva kor forgives her "nazi captors" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of kor. the movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory. to me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her "act of forgiveness". obviously, it was a very sick cow.on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the "promised land" to meet with some arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis, including one at a jewish center in chicago. from then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers. her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was. a rather annoyed dr sami advan (professor of education at bethlehem university) gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.finally, the debate at the jewish center in chicago, where she is "grilled" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.i will cut to the chase. by the end of the movie, i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie. the movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears. it showed that kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion. her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? quoting another imdb user, "i don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go." that would be the perfect layman's definition of making peace.i guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have "gone through more than the human mind can fathom".p.s. the dictionary certainly should go into all those books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making.

i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good, right? how wrong i was. i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever. there is nothing new with edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. some examples of just bad silly moments in edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head...this movie is the opposite of good.stay away from edison!

that is the only question i am left with. why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast? why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters? why did it not make any sense at all? why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "hollywood" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling? why? i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released. i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey, who are oscar winners, that this never is released to the big screens in america.as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism, the whole story is just utterly laughable. i just...think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a cliché, and an awful one at that. just. no.

wow. i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had.his acting was painful to observe. the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be ok.watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'kermit the frog' act in a hollywood blockbuster, just didn't work at all.

normally, i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest.you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet... well, this movie was just terrible. it is nigh on impossible to "suspend disbelief"; i tried, really, i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn't let me. timberlake should stick to music, what a dreadful performance - no presence as an actor,no character. can't blame everything on justin: the movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing; its definitely an "f".after seeing this, i have to wonder what really motivates actors. i mean, surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part. did he not see how poor it was? what then could motivate him to take the part? money? of course, acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work. ll cool j is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script. meanwhile, the audience goes: "what the hell is going on here? you expect me to believe this crap?"in short, apart from justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing.

i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in "edison." i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in "patton," or nathan lane to play jesus. but that is almost beside the point.timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role. i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent, but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench. with his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like "the 25 cliché expressions for actors," he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist. it simply will not fly.however, timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure. director david j. burke puts him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also places him aside morgan freeman, kevin spacey, john heard, dylan mcdermott, cary elwes and (i'm surprised he was as good) ll cool j. i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake.there is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief. a pleasure, if you will. freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air.but enough of timberlake bashing - words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick. "edison" is a very, very run-of-the-mill corruption story. it's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous. i do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which i interpret as an homage to films like "serpico," or "donnie brasco," or maybe even "chinatown." don't get me wrong - "edison" is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.the script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing. yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between piper perabo (who is wasted here) and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode. it's your typical far-too-glib-for-reality, let's-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail) dialogue. this dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like "edison" wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds (read slow-motion).thinking about it, "edison" is a curiosity. it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work. in film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. directors must make tough choices. david j. burke missed the mark here. some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture. and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.

my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show. i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. but he goes on watching it none the less. that is his right as an american i guess. but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode. it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can't stand. i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college. my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed, but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors. and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along (get the pun, ha,ha. like spielberg did. it's like jesus before he became a man. or thats at least what i think that would feel like. any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of peter falk. i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo's investigation, as many later episodes would do.

without wishing to be a killjoy, brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and camp blood being another. the acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself". maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?i bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. you'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.

i don't understand how "2 of us" receive such a high rating... i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense, followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble. however, i did like jared harris' performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours.

this movie is one long chiche after another. first of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot. the wigs and accents are terrible. they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons. john is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book. they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation "it was always just the two of us"! john would not have been mean to his fans like this either. like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday. an insulted john says something along the lines of "sure and while i croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin". that made me laugh for days. really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here. forget it.

as an impressionable 10 year old, i liked the "love conquers all" philosophy of the 70s sitcom "bridget loves bernie." i did understand the controversy, which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver (david birney) and an irish catholic school teacher (meredith baxter) and both sets of parents (harold j. stone and bibi osterwald as bernie's parents; audra lindley and david doyle as bridget's parents) who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage.looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences, i am amazed that the show was even a success for one, albeit, highly-rated season. created by veteran tv writer bernard slade, who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play "same time, next year", "bridget loves bernie" was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.there was no denying the real-life chemistry between birney and baxter. but, in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (birney in his short-lived role in "st. elsewhere" and baxter in "family" and "family ties"). here, they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge, which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses: "all in the family" and "mary tyler moore". both of those shows were smart, funny and had enough of an edge (more so on the former that the latter) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "bridget loves bernie" was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles.this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered.

this film was hard to get a hold of, and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. i mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. with all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talk-laden flick of this true-life event. while williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the d.b. cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off. harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty, but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction. shame on this film for even existing.

up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan. however, the new season had absolutely ruined it.the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light.i am neither christian or muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend. not any more.just cancel it and be done with it. it's not worth watching any more.it might still be saved, but a lot of change would need to be made.bring back the old format.

who likes awful "comedy" shows like little mosque on the prairie? the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are: one, muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. i'd be curious who even writes for this show? do you think it's actually muslims, or hip, funny young people? no, i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960's.when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are, air farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for "comedy" little mosque on the prairie. it is supposed to be offencive and funny? only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.

unlike many, i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive. its execution, however, is another matter entirely. like so many b-minus movies, all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers. for most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor. or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers. with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a canadian one.) notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas. unfortunately, they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies. the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (why? are they so hard to find in saskatchewan?) did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors? as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the cbc's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.

i was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. and talk about hype, i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. all of the characters are one-dimensional. the acting is - well - mediocre (i'm being nice). it's the classic cbc recipe - one that always fails.if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. it's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show.canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis. so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any?

this show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. well at least corner gas was good at first, little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. who are the people who are watching this show anyway, i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas. hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show.

if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. lmotp really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess.beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing. and once the "zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao!!" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don't see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.

i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all. the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about! i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. but there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters. the "fresh of the boat" dad, who doesn't understand his daughter. the radical feminist muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor, i only see him getting better).it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed, and don't really care to watch another episode.i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again, she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does, too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities!

little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen. they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for cbc means 85 year old farmers in saskatchewan. the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can't believe it. the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded. very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as "controversial" well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes, royal canadian air farce and rick mercer's report.

this series just gets worse and worse. poorly written and just plain not funny! the premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about, and resorted to that patronizing, smug, "oh, silly you" style acting that comes with a no laugh script. they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, aren't we zany? isn't this funny? well, no, it's not actually. gum disease is less painful. no wonder, with the exception of corner gas, canadians generally avoid canadian tv. come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent. pull the plug on this amateurish mess.

once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode. last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter. how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists? ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses. but not 30 minutes. it's called beating a dead horse. even snl would know to give up after a commercial break.also, let's have a little conflict in these scripts. will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan? when will ramadan start? ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here. and the characters! what characters?! they are all cardboard cut-outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next. that's the point of the situation comedy. we need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week. we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week. if i never see these characters it'll be too soon. thankfully i can't remember any of their names (note to cbc - that's not a good sign).and the acting is so bland. it's more so a problem in casting than in the actors. none of these people actually embody the characters they play. they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week. sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character the portray. watch any american sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying. that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows. but to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture. as another commenter mentions, this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom.and the directing or lack there of! what can i say, canada has so much talent, look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up. look at the trailer park boys (not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog). look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work.give credit to the cbc, they really know how to build publicity for a non-event. remember "the one"? no - well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show, as it's sure to go the way of the dodo.let's all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while.

i enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second-run theatre in the early '80's. i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings. but to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction i think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky. the rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means "not worth sitting through even once".still, i too would jump at a chance to have a second look.

this is one of those films that i could only sit through once. charlotte henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. the problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen, gary cooper, w.c. fields and cary grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). the movie just clumped along with no cohesion. much of lewis carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. what a pity! it's such a great book. i would recommend disney's 1951 version.

a family moves into a old house in japan. but there's a catch it's haunted (boo!!!). aw, didn't mean to make you jump. it's only a review. settle back down. ahem, now anyways it's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion. this naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8. horrid acting. horrid story. but how bad can it be you ask? well it was so bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips. it was so bad whenever doug mcclure came on-screen i prayed that i had flashbacks of small wonder (yes, i know doug was in "out of this world" & not "small wonder", but it's pretty much the same damn show, & i can hum the "small wonder" theme better) there are movies that are so bad they're good. this isn't one of thosewhere i saw it: showtime beyondmy grade: f-eye candy: mako hattori gets topless,susan george gets 2 love scenes ( one nude, one just topless)

this is a rotten movie.the cast seem to know just how bad it was.it starts badly and by the end is truly bad.the acting is woeful.the script could of been written on the spot.and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes.crap 1 out of 10

i saw this film at a pre-release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills. as i recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film.if the audience wasn't scared, it seems the filmmakers were. they delayed release for over a year. out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as i can tell, they hadn't. it was the same lousy movie, just a year older.it almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow-paced and boring.

aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting, this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia. i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a "good movie."

while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. i'm not even sure where to begin as i've got so many problems with this movie. i suppose i'll just number a few of them: 1. the acting  when you see that edward albert, doug mcclure, and susan george (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly a-list names. susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy, but i've never considered her the greatest actress i've ever seen. and in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. as for the other two, the less said the better.2. the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at disney world. and, they are about as frightening. and why did they have to be so obvious? subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells.3. the plot  how predictable can one movie be? the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. if you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.4. the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks? not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. absurd is a word that comes to mind.5. everything else  it's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. i suppose i'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture. that's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie.i'll stop. you should be able to get the idea from what i've already mentioned. and, i haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems. be warned, this thing is horrible.

film starts in 1840 japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide. it's a very gory, bloody sequence. then it jumps to present day...well 1982 to be precise. ted (edward albert), wife laura (susan george) and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby's work. they rent a house and--surprise! surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! the three dead people are around as ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family.sounds ok--but it's really hopeless. there's a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between. there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious! they look so fake--i swear i saw the strings pulling one along--and they're muttering!!!!! there's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show off george's body), another one about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary to the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed.as for acting--albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend. but george--as always--is terrific in a lousy film. she gives this film a much needed lift--but can't save it. i'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing. that aside, this is a very boring film.

at the beginning of the film, you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. it's not "memoirs of a geisha" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery. he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). cut to present day, when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. from then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. let's start with the good aspects, namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench (well, together with britt eckland, linda hayden and ingrid pitt). the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter. the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! in this "possessed" state, she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. so, strictly spoken, it's not really "evil" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in "ghostbusters". "the house where evil dwells" is probably the least scary ghost movie ever. throughout most of the running time, you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films "motel hell" and "from beyond the grave") intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top, like "motel hell" maybe. but then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. "the house where evil dwells" is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights. well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter's bedroom. how totally random and irrelevant was that? if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba.

this could have been interesting  a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to! besides, it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as, generally, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as susan george seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! at one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, he's called upon to exorcise the premises. however, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure, possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! at the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.

giant crabs cursing in japanese? what was in that drink? a terrible movie, but laughable. i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around. drink much beer before you see this movie.

from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but i didn't think it was that bad. i've seen much worse, actually."the house where evil dwells" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, ted and laura fletcher, and their daughter, amy, who move into an old house in japan. little do they know, a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. as strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. it was routine, and it was corny, but i've seen worse in my day. the ghost sequences were a little over-done, we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. to be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland. i may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the japanese horror film "ju-on: the grudge" and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little. the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc. but i may be wrong.to sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot. 4/10.

en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. and that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with joe haggerty, as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson, giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.to be fair, some of sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. these positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, the zombie chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.i give the zombie chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3d (although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).

this movie is not based on the bible. it completely leaves christ out of the movie. they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ. let alone talk about it. it does not quote from scriptures. the end times are called the great tribulation. the movie does not even show bad times. the seven bowls, seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure. the anti-christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended. the only part they got correct was there was two prophets. the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures. the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie. i wanted to take unsaved people to it. i feel that the movie is evil. it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does. i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books.the second problem with the movie is it was just bad. bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. i have seen better episodes of miami vice.

i caught this at a test screening. all i can say is: what...the...hell? this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for "scarface." it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense; and even if you do leave your brain in the car, the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny.the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to "save" a crocodile which contains a cia probe. the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back, irwin mistakes them for poachers, and sets out to "stop" them.that's about all the story there is; the rest is over-the-top lampooning of australian culture ("didja see dat?" and "crikey!") and strangely choreographed action sequences. at one point, irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it. yes, that's right: steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv. let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film.

ok, first of all, steve irwin, rest in peace. you were loved by many fans. now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. it was "the crocodile hunter" tv program with bad acting, bad scripts, and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals. he was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. millions will miss him. but the whole movie idea was a big mistake. the plot was so broken, it was almost non-existent. casting was horrible. the acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. the direction must be faulted as well. if you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you must not be that good in the first place. i could have written a better script. i wish i had never been to see this movie. of course, i watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me, $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action. my son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie alright, but he still has never asked to see it again. if you want fond memories of steve irwin, buy his series on dvd. avoid this movie like the plague. if i were steve, i know i wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. respect him: avoid this movie!

there's tons of good-looking women in this flick. but alas, this movie is nudity-free. grrrrrrrrrr strike one.ahem. one story in this film takes place in 1971. then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage? hello? continuity, anyone?as you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d. and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen. i'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there was no 3d, just double-vision blurs. i didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3d movies, hunting season and camp blood. sure, the 3d in those ones sucked too, but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect.this thing is a big ball of nothing.and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! i'd like to see more of her. in movies, as well. looks like janet margolin at a young age. purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

i never was an avid viewer of "crocodile hunter", but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about steve irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. this movie, with steve and his wife, terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but i didn't hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. well, now i have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a bit better. apparently, it's supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all.a u.s. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia, where it is swallowed by a crocodile! while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt, and are unaware of what's inside it, two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon! the agents are assisted by jo buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! on steve and terri's mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just the crocodile, and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it, when steve sees the cia agents after them, he mistakes them for poachers! not only did i not laugh once while watching this film, the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents. apart from that, i don't think i found anything even mildly amusing. it's also a bit of an incoherent mess, switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters, and it seems like clips from "crocodile hunter" and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as brozzie drewitt, played by magda szubanski, is supposed to be, she's not. at one point, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a major cliché in modern comedy! are they so hard to resist?! i also found the typical "crocodile hunter" scenes, with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers, to be tedious, but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn't help.steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. no matter which side you're on, "the crocodile hunter: collision course" is not a well crafted movie. i'm sure it does help if you're a big steve irwin fan, but even if you are, there's no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven't been impressed. in fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have, so maybe it won't help. like i said, there's no guarantee. i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. the attempt to combine what is usually seen in "crocodile hunter" with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!

some people say steve irwin's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act. watch this film: it's obvious he can't act.steve irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his *crocodile hunter diaries*, *croc files* and eponymous *crocodile hunter* series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?), rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with *crocodile hunter: collision course* (yup  there's a definite trend of words beginning with 'c') - basically an episode of *crocodile hunter* mashed together with a b-movie.on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (magda szubanski), steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies (lachy hulme and kenneth ransom), out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed. will it hurt my credibility to say "they're on a collision course with wackiness"? (what credibility? - ed note.)the plot is irrelevant, as it is steve's animal magnetism that propels the film. if you find his persona trying, the film is a failure, but if you're a fan of either him (as a businessman, conservationist or just plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget.john stainton, faithful liege, best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter *oeuvre* (can it be called that with a straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester.the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks) and terri (steve's spouse of 10 years, fiercest ally and closest friend) treat it like it is one of their documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and speaking directly to the camera, whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie (well). it wouldn't be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve's life, we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics, or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting, crisp audio and seven action angles. while terri is unfairly painted as steve's mildly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last, i'm not complaining), steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, well, to him they're not really stunts, just a day at the office. of course, watching this madman's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings. but to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *crocodile hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints so enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend. he died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that.(movie maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)

the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times.it may sound weak and cliché but it's true; you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin. it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure. for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren't good actors, not even when they play themselves! their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.the movie had quite some potential, i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was; brilliant! the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. the movie does has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still, i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.watching this movie felt like a waste of time. still this movie might be watchable just once, when it gets on tv, on a rainy afternoon. it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.4/10

i saw this film yesterday.. i rented the dvd from blockbuster.. in fact, i know one of the actresses from the film.. i won't say who..! (that's kept under wraps..) but i must admit, it wasn't as good as i thought it would be.. tom savini? hats down to this guy.. but it's a shame he wasn't in the film for long.. what lacks the film is the idea, the script, sound, etc.. it may look like a good movie.. but it wasn't that entertaining..well, i'm glad my sister paid £10 for renting 3 dvd's from blockbuster.. i chose this one.. and i was disappointed. anyway, thumbs down for me..! not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!

i couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it. it's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. the shots used are disgusting, they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time. my head hurts try to watch that load of "you know what". dirt on the "mystery machine" window make you see light from the lighting on the windows...annoying. what else... it's so badly framed all the time it's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there. i only directed short films, but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film.... the story is unbelievable, just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it's gonna be pretty awful. so pretty much, try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost, it'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental, and that 1h30 hour of your life you'll never get back...

if you liked "blair with" you'll like this one. it has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.it also has tom savini, so if you like romero's "dawn of the dead" or tarantino and rodriguez' "from dusk till dawn" you're in for a treat. he is an icon and a very good actor as well.no, seriously. this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time, and i've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well. i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but this was just a pure waste of time.the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth... no, i'm just kidding. i must have missed before i hit "submit" on the vote form.stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!

when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow.1)the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local. dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens. what, who, how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst. 2)the van will break down. 3)whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)they will find a house inhabited by a madman, he will capture them. 5) the house will have a phone but it will not work, it will be disturbingly decorated, there will be flickering neon light, spiders and maggots. 6)the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor). 7)the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap, weak scare and will then be killed properly. 8)only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9)there will be an unnecessary twist at the end. add to these elements naked sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens, throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie.i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film, darkhunters, which is one of the worst films i have ever seen. at times the cinematography is very good, the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies. i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity. however, the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again, but amongst the dvd extras.if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief. there is more to say about this than the film itself. one staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea. he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if "people will get it". i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough, acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work. if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; "what was the point?" this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies, any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked.the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats. they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use. however, the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary. there is a simple distinction to be made here; mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant.the best moment is reserved for robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film. those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that. i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule. the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers, complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born. as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting, they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant.the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast. robert's swears blind in voice over, 'i didn't want to make a film that was like baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. there is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is "the best british film in years". i don't know who he is trying to convince. at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly "i can see people sitting at home saying "this isn't amazing, its sh$t" he isn't wrong.

ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves. anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and tom savini! there is just no way this movie can fail! right? wrong!! it just seems like such a waste! there was really no story, the dialog was terrible (is anyone there? x 1000!!!), the characters were.. well, they really lacked any kind of personality... the effects were terrible.. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing.. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff? we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something... anything to happen... but no... "oh, here comes the nymphs! great! oh.. they're kissing... again... and now for the violence! ok... nothing really happens... again... oh, now they run around... and the closeups of eyes... again... oh, heres tom savini! oh... he died... right... ok, maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen.. no.. oh! cool! a severed head! the end... oh crap.." and finally, since i'm so full of myself.. i'll tell you this! give me a van, six actors, a weird looking house, tom savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen... i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this... what is this johannes guy doing?? making cool movies is easy!it could have been so great... i'm really upset!!

i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with "book of shadows", i was wrong. this film makes that look like "the magnficiant ambersons" compared to this piece of shameless, unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie. i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it, bobbins.and were these people english? and where is the forest> i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands. the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation. those angels looked like anorexic pornstars (turned most of them were, did my research). i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces.p.s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act

rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to "ordinary people"--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. what with robert duvall, glenn close, and wilford brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of "the natural". too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****

*spoiler warning*first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10.the idea is good, but there are too many stupid errors in the movie, failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been. first of all she never fights alone. after an initial very strange doubt from her mother (which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie) the rape victim is not alone. she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew's strange traps. her friends are unbelievably nasty.the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon. ethan is very much the leader of the crew (hey, they even say so) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk, but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong. everyone just simply hates him... why?? the movie provides no explanation. how did he ever become the leader?a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in. two actors from the same successful tv-series.... a cheap way to get viewers?

diana guzman is an angry young woman. surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. the film progresses from there, as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. michelle rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. there are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. this is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. its limitations prevent it from being placed in the "see it again and again" category.

i'm sorry, i had high hopes for this movie. unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream, i felt cheated. surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.so, don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room. my kids didn't enjoy it either. ah well.

no fireworks despite violent action.science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter. with essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer paolo mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.

universal soldier: the return is not the worst movie ever made. no, that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner. however, perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier: the return. this film is a sci-fi/action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it. the acting is as bad as any movie i've ever seen. the plot is terrible and predictable. the special effects are pathetic. in short, anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves. us: the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces. some movies are so bad, they're good. believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them. i'm really not sure what else to say here. i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already, but just in case: don't.

i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it. the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony. they fly to the moon in a space-age dustbin carrier; when there, they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase.it strikes me that rubbish low-budget sci-fi films often involve either desert planets or, like this movie, criminals escaping from penal colonies. why this is i have no idea. but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical. this one is really no exception. it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half-way alright dance music soundtrack. it then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review, so if you're reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film's subtleties and nuances. for the record, i recall a tedious bunch of baddies, a tedious bunch of goodies, some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. other than that, i'm struggling.if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film. i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.

this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie. cheap looking, and worst of all, boring action scenes! the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence. only 82 minutes, but it feels like it goes on forever! even die-hard van damme fans(like myself) should avoid this one!

ok, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. that's it. that's the good stuff. the acting...fair. the plot...silly. the "twist"... unnecessary. dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for "plagues" and how to contain them? proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after katrina. but they have a plan. it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania. and if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the "shooters' standing there with no protection? in fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? that would stop her. but not as dramatic. i'm a sucker. i always watch a movie to see the end, once i started it. but this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv. rubbish.

in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. however, i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan. he organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next pot noodle is going to come from. anyway, de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. it's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. brilliant! to his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. they want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. by a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. he uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. i reckon this film was a missed opportunity. to address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. how come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. de sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.

ouch! this one was a bit painful to sit through. it has a cute and amusing premise, but it all goes to hell from there. matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances. alan bates and jennifer tilly, among others, played it way over the top. i know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame actors, when the script and director have them do such schlock. if you're going to have outrageous characters, that's ok, but you gotta have good material to make it work. it didn't here. run away screaming from this movie if at all possible.

the idea is nice. bringing so many stars in one movie is great. but.... too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense. no connection between the scenes. there were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. the frame reminded me of "all the invisible children" - a movie which i liked a lot. compared to it, however, "paris je t'aime" lacks the intriguing short story, which develops - starts and has its end. and it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting. otherwise, i wouldn't recommend it...

thoughtless, ignorant, ill-conceived, career-killing (where is the talented angela jones now?), deeply unfunny garbage. it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of quentin tarantino himself, and creates something like this, anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world, doesn't deserve a second break. under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they're told to do, and they do it well. it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place. 0 out of 4.

be warned: this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence.the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways.each story has only a few minutes, so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot. just an sketchy idea of a plot. the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer. however, that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these "jokes" were just silly.this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart. a dozen times. or even more, i don't know and i don't care.

from it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances, curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout. the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino's name is attached to it, and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez/tarantino flick 'from dusk till dawn'. these things do not make a great movie, however, and this is more than evident all the way through 'curdled'. the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas, and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool, but it's becomes annoying very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican, it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. the film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who, because of her obsession with grisly murders, takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. it sounds boring and it is.william baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list, and even he doesn't make an impression. he hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing, he's pretty much wasted. angela jones, or rather; the taxi driver from pulp fiction, takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability. she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself. she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it weren't for her latino accent; she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level. curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash. films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels. whether you're a tarantino fan, william baldwin fan, horror fan or just a movie buff; this is one to miss.

excruciatingly slow-paced, over-scripted black comedy with a too-clever premise and bad acting.maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode, but by the last half, you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already.

geordies...salt of the earth characters...bricklayers...beer...geordies...happy go lucky...adventures working abroad...salt of the earth characters...warm wonderful people...tyne bridge (tear in the eye)...brown ale...salt of the earth characters...cute little red indians children in newcastle united tops...emetic...geordies...salt of the earth characters...etc etc etc....please. this is so poor. and you should know better timothy spall. they can't have paid you that much.as for jimmy nail. well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an 'actor' as he is a singer and writer. come on jimmy, the joke's over. 'crocodile shoes' and 'spender' were very funny, unfortunately i don't think they were supposed to be. with 'auf wiedersehen pet' the opposite applies.

based upon the recommendation of a friend, my wife and i invited another couple to this film. i really apologized to them--all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end. half the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. there were few scenes of paris--for example, i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter, but i couldn't really recognize anything. most of the scene was inside a bar. no one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. if you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual films, don't miss this. if you are down to earth like me, you will be sorry you saw it.

i saw "paris je t'aime" because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him. going in, i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production. the "stories" are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful. what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris? the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non-french feel. the clichés about paris were endless. yes, most of them were playing with clichés about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichés, they directly and regrettably promoted them once more. yes, paris is the city of love. we get it.the worst segments were: the one directed by wes craven (oscar wilde); the one with nick nolte; the mime one (the worst?); the hair products one; the one with juliette binoche (willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris?); the vampire one (when i think of paris i think of elijah wood). the one with natalie portman, which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid (the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him). on and on it went. it felt endless.i didn't like the coen bros one as well. it really plays with those parisien clichés but i didn't find it funny. just annoying. the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight (and the punchline was obvious) that it barely registered.there were only two "successful" segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman. nice irony there. and the segment about the african who is stabbed. it's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris. the story could have taken place in any city around the world.the last segment, the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad. they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending.the whole project felt forced and uninspired. almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism. all in all, with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff, "paris je t'aime" was an awful cinematic experience.

only a handful of the segments are engaging here. a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking. one with fanny ardent & bob hoskins makes its point, twist by twist until the final shot overplays things. the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris. the others are so scatter-shot in theme, tone, volition & production that you may as well be watching "the years best commercials, 2006." it's really all over the place. it doesn't develop over it's running time, and nothing reigns the directors in. no construct successfully joins the pieces... tedium sets in. i'm at the one hour, twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb, over-commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic. fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment (uh, thanks j & e for ruining another movie) and then makes way too many appearances. the point of being in paris is that you don't need make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary. why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director? has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire film. every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless. the transitions get lost. this doesn't feel intentional, it feels sloppy.

my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory. however, of the 10 pages of reviews, only a handful are negative. i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future.i admit, i'm more inspired to write reviews when i don't like a movie than as to when i do, so my handful of reviews are all negative. still, that doesn't mean i'm biased towards not enjoying a movie, but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy.paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie i've seen in years. by using an "intelligent" concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories, the movie ends up the worst of all worlds. it is art for arts sake, but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish. giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment. directors can't write, writers can't direct. (i'd like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated, but that is because he's an actor turn director {which rarely works, either}).what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don't make any sense, are not completed in 5 minutes and in total, spoil paris to me. why call it paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck? there are only a couple stories that are watchable, most notably the piece by alfonso cuarón, but everything else will fall into obscurity. the coen brothers short is passable, but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar? it's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it. as we all love paris, present company included, we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks. in fact, i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes. seriously. seriously.people, natalie portman is not a good actress. she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours. and maggie gyllenhaal, why?!? are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies? i'm looking at you natalie portman (garden state, closer), elijah wood (sin city) and catalina sandino moreno (maria full of grace).one final comment on the acting: i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again. find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable.writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right. i'm thinking of ernst hemingway, raymond carver, f. scott fitzgerald, and john cheever, just to name a few. it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this. the same can be said about short films. it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history.if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story, then don't expect to enjoy this movie at all. the directors either didn't care or were lazy. in either scenario, by the time you are reading this it means you rented it. praise be that you didn't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it.

i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival. most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but i didn't. it stars lucas haas (brick, alpha dog), molly parker (kissed, the five senses, hollywoodland) and adam scott (first snow, art school confidential). the director is matt bissonnette, who's married to molly parker. all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful. the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and i thought it needed to be the other way around.

i have seen some bad movies (austin powers - the spy who shagged me, batman forever), but this film is so awful, so boring, that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest. a pity. boasting talent such as kenneth branagh, embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham, what went wrong? branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with davitz. her father (duvall) is a psychopath who hanged her cat, etc, etc, so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse, and he promptly escapes. somehow (i couldn't figure out how) robert downey jr, daryl hannah, famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary. i wanted to like this, and, being a huge grisham fan, have read all about this movie and i (foolishly) expected something interesting. this is honestly the worst film i've seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded. * out of *****.

a very weak movie, mainly because of a poor story, but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr., and irrational behaviour by many of the characters. if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it's creativity or acting criteria, then you may like this movie. personally i can't do that with a drama and found this too far-fetched.i'm particularly annoyed when a main character, that is supposed to be an intelligent person, continually acts like a complete imbecile. in this movie, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie.the first highly unlikely act is when the main character, a successful attorney named magruder, played by kenneth branagh, is leaving a party and happens upon a girl, mallory doss played by embeth davidtz, who is screaming that her car has been stolen. they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home.she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things. when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town, they notice that her car is in the driveway. also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken.things are very odd, she's weird (looking like a tramp, she undresses in front of him until she's completely naked  oh yeah!). also, the father's strange, the house is a wreck -- everything should have told magruder, "hey this is too weird for me, i'm out of here!' but not magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by her story and sex, takes up the case of trying to have her father committed. it all screams set-up!then, being the top-flight attorney that he is, he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before, (a fact that all of the women in the office notice). is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16-year-old? magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming, with ample evidence, that the father is terrorising them, the police ignore him. i could have believed begrudging assistance. but no help at all -- not likely!it's just too unlikely.

the first hour of the movie was boring as hell. there is no suspense, no action, not even a plot. the movie went no where. i mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film. overall, the movie wasn't good at all, and i don't recommend it.

i can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot, and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending. but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i've ever wasted my time on. it's just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh's character around by his nose. the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer, which has been left out in the sun too long. the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham-movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie. don't waste your time here!

i should never have started this film, and stopped watching after 3/4's. i missed the really botched ending. this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. it had nice atmosphere, a top notch cast and director, good locations. but a baaaaaad story line, a bad script. i paid attention to kenneth branagh's southern accent--it was better than the script. the plot was stupid--driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways. no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts.

the only thing remarkable about this movie? is that all the actors could bomb at the same time. idiocy. i want my money back...and i got it free from the library. sheesh. i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again.

i'll give writer/director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived "thriller." a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo, let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs. a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes, although the art direction is not half bad. the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit; this is storytelling at its worst. no tension, no suspense, no dread, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom, but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer. i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing. good for late-night, zoned-out viewing only. you have been warned.

a splendid example of how hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up.in the case of "the big sky," writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize-winning author, a.b. guthrie. in so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation.the epic nature of guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, boone caudill, from a naive, kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man, has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent. in the movie version, boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming.intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever. most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character, who was an incidental, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages. on the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, dick summers, the veteran pioneer, is missing altogether!!! it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie, played by actor hunnicutt, wasn't irritating enough. so zeb/hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious, voice-over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing, editing, and direction.some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (william wyler's "ben-hur" is an excellent example). but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself.the story is dull and clichéd, and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie's literary vision. and unfortunately, kirk douglas' star appeal, which could have helped lift this film, was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given.if you can believe it, the film version of guthrie's pulitzer prize-winning sequel, "the way west," also starring kirk, is even worse.in my opinion, "the big sky" further solidifies howard hawks' place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of cinema.

anyone that has see tammuz's child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better. let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot (telefilm anyone?)and that is was a case of second feature jitters. the characters are one dimensional and over used. the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully.the cinematography is great. shot almost entirely outside, the images are crisp and beautiful. you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves.technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart.

characters you don't care about, relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start. julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other. she was actually somewhat endearing in this role.

i found this film to be an utter dissapointment. the talent available to the director- notably stanley tucci, chris walken, hank azaria and alan arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. julia roberts is feeble, zeta-jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.for what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible spoilers)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack's role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever. (spoilers) azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (spoilers) we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. pure genius.for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross-out, teen-movie' humour at times.a very poor 4/10.

billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter, but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face.... or perhaps just one. they call it comedy, i say it's a waste of my time.

in fact, it never was. i'm not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy. what a vacuous shambles! none of these people come close to a cary grant, spencer tracy, katherine hepburn, etc, and anyway, today's audience isn't as receptive to this facile muck. writing is trivial. the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious. the chemistry between the leading characters is non-existent. it's interesting that julia roberts seems to think she's a reincarnation of some big star from the "golden age of hollywood", whenever that may be. it's an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride.

the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it(the crazy filmdirector)the rest of the movie was just boring.in the first hour or so nothing really happens.jokes which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck (yeah right!) into the girl next door (where did i see this before?) who gets the guy.for short.i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters.if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch.

first of all, i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply. in my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant.however, the acting is near perfect. in fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked; talent! all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (like janset) at least, altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast. other than that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women. and just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema. just close your ears and o something real artistic, i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work. hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach.in short; pros > good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) cons> each and every single thing, other than the cast

terrible movie. if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006, that should be banyo. what a waste of time. other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing, nada, zilch, nil. the dialog is cheap, and sexual clichés are all over it. the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own. the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do. if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting. the only good thing i can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there is nothing good i can say about it. i must have really disliked it to write about it this much. jeez!

this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible. as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film, how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago, but then again i saw this video. in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe, yet this movie lacks them all. you heard me it lacks them all. there is not a single point i like about this movie, none. i hate it. i'm sure anyone will do so too. the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff, yet it fails even at the nudity. i don't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so, and i definitely recommend you don't do so. worst movie i've seen in my entire life. if someone offers you to watch it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife

i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival. based on a novella by science- fiction author brian aldiss, this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe, conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band.almost deliberately gimmicky, the film is also too clever by half (if you'll pardon the pun). by mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha) lose their way pretty quickly. i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not. flashbacks, dream sequences, it was all just a bit much. plus, the promised rock and roll just didn't move me. i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch, a film i found original and moving. but in this case, the songs just weren't as good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine.

this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. it stars shaquille o'neil and is about a rapping genie. apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece. the movie gets 1 out of 10.

would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball. this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level. in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp. he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra. this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world, the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it.

this film proves that the "commercial" cinema ,or else,the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis.there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille's name.there is no worth referring to the plot :it is a bit more perplexed than a knot.what else?the screen is somewhat dim,o'neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse.rating: 1 / 10.

what a pathetic movie.i won't waste much time commenting about it. i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it.let me leave it simply with - shaq has no business being an actor or singer. he is utterly without talent at both discplines. it's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds.much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is shaq.

i'm a fan of columbo, especially on a rainy saturday, and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very lacking. the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance, even years before the modern detective shows of today. but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and "modern" electronics equipment and, of course, the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale. the high-tech home is a jetson's or disney version of tomorrowland, and fun to think of writers inventing those "way-out gizmos".if its sunny outside, go play, as there are much better columbo episodes. still, we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast.

manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa, parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjsthis movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringethe british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life, the masks of amitabh haha and moredirection by manmohan desai is bad music is okayamitabh does his part with style, nothing different from coolie, laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual, nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual

bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan's mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated. manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag,parvarish,amar akbar anthony,naseeb,desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed. my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2,maybe mr desai ran out of ideas, after all he had been using that formula for years and years. 1. first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa, for instance the police inspector who brings up amar, the muslim who brings up akbar, nirupa roy and a few more. 2. in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight, in mard she loses her voice 3. in aaa there is the famous song (shirdi wale sai baba)well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali. having seen aaa for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away.my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous, true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far. my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing. i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn't like it one bit. it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child.

this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen.i have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. i found them pretty bad: it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story. the archaeologists are looking for "the set". they do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt.if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.the action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. it made the movie look short, and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie.

i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently, and the sci-fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find. as such, i'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion. the acting was uncharacteristically sub-par, as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has in store for us. there are a few cameos made by people you'd most likely recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. the cgi special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci-fi feature is lacking. sure, there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he's known for a couple of days, but overall, it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter, and i consider that a major disappointment.if i was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made-for tv movies, i'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. a real shame that i may have to wait 'till the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh, and i really hope that this movie isn't part of some overall quality increase in sci-fi original movies.

worse than the rating it has been given. this is a typical scifi movie nowadays: bad to awful acting, a script that is poorly written, and shoddy direction. from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end, this movie is terrible. in the beginning scenes this movie has moses (which was charlton heston in the demille film), pharoah (yul brynner) and nefretiri (anne baxtor) overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand. the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to "supposedly" be. the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance. the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality.

tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the 20's during the filming of demille's first version of the 10 commandments and which is reawakened when demille's sets are unearthed in the desert.one of the worst films i've seen in a long time.the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.you will laugh long and hard at this film, probably more than many other hollywood "comedies".

watching the first 30 minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes. it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy. the setup was promising, in the 1920's cecil b. demille makes his opus of the ten commandments. it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci-fi channel movie). the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect. then the body counts starts. this is were the movie went south for me. the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? they make the usual stop to the "guy who knows the truth but never told anyone". after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? no, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. really i'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem. after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way, by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades. for a sci-fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out, which isn't saying much at all. what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it.

i'm at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this "poppycock" of a movie. they had a pretty interesting idea, with the buried movie set, and that was it. so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. there is the buried set, some wolf headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is. what i would have missed, had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase, some really bad c.g.i., some incredibly stupid dialog, more bad c.g.i., and the hero fighting paper cut outs. other than the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. my mistake for continuing to watch. - merk

while the idea is more original than most sci-fi movies, the execution is, as usual lacking. while the practical mummy effects are not bad, and the "gun nut" character is over the top giggle inducing, the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen. i suspect that was the idea all along. they do the best they can with what they have but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when morena's character sported some tomb raider style shorts. not high brow cinema i know but you can't deny true beauty when you see it!!! and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate. if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you. if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere.

reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves. the end result is a disaster. alice tremblay's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it's audience (i didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation), going through it's page-thin story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the magic it wished it had. the 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set, let alone on paper. 'l'odyssée d'alice tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches, linked together with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. avoid or boredom will haunt you.

just saw this movie, and what a waste of time. the movie was predictable and slow. it's basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball. rather than watching this movie, i should have had a root canal. the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball, however because it's rated pg, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film. the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard. thurl bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.

this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet. it made the rm & sons of provo look like well done films! it was supposed to be funny from what i was told. the best part was the best actor in the movie-travis eberhard-if he wasn't in the movie it probably wouldn't have been made! he ruled!10. it wasn't funny 9. it was beat 8. it had thurl big t bailey, who's character made no sense 7. it was made in provo 6. it didn't make fun of brokeback 5. it had larry h. miller in it 4. it was the 1st movie clint howard wasn't funny in 3. gary coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2. they should have cast at surreal life auditions 1. it was made by halestorm entertainment!!

this movie is a total dog. i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money--and my time. the writing in this film is absolutely terrible. it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies.they should have saved the money on getting d-list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role.this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. after viewing this movie, i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. i should have gone to the dentist instead!

i went to see this film with fairly low expectations, figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff. sadly, it wasn't even that. i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out. i went with my two kids (ages 10 and 13) and even they kept asking, "how much longer?" after lasting until the end, i just kept wondering who would approve this script. even the reliable fred willard couldn't save the trite dialogue, the state jokes, and the banal plot. i'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie (i use the term loosely) should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class. at the least, there are many books on directing, screen writing, and producing movies that would teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.

the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget "halestorm entertainment" has had to work with. all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash. not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful, but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best. the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc. the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing. i think just because i couldn't believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the "film".

trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout mormons, and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film. finally kurt hale's fortunes have changed (thank goodness) and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters.the cinematography was amateurish (i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). the plot was limp and very unfunny. you really didn't understand why anyone did anything. it was like i had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was that painful.the only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me.

first of all, let me say the i am lds or rather, i am a mormon. so when i watched this film, i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch. and this one was no exception. it does have its redeeming moments. but they are few and far between.one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church! in the lds church, congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". never once are either of these two names mentioned. the church is never referred to by name and "the standards" is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes.it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes? this film had so much potential! it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired. if i were not already lds, i'd be left thinking mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs.it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends.sorry halestorm. you can do better than this!

i've never been a huge fan of mormon films. being a mormon, i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos. i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air, the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non-mormon friends.boy, was i wrong.i figured, since this had b-list talent like clint howard, gary coleman, andrew wilson, and fred willard (one of my favorites), this would have to be at least a little funny. and besides, church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such. but i must say, throughout the entire movie, it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing. every joke fell flat, and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored. the dialogue was bland, and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen. every single character but wilson's was less than one-dimensional. it's hard to believe that after nine re-writes the film was still as mind-numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed. i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this. my friends and i were extras in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in washington city, ut. kurt hale, the director, was there, and i must say, i avoided all contact with him after the show. he waited at the door, seemingly ready for feedback. i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life, but it left a nasty, painful scar that i will never forget.here are a few specific problems i had: there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player, but these two characters came out of nowhere, and were impossible to care about, so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame, uninteresting characters. there were many subplots that popped up every now and then, each promising the audience the chance for laughs, but each one came and went in a puff of smoke, ending before you could even start caring. this was pretty much how the whole movie felt.this film was a major letdown, and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie. true, the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons. then again, it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears.please, do not see this movie. keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. spare yourself the disappointment i went through

i wanted to like this film, i really did. it's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat. it tries too hard to be funny in some places (the daughters over zealous cooking attempts), over reaches in others (the scene where they clean up someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, while mildly interesting, are really just filler (all the work scene's). and i didn't find the "villians" intimidating, or worth hating, so much as i found them to be childishly annoying. i've met people like those in the film while playing church ball. and i will say the referee's are spot on, still, in the end, i really didn't care all that much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. maybe because they were all so one dimensional, which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall. kurt hale, and halestorm entertainment, has made some good films, but this is not one of them.

every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people. if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.where to begin my discussion of pain. for starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. there was no character development. every character was a stereotype. we had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation. have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. the concept for this movie sounded so funny. how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. but trust me when i say this, things went wrong, very wrong.

i was not expecting much going in to this, but still came away disappointed. this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen. i thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but i only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes. is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over? what was up with the janitor in heaven scene? fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations, but this did not work. they must have spent all the budget on getting "known" actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket? i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.

this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen! some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor. this nail trap catches these bad guys. the rest of the movie degrades as you go. i can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time. i also can't believe that there are sequels! the next crap movie that i want to watch is r.o.t.o.r. could r.o.t.o.r really be much worse than this?

first, let's all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. however, in this piece of @*!^ called snakeeater, the film industry as a whole sank.first, let's start with the plot. a vietnam vet named jack kelly, aka soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with.now, the acting. being an actor myself, i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art!!!!! lamas is, well, himself. the jackasses playing the clampets/deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!finally, the action. the gunfighting is so-so at best, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. i've seen more real-looking fights at the renaissance festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!readers, listen to me: avoid this piece of caca at all costs! if it were the only film in existence, you still would want to avoid it! for the sake of your brain-cell count, do not watch this thing!

this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. this is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices i've made in film rentals.i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it. the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender.the "skits" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of "vince offer" (whoever that is).unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of rubbish.

i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago, and said to myself, "seems funny, plus it has michael clarke duncan, how can i lose!" i proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it. i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted. wooden performances abound. all the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never seemed to arrive. after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame, knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back. i literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered "comedy" i didn't want to believe in movies anymore. my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone. this was my next horrible mistake, because as i watched i just became angry. i began to yell at the movie, and i'm not one to talk to movies period. everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen. my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even. the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding. the fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.

imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie. now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity. now imagine something 50 times worse.got that?ok, now go see the underground comedy movie. that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen. there were a few cheap laughs...very few. but it was lame. even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny.the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it. he wasted his money. vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's no surprise why.

a woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive.the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement.of course b-horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature.the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard.and the last twenty minutes of brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch.the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful.better watch "scalps" or "alien dead" again.of course i ain't expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray,but "haunting fear" is too dull to be enjoyable.

i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. and it was nice, but the movie is trash. i can handle b-grade, i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp (ie. 'surf nazis must die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. this movie has very little to offer.

fred olen ray is a lousy director, even as far as b movie directors go, but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films. yes, it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes, it is badly paced and uneven throughout, but it is also pretty entertaining. scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (jay richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by robert quarry). delia sheppard, a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress. you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic, robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes. the ending didn't make much sense!

first off...with names like fred olen ray, brinke stevens and jan-michael vincent, plus distributors like "rhino" and "troma" on the video box, you know what you're getting into with this one. b movie mania! if you're actually expecting to see a thriller "based on edgar allan poe," then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films. this is pure, unadulterated sleaze (with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to "the premature burial"), complete with lots of r-rated, ready-for-video sex and nudity. however, it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...brinke (who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife victoria monroe, whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father (hoke howell). her worthless husband terry (jay richardson) has racked up some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster played by robert quarry) and, with help from his kinky, blonde, european-accented sexpot secretary lisa (delia sheppard) plots to do away with brinke for her money. name-value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist (she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this), 50s sci-fi/horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living vicki. jan-michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home.the kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before, the ending is an unintentional laugh riot (concluding with a direct rip-off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit. brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role. she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here.

hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward.it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten. there's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops, and habits in a church tower like quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic).there's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything. she happens to look like his mother, yes so what? we know he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o.k. short film. now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change. he is a guy that stuff happens to. the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job.there's this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character. he paints his face, dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead badger on his head. a badger! you've got to see the ending! he returns to his home with the badger on his head (and it is shot like a tacky horror film) to kill his dad's new wife (which he had sex with in the beginning). and somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background. i've got to admit though, i'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. it feels like this mackenzie director/guy/whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school. you are so smart! thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! you really dug! what a wallraff! okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book, but anyway..photowise it is boring. a lot of talking heads. plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene, you know cold and warm etc.. why? maybe "hallam foe" is both a feature and a test film for color blind people. or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they increased blue so that we really get it.i'm not even gonna comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. and all the "cute" sex stuff going on. this whole film is an independent cliché. but i do recommend it. i laughed more than a few times. though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine.

in its way, mister foe (originally, and more appropriately, titled hallam foe  i can't see addressing its title character as "mister"), is a tribute to good acting. both jamie bell, as hallam, a physically attractive voyeur/creep, and sophia myles, as kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life. a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp. and a woman in kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police.these things are not, however, what happens in the movie. poor hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair. hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets he know it. she has sex with him. kate's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games. she looks like his birth mother. it all ends happily with hallam "resolving" his "issues".forty some years ago, the play and brilliantly acted movie, who's afraid of virginia woolf, had a similarly optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart. the trouble is, it doesn't always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. in virginia woolf, the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation. in mister foe, the emotional revelation never really happens.

david mackenzie's follow-up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel-good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho-sexual issues with his dead mother. it wants to be gritty, realistic, and mysterious. at the same time, it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult.to meet this end, the film tries hard to be youthful. its poster has hand-drawn letters looking like that of juno. its original soundtrack is comprised of fast-paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok; just a little misguided. but strangely the film is anything but youthful.like young adam this film's central mystery concerns a drowned woman- in this case hallam's mother. young adam keeps its mystery quiet, contemplative, and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come. hallam foe does the opposite. it foregrounds its character's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters. the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend. hallam swiftly interrupts, asserting his presence in the household. here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie.the mystery surrounding his mother's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father's girlfriend. the audience can never really trust hallam because, besides being creepy, we think his obsession has led him close to insanity. this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable. right when he's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home, at first it appearing to be looking for the police. then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother, which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element.while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character, he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs. this movie is in no way mysterious, yet it is not blunt either. it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues, but it adds a very self-conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite. it goes for a soundtrack-heavy, trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings, picks locks, and camps out for the sake of voyeurism. these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward-drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy, giddy, or pleasant. they are more neutral than anything; not propelling the character or story. mackenzie makes you understand hallam, yet he fails to build common ground.he expects you to enjoy hallam's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification. the film hinges on its audience's perspective on voyeurism/the kind of person who engages in it. obviously, most people would be disgusted by it. and hallam foe realizes that, but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions. he goes from person to person, trying to fill his deep void. there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam's love interest kate where she drunkenly says "i love creepy boys," perhaps asking the audience to do the same. the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him (her motivation remains vague throughout) and tries to further us from judging him. it's not hard to like hallam, but it is very hard to participate in his adventure- if it is even an adventure at all. all the while, the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood.great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act, muddy development, and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie. recently this film was re-named for a us release, and for what reason? not only is it more unappealing, but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title 'mister.'

i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee. but then, in poland in 2000, i watched it in a complete form. and so what? the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong, straight and fundamentally severe ladies. the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive, constant masculine desire for sex, feminists who are shown like complete idiots (you may agree with them or not, but idiots certainly they are not), and so on. the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like "i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her!". this was intended to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a vapid farce, full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos. do not waste your time on it - this is just bad.

once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing. i just recently reviewed baby face nelson. now i've seen dillinger and i've had it.this movie is garbage. i don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde. this movie is far from a classic. someone called it brilliant. that's an insane thing to say. this movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i've ever seen. i don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger. first of all he looks nothing like him. second of all, by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31. when oates made this he was 45! you could even tell that he's older than the real dillinger just by looking at him. not only was he too old, but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis.they show baby face nelson die, then homer van meter, and finally john dillinger. john dillinger was killed before both of them. the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson. not only do the writers not know when they died, but they also don't know how they died. baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe. homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns. homer van meter was cornered by the police in st. paul and gunned down with machine guns. another member of dillinger's gang, harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie. pierpont wasn't shot. harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair. i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i'm not going to go into it again here. let me also add that richard dreyfuss' portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic. there's a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating. while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming, "leave me alone!" baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought. maybe dillinger didn't agree with nelson's bank robbing methods, but they never fought. nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten. they keep calling him lester "baby face" nelson. he was never in his life known by that name. nelson's real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson. the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood, but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood. john milius doesn't know anything. where the hell did john milius get his information? i could probably make a better movie than him.finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable. the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette. by the way, billie frechette wasn't even there that night. but a girl named polly hamilton was. melvin purvis yells, 'johnny!' dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell. it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night. the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away. they didn't even have to shoot him. they were so close that powder burns were found on his face. it was murder. they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger. after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man? the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger's death. i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't john dillinger, but i'll stop here. if you would like to know more check it out heresee the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want, but don't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie.

i just finished reading a book about dillinger. this movie was horribly inaccurate. it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. his robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. they had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left. purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed, only photos of him. the way his gang members died were fictitious. dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. if i had never read the book, maybe i could have enjoyed the movie. the acting was a bit over the top in places. the action was overdone as well. on second thought, i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book.

proof why hollywood conventions are in place. stale dialogue, underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe. an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap-together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn 's bonnie and clyde (1967) and george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid (1969)- truly innovative filmmakers and films - but falling well below the bar. problems with storylines being self-explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections. the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically. unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor. stills, black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can't transition well or to replace scenes that just didn't work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid (1969).overly dramatic pauses between sentences, random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn't needed for storytelling plus over-the-top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980's - i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post-production. the playing of music in most two shots and close-ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score. no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots, doors, footsteps and dialogue (a style used in the late 60's through the mid-70's by new directors) but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads. in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no 'likeable' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story. neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the 'hero'- a necessity for any story to work for me. we know from penn's and hill's movies who the 'heroes' are. even though they are criminals, we like them and want to see them get away. i could care less who was on the screen in this film. i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non-historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger's life from june 1933 to july 1934 (his death).to be fair, there are some moments of good solid storytelling, which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits. john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn't seem to try to 'copy' other filmmakers. dillinger (1973) isn't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial 'big budget' debut, but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy.

near the beginning, after it's been established that outlaw john dillinger (warren oates), is an egomaniacal rapist, another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi. second-in-command melvin purvis (ben johnson), surveys the situations, sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded .45-caliber automatics, and stalks off into the distant house alone. bang, bang, bang. purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the female hostage, the miscreant dead. all in long shot.if you're enthralled by stories like red riding hood, this should have considerable appeal.oh, it's as exciting as it is mindless. pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically. multiple violations of the civic code. plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols. blood all over.as history, it stinks. few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero, partly, i would guess, because of his name. melvin purvis? we all remember j. edgar hoover, who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though.the picture was written and directed by john milius. he's the guy who had it written into his contract that, should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. milius is the guy, a compleat gun freak, who had teddy roosevelt's rough riders in the spanish-american war shouting quotations from henry v -- "saint crispin's day" and all that.exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "i knew i'd never take him alive, and i didn't try too hard neither." that is, kill 'em all and let god sort them out.you'll just love it.

anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, must have seen a film or two by american international pictures, a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films. wherever movie-goers ventured, aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead;' in the 60s were frankie avalon-annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers;' and into the 70s, aip churned out grindhouse-level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill.''dillinger,' released in 1973, is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven, over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned. on the whole, 'dillinger' is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, 'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director john milius ('magnum force') but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.the 109-minute 'dillinger' - epic for aip's scope - follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis, played by academy award winner ben johnson. purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice. at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout, including expert bankrobber john dillinger (warren oates), pretty boy floyd (steve kanaly), and psychopath baby face nelson (richard dreyfuss). dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson, taking along homer van meter (harry dean stanton) and harry pierpont (geoffrey lewis). he also hooked up with billie frechette (michelle phillips), a prostitute of french and indian extraction. while taking place over several months in 1933-4, 'dillinger' is basically a chase film, with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j. edgar hoover.'dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis. milius keeps an honest depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts. the film is never boring, moving at a quick, if haphazard, pace. the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint, edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort. thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film, not to mention pounds of explosives. this film is certainly not for the squeamish, with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place. the violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life.this film never transcends its exploitation status, however, because the needed writing just isn't there. john milius, somewhat overrated as a filmmaker, places way too much emphasis on action. the action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde.' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward. melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling. all too often, the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.aside from this, the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact. while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film, it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent. those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe. in fact, dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have billie frechette in tow. while these inaccuracies might make for high drama, there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing. oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the american press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime. ben johnson gives some life to purvis, suave but rather flat. michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger. we never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger. the supporting roles with kanaly, dreyfuss, stanton, lewis, and a briefly-appearing cloris leachman, are acceptable for such talent.as a piece of 1970s exploitation, 'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins, which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for $4.99. the film is nicely presented in widescreen (a must for drive-in flicks) with subtitles in french and spanish. dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra. largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts, the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material. for fans of the genre, it's certainly worth checking out.** out of 4roving reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr

i recently watched this film at the 30'th gothenburg film festival, and to be honest it was on of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to watch. don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g "manos  hands of fate") and then there are the awful bad films. (this one falls into the latter category). the cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between "one guy running around with a light bulb" and "non existing". the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la jason vorhees from "friday the 13'th". the plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse. i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep.

it's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. but the problem is that it's not very good. there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn't bother for any of them.rather bland (and sometimes downright bad) photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it. it's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high-budget films. but alas, that is what one must do. on its own, it's not very good. and compared to others, it's still not very good. but it is not without its good points! i liked the plot. it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end. sometimes in the really dark scenes, it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well.however in the end the film fails to impress. the characters are pretty much non-existent and we don't care for any of them. any of them might die, but it's possible to pinpoint the final "survivor" from very early on.

"i love new york" is another entry by vh-1 (mtv networks) showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill, obnoxious, woman. it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest, ebonics speaking, craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. many will argue, "this is a show". true, it's not as bad as it's previous show, "flavor of love" - but it's just as bad.it reminds me of a skit from the 90's show "in living color" where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on "the love connection" dating show and he picked "robin givens" for a date. mike talked of how the date was okay, but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in. this show reminds me of that.the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more - (i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv.) but these are professional reality actors, so why bother.it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this. the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (well, you can't hate them for trying to make a buck.) maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour? or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the wwf! any way you slice it, it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil.no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck, or any different from any of the others. appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an "end" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end, immediately.

the latest rumor going around is that vh1 is starting casting calls for i love new york 3 mid 2008. so does this mean budah or tailor made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the winner?i know flavor of love is coming up to it's 3rd season, so now with a flavor of love 3 and a i love new york 3.....will there ever be a true winner???i've also heard a few rumors that chance will be brought back for the 3rd season of i love new york!!!! i have also heard rumors that new york will be specially featured on flavor of love 3. hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of i love new york 2....i'm just stating the latest rumor.

i'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece. it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica, down to the porn-flic soundtrack. there was no look at what made dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. nothing but "look at how creepy this guy is." and i have to give the filmmakers this much -- their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen.

dahmer, a young confused man. dahmer, a confusing movie. granted, i had a few beers while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick.its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie. the inbetween stuff, which would be the movie, is just boring images and a waste of time. we never see actual murders, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer's dreaming the entire thing, but you know he isn't, since it'sbased on a true story and this actually happened, at least most of it. but what happened? it's not easy to tell.i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. ididn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended. */*****

i really felt cheated after seeing this picture. it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this. it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending. it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos. it ends suddenly, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie. there are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they got lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a dahmer 2. after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate. i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods. all of a sudden i hear this music playing, then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34. wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail. how about showing how he got there. how about showing dahmer's trial. how about showing some more detail. i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. i actually found myself saying in disbelief, "that's it, that's the end?" i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made. to the filmmakers i'd like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.

this was a truly bad film. the character "cole" played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped, the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil, it didn't. after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance, this would have added some sincerity.- 1) badly acted - 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) razor thin plot lineyuck!

the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used. if ms. pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer.otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies. as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value, which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get. perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to "de-commercialize" their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing....

saw in on tv late last night. yeah, i can hear what y'all say about this one. it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical tv soap series. in all fairness, the story line does have a fine twist to it, and you might nod saying, "well, that's not what i expected." but, as a film, well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element. casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. rated r?? oh, that scene. did we need it? this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched. and what was the title again?

this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian. we grow good wine. our writers and poets are among the world's best. the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. but we make bloody awful movies! this one isn't especially bad. it's especially typical and typically bad, shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction, high school level acting and "gee whiz...lets see what this button on the camera does??" photography. if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation, couldn't he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation? and if the movie was shot in vancouver, truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the "plot") why in god's name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle??? not only am i mad about this film, i'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed. the australians turn out some splendid stuff. we produce pretentious second rate piffle. gawd!!!!!

taped this late night movie when i was in grade 11, watched it on fast forward. i sugest you do the same. i though it would be and action film, but went to a cort tv type movie. in the end it fits in with the early 70's social activest type films. glad i missed that era. 2/10

once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h. beam piper who wrote a classic book named "little fuzzy" which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. mr. piper died in 1964, but hollywood and many of today's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold. this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from.skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of "little fuzzy" i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed?but don't take my word for it. here's a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of "little fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137

skullduggery is a strange, strange film based on the novel "ye shall know them" by vercors. to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind, since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity, and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance. but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone, skullduggery simply isn't a very good film. for me, the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how best to convey its message. the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk; later it teeters into sci-fi fable; by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics. the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great, too jarring, to overlook. they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you're watching a muddled, disorganised movie.an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple (burt reynolds). one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame (susan clark). after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creatures. these primitive, long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man. there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the "missing link" in the evolution of apes into humans. or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual? or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics? the archaeologists call the tribe "the tropi" and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery. but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen (paul hubschmid) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers. he questions whether the tropi are truly "human" and takes his argument to the courts, where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued.this was a very early film in reynolds' career, and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously. not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role, asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick. his character and the film are not relevant to each other. clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox, alexander knox and wilfrid hyde-white. a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance. rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids, the stuck-on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical. and that's just not the right idea. we're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures, but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing. skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant, philosophical and stimulating. the honourable intentions are there for all to see, but the end result doesn't do them justice. a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless.

the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine. all i can say is, it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. as far as i could tell, borgnine was the only actor in it. the other performances were so uniformly terrible, i am amazed a studio would actually pay the "performers" to appear. couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children, and to its credit, it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid-focused networks. but honestly, that is not saying much.

honestly, where can i begin! this was a low budget, horribly acted film, it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was! the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights, they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling!! me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there it was the sawtooth island movie. i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene.oh and the plot of the film, the story board, the script, etc..was a bunch of garbage that i don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it!! but if you happen to stumble upon this movie..do not get it!!!!!

over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids, i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy, direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through (for anyone over the age of eight). i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me "what did she say that for?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes. and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply "bringing realism" to a film, please run them through with a dull butter knife. "prehysteria!" was head and shoulders above this. arrgh.

you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies. this one comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). plus, every time i see mercedes mcnab (the sister) i keep thinking 'watch out! she's a vamp!"- for those that know buffy/angel.a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick, the little that was spent of course. i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money.i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity, but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it...umm...1/10 because that's the lowest it will go.

while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing, i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery. perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age: the movie was made, as it is now 2002, an official five years ago --after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings, and science fiction feats like star wars, as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer's the odyssey.my beef, basically, is that i couldn't relate --i am just about the same age of the children (a young adult), and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available. but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence. i didn't find myself saying 'ack! i would have done the same thing!'. it did not open the doors to my imagination. even without comparing it to high-budget films or other tv movies, standing alone, certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche: the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking, seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run. even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement: a typical set of one or the other stereotypes. there was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious, accompanied by mr. perfect image of combining athletics, good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude, and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days. while i know the personalities pushed the story along, i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable --and believable (as far as character)-- movie.i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design --that made it worth finishing to the end for me. don't get me wrong: all movies are worth seeing for yourself, and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many, but i think that with a little more depth to the script, and a little more (i cannot believe i am saying this) realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical.

the premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull.spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it. also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. there is no emotion in this film. the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. it was dull and boring.with some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good.

ok ...i watch a lot of bad movies. i pride myself on that fact. many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs. but this movie is one of the worst i have watched. i like a good horror movie...but one with a plot of and sense of movement. the opening scenes seemed pretty good. decent music and imagery. then it goes down hill from there. one of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret. they made that too much of a focus of the movie. so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been. no need to keep bringing it up. so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table. so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body. now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. well after seeing her sister over and over again (as a zombie like ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her. now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her. bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan. only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped. the idiot didn't even believe he killed her. so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun....somehow she manages to get herself strangled. so the last scenes of the movie are of the "spirits" of her and her twin walking out of the water. so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins. and not one but two innocent people die.good things about the movie: imagery bad things about the movie: music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors

i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. first, i'm going to say that it looks great. cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer. i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. i would not call this a horror movie. putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie. there's no mystery, there's no suspense, you know who did it the entire time. it's a drama. you know what's going on with both sides the entire movie. the acting was okay, i guess, but nothing special.and the tagline, "revenge can be deadly"....really?...they should have check how many hundreds of horror/thriller movies have that exact same tagline?it pains me to say some of this, but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie, and i know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass, so i give my honest opinion.

okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed? plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her? and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her "proof". i don't know i was not happy with the ending. this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad! do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy.

just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home. she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why.this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite. i can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better, or at least had gotten the little things right- like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size. i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong.

so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was just very little excitement. the acting was atrocious, to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes (the church lady for example). the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin, although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring. rather then get the police involved -- which i'm sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister. i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too, which the movie then fades to black. bad dialog, bad acting, bad ending.

this movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on. the dialog is flat, filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time. the choppy, shaky, film style is a cheap imitation of the "the ring" style visual effects. the characters do not even act like a normal person would. for example, the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door, creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home. what? you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her. way too many flashbacks to her childhood. too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director. it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around this corner, over here, over there, oh a side view, now a front view. enough already. you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris! terrible movie. 0 out of 100. i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it.

this was a movie about infidelity and revenge. a twin with the "twin" connection senses that something is wrong with her sister. this movie took forever to establish the plot. a plot that has been done many times. the acting was lousy for the most part. once the plot comes together, the movie ends. laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father. the father seems to favor ashley, so laura gets the blame for everything. there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry, a married man. of course no good can come of this. the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down. i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere, but it never happened.

for a film with so much promise it was disappointing, thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable.the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it's the worst clichéd ending i've seen in a movie for some time. the final scene would have ripped my heart out, if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with. i was numb! from the very first scene - one was left wondering, if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help, or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i've seen to date. it was a horror in the true sense of the word.

i'm kinda torn on dark angel. the film appears to be a "loving" tribute to the greatest pin-up to ever live - but there is so little actual "content" that the film itself is virtually pointless. i can't really see what the motivation or "point" of this film is - as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative - so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either...the film basically chronicles the last few years of bettie's career in bondage modeling. almost the entire film is comprised of "re-enactments" of some of bettie's more "famous" photo-shoots and loops. these re-enactments take up literally 75% of the films run-time, and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person. the film touches briefly on her short-lived legitimate acting pursuits, and her subsequent decision to leave the "business" and become religious - but all of this is pretty much glossed-over in favor of showing long and drawn-out re-enactment scenes...dark angel isn't a horrible film - there's just no substance to it. the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots - up-close it's a no-go. the other thing that irritated me, is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits. the film itself is obviously extremely low-budget, but does what it can set and costume-wise within it's limitations - so no gripes from me there. the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved. in fact - the most memorable thing about the whole film for me, was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaw's real name is dukey flyswatter. no joke - check the cast list. can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her. and if you are that bad off - then you need to seek treatment anyway...4/10

this movie was bad beyond belief. i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival. before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before, which happened to be its "world premiere." i don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. we all understood by the end. its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one. dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige, in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies. the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. a scene would start going then someone would say "wow you're so great bettie, why don't we make another movie." this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring than) the normal part of the movie. by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up. it was that ludicrous. i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre, but people were not laughing with the movie maker, they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure. this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory. i know movies are expensive. i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen. the movie looks like it was made for $12. the cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. this movie makes "dude, where's my car?" look like citizen kane. my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured. the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. apparently, the previous night, the night of the "world premiere" the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie. bettie paige's movies were destroyed. they should destroy this movie too.

the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie's story and re-creations of the klaw short films. while the klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. page richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. and, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie. also of note is some faithful attention to detail. costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. the sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. it is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.

they made me watch this in school and it was terrible. the movie is outdated. the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience.i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.this accounts for cheesy acting very often. also, very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched. i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them. though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, it ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched, and old. i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it.

in sixth grade, every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester. every class had something to do with this terrible show. we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters. in math we talked about charts and other sea crap. in science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so this wasn't a 100% waste of time). all day everyday was torture. not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well. i could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. i'm still trying to block this out.

i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one. but this film is static. never mind the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the pacing is deadly. admittedly these folks achieve much with little, but the film fails on the most fundamental level. it's boring. the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls. it should have been 65 minutes. the best thing about the dr. jekyll is mr. hyde who isn't seen nearly enough. he had the most dramatic potential. instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean-brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition. it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video.noble efforts by everyone in the production, but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice. instead it's just a lame retread.

it is so sad. even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake, there's nothing out there & . the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard. i like the brother and sister in this movie. they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like "my friends are going to be so jealous!" hey, whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning? thats retarded! i practically ignored the second half of this. my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe. the same exact sound for every chop!

as far as i can tell you, in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors, this film is currently available on dvd. i found it only a few weeks ago.it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it. i found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super-duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had??? i thought so.this film was indeed well worth 98 cents. 99 cents, i might start to argue with you. but clearly worth 98 cents. and remember that saying about getting what you pay for. for slasher film mavens only.

this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th. the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp. he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father, and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother (another f13th take off). the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims. then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods, soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son. later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute. he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on.this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80's slashers.

one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams, rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside, causing the material to wash downhill, where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries. the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields, where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. thus, the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner.first, we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor, a very rare treatment in 1938. a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors, with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. then, we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with olivia de havilland. among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. even the usually colorful gabby hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued. unfortunately, i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. it needed to be more like "the good earth", released just the year before. just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as errol flynn. finally, there is the matter of the inane title. surely, warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. "gold or grain" is short and to the point. incidentally, i understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills', waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.

as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie. but, what a disappointment! although the acting and the production values aren't bad, the script is awful, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is disturbing.the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women. has the writer been living under a rock? although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. it's terrible. it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after.

i went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. sadly, that's about all i got. the story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. the sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). worse still was the racism--the shrill jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.

by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing. you know the type....funny but supposed to frighten you.... this was not funny or horrific. the writing was lame...the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness....they were so expected. the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script...at least i hope that wasn't their best..watch this movie at your own risk......i give it negative 3 stars outta 10

pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. this is a horrible film in every way. imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. they would receive a d for this. college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school. since this monstrosity was made by "professionals" i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. i enjoy watching bad movies like "plan 9 from outer space" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. the script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life.

i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable. the plot was weak to say the least. i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up (i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs?). at least i didn't pay to rent it. the best part of the film is definitely dani behr, but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants.

must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time, but this one is up there with the worst of them. plot troubling to follow. sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film.i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two. sadly, in my case, i have the dvd. it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.

i have seen bad films but this took the p***. made no sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count. its that good. a welshman plays a sweary cockney. a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy, and some lesser lights play dim tarts.and there are some russian gangsters. oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.avoid this film like the plague.

we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie. a waste of time. the premise was not too bad. but one workable idea (interaction between real bussinessmen and russian mafia) is not followed by an intelligent script

...the first film i had to walk out on. and it was the cast and crew pre-screening (not that i was involved, i hasten to add). i made it through the first hour, so i reckon i'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit.like other comments here, how did this get through any kind of qa. an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue, the epitome of wooden acting, awful casting, all wrapped together without a plot.tara fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comic. she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history.as i left the screening, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. they obviously couldn't sit through it again either.

how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure? horrible script, annoyingly hectic camera, awfully edited, gruesomely badly acted. only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life. another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "dreck". why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand? do yourself a favour: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees. it's less painful and more fun than this movie!

just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film, i decided to write another review. i missed a few things out last time...first, the script. second, the acting. third, jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax!!!i can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something!are you getting the picture?

this is a truly abysmal `lock stock' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script. i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed. a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after 10 minutes. not the worst film ive ever seen, that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie' (i use the term loosely) `gummo' (i feel like suing that so called `director' for the lost hour and a half of my life) but this trash is nearly right down there with it. definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen. stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films.

i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. that has been done in great detail already, many times over. the 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles. anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen.i am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason i went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene. it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan's face in the bar in 'russia' (it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island). my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part. having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd, i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets. this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.

there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie. i never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince. fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian. when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. as the for the major problem....the plot....was there one? i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous. save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!

this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors, so what went wrong? i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film.....

words really can't describe how bad this film is. i thought zandalee was bad, but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. this is just laughable! terrible script, poor direction, awful acting and you know what? i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long. if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!). incidentally, i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. it is terrible!

this film is about a man's life going wrong. his business is failing, and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts.the plot is complete chaos. it simply does not make sense. in fact, nothing in the film makes sense. the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it. it is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. the shots are well composed throughout the film. however, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. it is such a waste of their talents. this film is very bad. avoid it!!

i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in russia. in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 dollars..you drink and talk", but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could, so i declined to take this speaking part on. i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "i'll be back" and "quite frankly my dear, i don't give a damn". had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski. as time goes on, i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.even though i spent a whole day on the set, in south wales hot-spot barry island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....still.....on the positive side....i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break. i had no idea who he was, as "notting hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be welsh. made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production........

in the wake of lock, stock and two smoking barrels, the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s-early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then. in one of the all-time great cases of pearls-from-swine, the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'the best film of the century' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because, at the time of writing, it was the only film that had been released in 2000. looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made, uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannia's lads mags brigade  rhys ifans, sadie frost, nick moran and joseph fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel. that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no-one really knows what it is, or perhaps simply don't think it matters. something to do with ifans' businessman being set up with steven berkoff's homicidal russian crime lord in a money-laundering or investment scheme (it's never clear which because no-one ever asks) by fiennes' crooked irish accountant, who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company. things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on, ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgerald's ludicrously accented russian temptress, berkoff keeps on saying "bizniss" and "francis drake" and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts.when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr, you know a film is in deep trouble. with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget, it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own, sitting there like a joke shop dog turd.

i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch. one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience. the best performances weren't anything to do with acting. in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary. do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash.

i usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films, but i can not believe this got past the script stage. the dialogue is appalling, the acting very dodgy, the accents just awful, and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best.i don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad. joseph fiennes, pretty as he is, might just have killed his career as quickly as it started.the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage.

i read james hawes book. it was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough. without having read the book i wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe. half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.never before or since as a film made me feel so angry. the mattress sequels came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james hawes without feeling angry. that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh*t. no, that's unfair. let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is rancid aluminium.plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema.

where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes? the over-the-top acting? the dreadful script?no. you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at. i know i do. i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags). however, cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product.i went three days after it opened with two other mates. the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.and that was on cheap night.either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.not since the days of the avengers (1998) have i felt so short changed since watching a movie. if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary.mind you, considering she used to be in the word, any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with.the production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious. if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say "fak!" for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.otherwise, bargepoles required.

this is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word " plot " is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such . there's something involving russian gangsters , a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant , and an irish bloke called sean . how they all fit into something called a " plot " i'm not sure . it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching . sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent . steven berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable . i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now i've mainly forgotten why . but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely

in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and "king arthur", on dvds chosen by others for an evening's "entertainment" and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination, and is content as long as they get "action". both movies were utter rubbish.whatever happened to character development? whatever happened to meaningful dialogue? whatever happened to acting? and, when watching something that vaguely purports to be "historical", whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of the "political map" of the time, even some slight flavour of the era, especially in its social attitudes. why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america? i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that "little was known" of the dark ages. not so. considerable amounts are known, with much learned scholarship on the era, but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework.i only wish i could vote 0/10

elizabeth ward gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (they have pills for that now!) is probably the weakest element of this show. it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.then you have the character of nick wolf. basically, your typical unshaven 90's hero, with the typical "sexual tension" storyline. (seriously, why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) this was a joint canadian/french production, so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york, and the other half is in paris... just like highlander did.

by far the worst movie of all time. even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey. i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "the treasure" but was changed to "sharks' treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "jaws". i think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. didn't work. anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? could they have made it any more obvious? the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. that's cause enough for celebration.

you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great. the premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey.the script is blasé'. the actors don't have much to work with. the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs. it's a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the movie has no budget.lack of budget is okay, if there's a story. "solarbabies" and "blood of champions" are examples of decent work from no $. but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich. again, forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck.finally, this movie commits the biggest crime of all: it doesn't finish! it simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. but the rest never comes. just odd.just bad.

there is a word for this sort of film, and that word is "drivel." it was drivel when it was a vhs rental, and it's drivel on satellite re-runs now.it might fool you, because it has 2 moderately well-known names in kistofferson and henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music, and nice monument valley scenery.it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot.if that's all you want from a movie, then maybe this will keep you happy.it's still drivel, though.

this movie will promote the improvement of the mind. read a book! it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make. i've seen "b" movies before but the "c" movie has just been invented. i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into "knights." high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume. embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. my roommate, who loves these types of movies even turned it off. now that has to really tell you something. if you watch this movie, and like it, i will pray for you.

i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran, so i didn't know who had done it at first. the longer i saw it, the more i started thinking, "jesus, this looks like an albert pyun flick." wasn't quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good (and the utah desert scenery was beautiful), and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon, a murderous cyborg, but with some style and a sense of humor. paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out, because albert pyun hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career. unfortunately, paulin doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone, and the movie's the worse for it. lance henriksen, playing the evil head cyborg, growls his way through his part, as he's done in countless other movies like this. i don't know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it. he goes through the movie looking (and sounding) like he just woke up, and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent. kathy long, the nominal hero, has a great body, is attractive, has a great body, fights extremely well, has a great body, and doesn't have an iota of acting talent, but that doesn't matter in a movie like this. this being an albert pyun film, it's full of the trademarks that we've all come to know and love: inane and idiotic dialog, choppy editing, and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured, "ah, nobody'll ever notice."as bad as this movie is, however, it's a shade above most of pyun's other efforts--this is "citizen kane" compared to his brain-numbing "adrenaline: feel the rush", for example. the fights are pretty well done, if repetitive (after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other, you find yourself saying, "alright already, go to something else"), and long is very athletic (and, as a previous poster has noted, has a great derrière). it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun's usual extravaganzas. you could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse, granted, but worse nonetheless.

in the ravaged wasteland of the future, mankind is terrorized by cyborgsrobots with human featuresthat have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. commanded by their vicious leader jōb (lance henriksen), the cyborgs prepare to overtake taos, a densely populated human outpost.only one force can stop jōb's death marchthe cyborg gabriel (kris kristofferson), who is programmed to destroy jōb and his army.in the ruins of a ransacked village, gabriel finds nea (kathy long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborgs ten years earlier. now she wants revenge. they strike a pact: gabriel will train nea how to fight the cyborgs and nea will lead gabriel to taos.five-time kick-boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high-speed adventure that delivers plenty of action. also stars gary daniels (as david) and scott paulin (as simon).

this is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that albert pyun made in 1993 - and it's the bad one. apparently all his energy went into "nemesis" which was an entertaining non-stop action movie, and had a much more expensive look. "knights" is clunky and cheesy, a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game (new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible). the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine. as for kris kristofferson, considering his age at the time (58), i hope his stunt double was well paid. (*1/2)

the first half of this movie is a pure delight. novel. funny. wonderful performances. a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman! adult. bright. witty. what more could you ask. as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing. it heads into unexplored territory. and then it falls apart.it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming-of-age coming-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times before. what a disappointment. as a people film it begins with such promise. why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian "i am who i am" film. the freeze-frame ending shot of heather graham's jumping in the air to celebrate "her happiness at finding herself" underlines the banality of the last part of the film.it could have been different. it could have been magical. it ended up being the same old same old.

this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year. you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are spoilers. gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin (heather graham and tom cavanagh). only gray and sam are brother and sister; living together in everyone else's eyes as man and wife. no sex but just about everything else. early on, the movie starts with its theme: 'the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions'. gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too. when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date. charlie (bridget moynahan) is the girl of their dreams, like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! that charlie accepts! in one week charlie, gray and sam are to be in vegas. in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns (apparently charlie has an off-the-rack figure). gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $10,000 frock for her. while charlie is zipping her in this 'down-payment-on-a-house' gown gray continues to slurp on the latte (i swear it was like a feed bag). what should happen but 'woops!' latte all over the gown. it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale's bridal salon with out a $10,000 mocha colored gown. back to 'reality'  caesar's palace las vegas. they have the 'high roller room' (sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money?) gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were, you guessed it - they kiss. gray remembers everything; charlie remembers nada. they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line "if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds" gray gets the hiccups. gray excuses herself, for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again 'hiccups'. gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets, literally. and of course one is you guessed it again! gay. the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver (alan cummings) named gordy. he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned. they become great friends. this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss. he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment. when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office. gray works at an ad agency. this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone. it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency. sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office. this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew: gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar. 'sorry no men' says the bouncer. so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag. bad drag. he was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse, a string of pearls, and a grandma's church hat. no lesbian would ever confuse this 'man in a dress' as a drag queen much less a woman. the bar was also the straight man's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is: full of victoria's secret models. everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firm's client. gray happens to be on the woman's account and finally does more then kiss. for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray, but that is for the sequel.

i wish i'd known more about this movie when i rented it. i'd put it in my queue on the basis of heather graham and her strong cred as an actress (imho). while parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. not to mention the ick factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... i don't care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. and charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other homo sapiens. what was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made gray fall for her? the story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. high points - molly shannon (although i do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion), the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences (if sam & gray were such great dancers, i wish we'd seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). could have been better.

i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end... having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom. what really horrifies me, i mean truly disturbs me, is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as 'delightful' or a 'must see.' i would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants.the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten. it is decidedly unfunny, poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold, canned rice pudding. to be kind to ms kramer, the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity, for having read the synopsis before i watched it, i had expected something more challenging. the possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co-dependence, the unexpected awakening of 'sisterly' sexuality, and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry (for the affections of the same girl) were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration, yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from.instead, the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations, with clichéd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction. the lack of directorial control seems astounding; on the one hand, moynahan, cavanagh and spacek all give very pedestrian performances, while heather graham and molly shannon - the latter in particular - veer towards embarrassing over-compensation at times. one could lay the blame for this on the director - maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over-act, they will force a bigger laugh from the audience. but then again, the cast is a veteran one; one would expect them to do better.sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make, and for whom. given the possible issues gray matters alludes to, and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy, perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead. i know it is never easy to make films about women and women's issues, especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone, but whatever direction she takes, inconsequential and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut mustard.

sam (thomas cavanagh) and gray (heather graham) are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things -- ballroom dancing, 1940s movie musicals and, much to their surprise, an attractive woman named charlie (bridget moynahan). historically heterosexual, gray is confused by her new feelings.gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen. it's dull, predictable, unfunny, poorly acted and poorly written. nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy. also, this isn't really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a "coming out" movie. sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part. unfortunately, she failed miserably. the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little. then, the film took an awkward tone and got all serious. the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony.i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic. the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn't really appear to be that close. their relationship just didn't feel very natural. also, the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural. if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week, then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are. there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters.the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast. heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie. she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it's too bad that all of her co-stars were complete duds. bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level. also, it seemed like she was reading her lines. thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion. the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony. i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying. sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them. finally, alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn't very good. overall, gray matters is a lame film and it isn't worth watching. rating 3/10

if there has ever been a worse comedy than 'gray matters' i am unaware of it. the new york jewish comedy's 'funny' premise is that siblings sam & gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix sam up with a girlfriend, only to find that gray is equally attracted to their target - charlie. the revelation that gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. there is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing 'drunk act' from moynahan and graham, and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from tom cavanagh. sissy spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume. molly shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance. only alan cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and given nothing with which to work. the whole disaster is cemented by graham's bizarre eye-rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. it is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs.

it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience, to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most. however, this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ). her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. this film might have been more, as there was suitable budget for settings, actors and a decent story line. my wife and i both agreed that this was 'muck' at the end, as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high! better luck next time, hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell.

please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you. damn cheek if you ask me. i waited for something to happen - it never did. i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through. i always have to see it through to the end. what a huge mistake. do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining. please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you. damn cheek if you ask me. i waited for something to happen - it never did. i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through. i always have to see it through to the end. what a huge mistake. do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining.

in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 backyard wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling dvd's. i have never witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and shoddy production quality found in splatter rampage wrestling. to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright misuse of the term. shot with low-dollar video cameras, it's essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards. the sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrendous. the "wrestlers" wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves. sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. sometimes on a back yard trampoline. all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. in short, don't bother with this stinker. whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.

the plot is so manipulative, counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision. the children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as i say, the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots, and therefore in that case, making more sense out of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust). why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore? how did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the last place to be searched? why would the 2 boys never be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched? there is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this. asking to believe it would then do to trial (even the informal setting) is too insulting to bare.

i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend how "great it was".now, i am pretty conservative in my views, but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it. i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses, and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist. but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and end.ok, the plot was solid: single president falls for a lobbyist. ok, this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining, since the plot was unique. but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial. the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney(annette bening).there were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a "closer". could she have been more flighty? she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything. hardly a "closer". i am an sales, and she could not "close" selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst.2) secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic? this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue. give me a break. i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible.3) the speech at the end was simply ludicrous. the line about "i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu" was a joke. first, no president would ever admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra fringe group. second, why even bring something like that up. you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative.i thought the plot was great and unique. i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president. but the movie went from being a "movie" to a left wing political statement, which is why the movie failed.its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience

if derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat... they don't really appeal to me, so i couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. it seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video. gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year? the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer. i don't think i was the only person in the cinema laughing. what i can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - filmfour and verve pictures. both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years. verve distributed bullet boy, code 46 and red road - straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. filmfour and verve take note: is this really the best you can do? what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? it's a big blot on both of your reputations. listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair?

*warning* contains many spoilers!let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress - which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script (or lack thereof.) the premise of the film was, in my opinion, a great idea and there were some genuinely thought-provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé. it exemplifies why i hate 99% of british cinema. it feels too long, it's tedious, for the most part, and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes. just when you think there's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon. with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot, there isn't much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn. as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees, with the average scene reading something along the lines of "alice: f*** off! (adam stares. adam runs off into woods)(alice follows) alice: adam! adam!" i suspect that, word for word, the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts. what few lines there were didn't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f-word that would make bridget jones's friend, shazza, proud. there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic 'oh that's terrible' reaction.alice isn't the kind of woman who courts sympathy either. she's got a great job, an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited, bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst. after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort-of explain why she is this way to start with; she grew up with a tough-as-old-boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so, instead of following in his footsteps, she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living. instead she found a group of stereotypical middle-class toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security/entertainment system (i.e. becoming mrs robinson to a wanna-be cockney wide-boy electrician) someone pass me a tissue. the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson. in the hands of a lesser actress she would've been intolerably one-dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being, most notably when she's sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault.i can't say that adam fared much better either. danny dyer played him well as a fish-out-of-water jack the lad but a good performance couldn't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background. this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end. as for the shock, the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become; it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes. on a side note, only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on - talk about stiff-upper-lip taken to the extreme! if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then i'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week. saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit, i didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion. i want that one-and-a-bit hours of my life back, please!

gillian anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun. after a stupid accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. after recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...i thought "straightheads" was terrible. violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. if i didn't dislike the phrase a great deal i would call "straightheads" a video nasty. certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's. frankly i don't know how "straightheads" got a cinema release.i am not a prude. i don't mind sex and violence in the movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterisation or c) preferably both. "straightheads" had neither. no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid. luckily "straightheads" went nowhere fast. it was only 80 minutes long.it was a shame, because there was the germ of an interesting film here, with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third. how often do i say this, but it could have been good if it had been done properly. what a shame. i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer, but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film. she, especially, is very underrated (and is still particularly fit).if you want to see a good british revenge movie, rent or buy shane meadows' "dead man's shoes". it is a little masterpiece. last weekend i should have seen his "this is england" instead. ce sera sera...

slow, boring, extremely repetitive. no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this. this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself, and quit producing. there is no way you can watch this and enjoy. the preacher is a joke. the whole idea is not funny. you can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature. i am so sorry i rented this movie. i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it. it is completely garbage. filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal. the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products, making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy.

i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of, and those i found made this one look unmissable. how misled i feel!firstly, it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie. the performances are wooden, every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are, and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men (particularly soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. the whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.if that sounds tolerable (or even enjoyable) to you, then be warned. linda hamilton's german accent, while quite good, is painfully distracting - as is her face, for some reason. the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day. there are few surprises, but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks!i wasn't expecting action, but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged. what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all.watch it under the folowing circumstances: 1: there's nothing else on. 2: you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' tv movies. 3: the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: you've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling.

goodnight, mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine. before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii. soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant, gruff old tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. in fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. aren't any new stories being written?as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.i found `goodnight, mister tom' cliched and obvious and john thaw's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one.

i have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'goodnight mister tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it. i have heard lots of positive remarks about this, so i had high hopes. once this film had finished, i was horrified.this film is not a good film at all. 'goodnight mister tom' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out. particularly, i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this. there was not much dialogue, it was rushed and far too fast-moving, but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down. the casting was not all that good,either. i thought this could have been really good, but it was so different to the book! anextremely poor adaption, one of the worst i've seen. this deserves a decent remake that'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage.

saw it at ucsb's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. i wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. i thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then i learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. while the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. seems as though "serious" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- nick and kate cops out and includes all three. please, be more original!oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. does anyone else thing so?

the director tries to be quentin tarantino, the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams, deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway, the late james coburn tries to be orson welles, michael rooker tries to be gene hackman, mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway (older version), cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), don't ask about joanna going. eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. it delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright. visit tulsa, don't watch this movie. it doesn't do the location justice.

i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie, either. it has some big names in the cast, but that's it. there is nothing else to recommend, save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films.the story involves nothing but unlikable, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that national film critics all seem to like....and most of the public can't stand. the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable, the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.

alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money i'llkick you were it counts and you'll have the same amount of fun. i'lleven guarantee more fun. this movie once again shows what happens whenyou can't get any one else to hire your family and your forced to makeyour own movies. same, i'm going through puberty humor jokes, justdumber and grosser. this movie is really a disgrace to movie goers. theytry to shock you into laughing because you can't believe the levels theyhave to stoop to make you laugh. so my offer above stands as

after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. though i guess not. if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs. it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.

having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive. the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising. alive did not deliver. very slow development. loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals. the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up. could have done so much more at the end. most of the movie is just " sitting around ". to put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end. it really needed more shock elements. if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment.

there are pretty landscape shots. writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths. with lesser actors this show would be silly. 'art must uplift humanity or it's bs.' not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. the lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side. wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes. there wasn't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain. all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes. the discussions between the characters was grade school, trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted. i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here. i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with. i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie. i was moved only once towards the end. the kid was way too passive. the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. just my opinion but nowhere show for me.

i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language, and corny one-liners. minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when employed properly. however, this film is not one of those cases.take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary, sparse scenery. i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight, because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. the acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end). the scenery is drab, and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. i would call this anticlimatic, but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the "erotic" scenes... it would be untrue. i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement. apart from two or three amusing moments, this film is a waste of two hours. a tragically boring and dreary film.

i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me. i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable. alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. however, these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive. the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film. unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going, before reaching fairly predictable places. the action is just about passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the earlier one about ok. the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work, making for less coherency. there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly. the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring. the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller. but the full length film is dull. only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans.

i enjoy a good, slow-moving drama. christmas in august, chungking express, virgin stripped bare by her bachelors, the way home, springtime in a small town, hana bi, eat drink man woman, dolls, in the mood for love, and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films  just to name a few. unfortunately, there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves. these are what i call ian films  "incomprehensible artistic nonsense." tsai ming-liang is the king of this subgenre, and vive l'amour is his "masterpiece." in fact, this is the crème de la crème of crap-infested garbage under the guise of "art." people walk around in their apartments, drink water, stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant, hang posters, staple papers together, go to the bathroom, eat, do pushups, have sex, slap at mosquitoes, etc. i'm not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film, which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art-house trash. there is no plot, no storyline, no interesting or noteworthy events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue, and most importantly  no drama.the most eventful scene has two people "banging" on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress  ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous. the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non-existent. tsai apparently didn't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to "bang." the person under the bed is just as one-dimensional and uninteresting. he likes to drink water, makeout with melons, and stroke himself. this is tsai's idea of "character development." a truly misguided "entertainer" indeed.tsai's true contribution in vive l'amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art-house film history. he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds, only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another 356 consecutive seconds. the film then abruptly ends. no point. no entertainment. just pure, concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer. in an effort to beat a dead horse. the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom. in fact, kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo. and guess what? it's actually interesting! that film moved as slow as molasses in january, but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive l'amour. kairo is a perfect example of that.fans of cinema may thank tsai ming-liang for directing this film, as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art-house cinema can be just as poorly made as b-grade, made-for-television horror flicks. art-house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self-righteousness. the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and  gasp!  showgirls. how do you like them apples?

need i say--its a stinker! (i gave it a rating of 2)only watch it if you suffer from insomnia.there's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up, but not much else happens in this movie. there is no suspense, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the heroine's well being. a few disagreements, slight raising of voices--that's pretty much it. the secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody - the last "secret" revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point.the plot, such as it is, revolves around a young woman named faith (meg tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very, very wealthy, older widowed woman, and a growing mother/daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her.it turns out the older woman's daughter, cassandra, is dead. you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together.even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two. why he's still hanging around years after cassandra's death is a good question.there's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything--cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. everything except apparently locking the door--since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is.there's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms, and leaning forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "mounting" tension in this film--just bland, pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time.

three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt jane stanton hitchcock's novel for the tube, yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to quit. struggling artist meg tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy, enigmatic ellen burstyn, who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. after learning about the last gathering held there--ellen's daughter's coming-out party--tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began, nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another! two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn't bear close scrutiny, one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity. burstyn's role teeters on camp, while tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy-eyed-waif routine. only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. the rest is piffle.

i've seen most of ryuhei kitamura's work and i've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action. scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts, gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage. with "versus" and "aragami" kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget. so what happened in "alive" ? to be more blunt, the answer would be - nothing. nothing happened in "alive" it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot.adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi "alive" is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro (played by hideo sasaki) a death row convict who survives his execution. he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments. he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it's host's humanity grants supernatural powers. naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro, the bad thing is that doesn't happen very soon. similar to "aragami", "alive" sets it's first half in establishing the basic exposition. characters are introduced, their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered. the whole thing even takes place in just one set. the first major problem of that comparison is that while "aragami" was just a 70 minute movie, "alive" drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long. that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case. dialogue is dry, monotonous, delivered without any sense of emotion or depth, characters themselves aren't much interesting. there were some small attempts at making "alive" a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic : evil government people against, super-powered protagonist, whom yes you guessed it, saves the girl in the end. like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set, and after two hours that does get boring, even worse the set design itself wasn't even interesting to begin with, and doesn't do much to improve on other aspects of the film.now, after that first part is over, one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning. sadly that is not the case. the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies, complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers. they're just not interesting or fun, kitamura's creativity from "versus" is gone, the small set even limits his often very impressive camera-work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights, a shame really.evidently "aragami" was better on all accounts and "kitamura" had learned something from "alive". so it wasn't at least a total loss watching this movie. if only to understand the errors made, how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie.

as interesting as a sheet of cardboard, this dispensable period piece has little going for it. it's overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real-life characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolution's fickle hand of justice. eric rohmer at 82? it shows.

you know what you are getting when you purchase a hallmark card. a sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. you get the same with a hallmark movie. here we get a ninety year old ernie borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. poor ernie, he is the poor soul that married ethel merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. in this flick, ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. we have seen it before. you might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned.

it's difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong, because i think the problem begins with the books themselves. alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories, but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist. he's done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan - not as successfully, but based in as much fact.once i realised this, it ceased to gall me that jill scott, an american singer/actress, is cast as mma ramotswe. if she is to represent a land that is not africa, how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african? she's not the only american on the cast; mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose. both women are far, far too young for the roles they're playing, and far too glamorous. both brutally murder the local accents, and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting. scott's mma ramotswe is bouncy, cute and soft. rose's mma makutsi is an annoying motor-mouthed bitch.the result is almost unwatchable. the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati, who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni. hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books, but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this - he's a shining light in an ocean of suckage. the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script.to me, mccall smith's writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad. he refuses to be edited. as a result, his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific, and characters that change name mid-sentence. it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse.the dialogue is now largely anglicised. characters speak of "opening up" and "sensitivity to needs". mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly. mma makutsi moans about not having a computer, but given her constantly restyled hair, makeup and jewellery, i'm surprised she doesn't have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card.so what are we left with here? it's difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly, most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway. mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute, non-threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom-nuggets. it reads well despite linguistic travesty, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were. it just isn't true.given that, it's hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does. it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice, however.

i had somewhat high hopes for this since i like tim roth. i was not pleased with this film. i liked the ang lee the hulk a few years back so i figured this would have more of a bang to it. first i was very disappointed with john hurt's performance here. he looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this. his performance was not convincing. he was not as good as one would expect. tim roth is cool as always here. the gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line i don't think. i guess the best part of the film was the end. it had some cool action. the only problem with the original was that it was too long. this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times. i remember some time ago when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and i always wondered why?. now i know. i was hoping to to get blown away, but i was not.

this reboot is like a processed mcdonald's meal compared to ang lee's very good but very underrated 2003 "the incredible hulk".ang lee's "the hulk" is a comic book movie for the thinking person. the hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core. he does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.now compare this to edward norton's turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). to this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in the phantom menace, which tell how strong the "force" is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. in the 2008 movie, all ed norton's bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. and for the record, it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.emotions drive eric bana's hulk. he has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. on the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed. but the hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. mostly, he just wants to get away or close to betty ross (jennifer connelly). he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.in the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. the action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.in his quest to turn it into a "fugitive" story, ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk. to him, the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry. and louis leterrier, the director picking up on ed norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the banner-hulk relationship. the story can be summed up as: banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt, banner is pursed and hulk kick butt. repeat as necessary.the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. however, even as i am a fan of the comics, i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.perhaps ang lee should have read more comics. iron man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart.

somebody owes ang lee an apology. actually, a lot of people do. and i'll start. i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and, wow....spoilers for ang lee's hulk and the incredible hulk was it boring! i almost didn't make it through ang lee's hulk. eric bana was expressionless, nick nolte was horrible, sam elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). in fact, i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non-angry state. when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.but then something happened. about 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare i say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of san francisco. this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. and i have to say, the cgi was quite good. that's not to say that the hulk was totally convincing. but it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. and that's quite a feat.of course, the ending got really stupid with bruce banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron man's brief heroics to shame. and overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. it was certainly better than i expected.ok, but what about the incredible hulk? guess what... it's boring too! it has just a few appearances by the hulk and here's the thing - the cgi in this movie is horrible. maybe the hulk in ang lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous. it had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. it was really preposterous. the lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than ang lee's, they looked 10 years older. and there really is no excuse for that. we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lee's "failure". all the same mistakes are made. bruce banner is practically emotionless. the general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk. the love interest is unconvincing (i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. the hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in ang lee's version. the incredible hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk. he's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. this is how i can definitively say ang lee's version was better: if i ever have the chance to see ang lee's version again, i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely i'd just fast forward to the good parts). but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience - at least in ang lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).it is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lee's hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. it is to edward norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.

'p' (or club-p) should really be called 'l' for lame. every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline: "thai lesbians fighting monsters." rather, this is the tale of a khmer country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd (but specific) rules: "don't walk under a clothesline," "don't eat raw meat," and "don't accept money for your powers." well, guess what folks, the girl moves to bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar-girl' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreign johns' who pay for her services.while this film can't even be released in thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most american audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between "showgirls" and "interview with the vampire" as directed by walt disney.if not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the mpaa could probably rate this for pre-teens only. there is literally broadcast tv adult fare, although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a thai porn star in real life.as for the 'lesbian' angle, there's one brief smooch and a couple of "i love you's" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple (on brother). and the p-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts (there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic imagery).no nudity, no real monster (unless you count a five foot high thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on dvd. you've been warned!

this was shown as part of the 59th edinburgh international festival, though for reasons best left to the powers that be. a lot seems to have been made of the fact that it's the first thai language film, made with thai actors & crew, but directed by a westerner. needn't have bothered to be honest, as this film is dull, dull, dull. why hint at something, why shroud an idea in mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs, obvious shots and over the top scenes> nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés. no hinting, no guessing, it's all up on screen, no need to use our imaginations. wonder when the 'scary' bit is coming? no you wont, 'cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating, rising to a crescendo of ominously. hell, i'm making up words to describe how bad this is. wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary? why tax yourself - it's really is a snake, and yes it's really is biting his crotch, and there's blood splattering everywhere. it's a strange, uneasy film for several reasons. it's supposed to be a horror film, but it's not scary - the jolts are signposted & obvious. it might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of thailand, yet the director has a sleazy, lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens. maybe it was casting himself as the virginity-taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head. or maybe the whole thing was just pants. uninspired, insipid, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for best description, but dull seems most appropriate and honest. it's all been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. sorry. thumbs down on every count. truly dire.

this has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century. it is all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below... everything. all the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.all the actors are below average, especially the main character anne fletcher (simmone mackinnon). there is a scene, where anne is asked: "why you seem so careless?" the correct answer is, because she can't act. no matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid grin in her face.it is not only the movie, which is b -quality. it is also the back cover description (at least in finland). the text mentions things like lorica gray -vessel, capital -vessel and main character garrison harper and anna (not anne) fletcher. the description sounds like a different movie, both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters

deep shock plays out like a tv movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature to be the "bad guy," and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.i checked out the movie because of the creature (i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos), and right off the bat, i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. the actors i expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). the music was typical, not-thought-out action symphonic music.i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. the movie even flowed really well, with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. but there isn't much of a story here anyways.this movie gets a 3/10 stars imo. the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming. chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video. don't bother.

utter dreck. i got to the 16 minute/27 second point, and gave up. i'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible (although 'pissible' is a more fitting word...). unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between dumb ol' dicky crenna and whats-her-face here is just non-existent. the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet? there's no ciggy-lighting-by-fingertip? and i thought i'd be sick when they have a mortified-looking (and rightly so, believe you me) lee j. cobb as keyes practically burping/upchucking his way through the explanation of his "little man" to mr. garloupis. no offence to the non-sighted, but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses. the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears. and crikey, how much $$ does neff make, that he lives overlooking a huge marina? this, folks, again, all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes. if you can get through more of it, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. but please, take some alka-seltzer first, or you will develop a "little man" of your own that may never go away. proceed with caution, obviously.

when someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. also, there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.well, the 1973 tv version of "double indemnity" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all. fred macmurray was great as the lecherous, leering insurance agent walter neff in the original; richard crenna just seems world-weary and tired. edward g. robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray's boss barton keys; lee j. cobb, a fine actor, appears almost bored with the proceedings. samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving, back-stabbing phyllis dietrichson; while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role, eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.robert webber, in the old richard gaines role as robinson's boss norton, and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness, bring some life to the movie. in particular, webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s context.however, after the movie starts, the whole thing just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. this is one film that never should have been remade.

this 1973 tv remake of the billy wilder classic is inferior to the original. surprise!first, the good things. lee j. cobb makes a terrific barton keyes. he's not as good as edward g. robinson, of course, but he's the only reason to watch this. this remake's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of lola dietrichson, the step-daughter of the femme fatale, phyllis dietrichson.and that's it for the good things.the bad things are many. the director records everything in an indifferent manner: if you watched the film with the sound muted you'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening. because of modern bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. because of 1970s bad taste, all the sets are distractingly ugly. walter neff's expensive apartment, in particular, is hideous.the modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways. train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so mr. dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance. men stopped wearing hats, which prevents walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white-haired mr. dietrichson. women in mourning stopped wearing veils, which robs samantha eggar of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene. (oddly, lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.)stephen bochco keeps much of the billy wilder-raymond chandler script the same. but he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular. outrageously, the famous motorcycle-cop banter is gone, but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. bochco may not be to blame.richard crenna is passable as walter neff. what might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid phyllis dietrichson. instead we get samantha eggar, who comes off like a standard-issue villainess from "barnaby jones." but who can blame eggar? with a director who barely seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well?

when samantha eggar (as phyllis dietrickson) answers the door of her house swathed in a towel, you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be, she doesn't have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck. and it is not entirely eggar's fault. in the original film, wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel, but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house. and she doesn't "come out"; she appears, almost as if by magic. walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor. there is a reason for this. stanwyck is much higher than neff (fred macmurray) when they are first introduced. it is not just the towel. the towel adds to the seductive allure. her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain, and, in a strange way, you feel as if, from the start, she is actually controlling the entire situation. she has sexual, even magic, power. this person is no ordinary housewife. this person is a mystery with secrets hidden within.back to 1973. the remake has crenna knock on the front door. stanwyck's stand-in, eggar, answers the door with a towel around her. there is no "appearance". she simply opens the door. the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973. she opens the door with a towel around her. it may be sexy in a charlie's angels sort of way, but it's not nearly as mysterious. the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilder's point. the script may have said "phyllis appears in towel" so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel. the point is not the towel. the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis, and the potential power she wields. wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique. the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that's what wilder did. and in the choice of shot, lost all of phyllis' mystique.richard crenna also seems miscast. he seems like he's "acting" and not really in the midst of the dilemma. part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70's actor. he can't get into the 1940's. when macmurray first speaks into the microphone, sweat begins to drip from his face. no sweat on crenna. and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning. in the original, neff says, "i didn't get the money, and i didn't get the woman." in the 1973 version, crenna says, "i didn't get the money, and i didn't want the woman." did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story? or were they dumbing it down for a "television" audience?this made-for-tv movie is a by-the-numbers rendition. all the sharp edge of the original is lost. the only stand-out, maybe, is lee j. cobb in the role made famous by edward g. robinson. but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original. this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tv-movie made probably by the same people who did "gilligan's island". they might as well have tried to remake "citizen kane" or "gone with the wind". if mediocrity is the best one can hope for, what's the point? the 1944 classic is a film with a capital "f". this made-for-tv remake deserves an "f" grade, or, maybe a "d" for dumb.

this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film, "double indemnity," is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script. this grade-b tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general. while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black-and-white films and sought disclaimers on wide-screen movies that are shown in pan-and-scan versions, the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake.the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script. the billy-wilder-raymond-chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time-slot with room for commercials. then update the production with bland, color photography, smart, upscale sets, and tv-familiar actors. thus, the brand-new "double indemnity" eliminates the atmospheric black-and-white film-noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original. gone are the dusty, shadowy, claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost. gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllis.the look of jack smight's take on "double indemnity" is more "dynasty" than film noir. phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for, and neff's comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman's salary, not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives. neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry $200,000. if not money, then perhaps murder for love or lust? not in this version. richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar, and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister. crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff, and his attempts at double-entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat. eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind. only lee j. cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes. director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better work.there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule. there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a double-disc package. the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting, lackluster direction, and tv grade production values. the 1973 "double indemnity" should be titled "10% indemnity," because viewing it only underscores the 100% perfection of the original movie.

bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for $2. i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one.the movie is quite cliche "1970's" and is quite groovy for that. unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie. in fact, i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was.the movie has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait.......for them.if you are into b movies, this might just be for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens, and did i mention not much story line either...

i noticed with some amusement that in the end credits, the detroit pd is thanked for their participation. the chief of police even has one speaking line playing himself (and boy, can you tell he can't act). the reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. not the kind of pr, i would think a police force would want. other than that, this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the '70's with a racial angle. alex rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that can't get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife. he makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse. hari rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. the movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense (why do people that are only guilty of a robbery, take on a whole police force?). not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four. then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was. seeing that director arthur marks was also behind the braindead "friday foster" and "bucktown", i shouldn't have wondered.

you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? well i had a similar sensation while watching this film. okay, i did actually choose to go and see aprile, and i knew about nanni moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps. caro diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. in aprile, however, moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something i thought was reserved for losers like me. surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. by making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. and when he started fawning over his newborn baby, i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. the next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism.

...however i am not one of them. caro diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess. moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but doesn't want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really doesn't want to either. a film about italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film. at one point, moretti and his friends are standing outside the communist party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside, but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them. interposed with moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come. i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a nanni moretti movie again. he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.

before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team, he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies, many of which were parodies of major hollywood features. following a dispute with anderson, laurel continued the informal series of parodies at joe rock's smaller (and more indigent) production company.most of laurel's parody films were only mildly funny at the time, and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is parodying. 'west of hot dog' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot-'em-ups. it's marginally a specific parody of 'west of the pecos', an oater released two years earlier with no major actors. since 'west of the pecos' was never a huge success, it's difficult to see why stan's film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery, much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it. and where did they get that title 'west of hot dog'? possibly it's down to the fact that 'hot dog!' was a sexual interjection favoured by american lechers in the 1920s. (as in the opening scene of the stage play 'machinal'.) 'west of hot dog' was produced and co-directed by joe rock. among his many other achievements, rock introduced laurel to lois neilson, and he was subsequently best man at their wedding. full disclosure: in the last years of his life, i had the great privilege of befriending joe rock and interviewing him. nearly ninety years old at the time, rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he remembered nothing at all about 'west of hot dog', and i can't blame him. this movie is eminently forgettable.the leading lady's character is named little mustard: if that's meant to be a parody of something in 'west of the pecos', i don't get it. there are a couple of 'impossible' gags here, including laurel's method for mounting a horse. for just one moment in this movie, stan laurel reminded me of the great buster keaton when he suddenly broke into a run. 'west of hot dog' is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to keaton's short comedy 'the frozen north', but keaton's version is much funnier. the plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in keaton's feature 'our hospitality' but (again) suffers by comparison: here, two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the last chance saloon, but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot stan. however, the brothers will become the legal heirs if stan dies. hmmm...seriously, though: is such a bequest legal? as soon as stan takes possession of the property, surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision, not the previous owner's decision. i had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy.at one point, a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock. it looks cheap and isn't funny.this 'hot dog' is no weiner, and no winner: it's just a whiner. my rating: one point out of 10. hang on, stan: in a few more years you'll be one-half of a comedy legend.

back in the day, i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me! i was not estatic, but curious... i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck. my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy (i'm actually gay), so i decided to watch the show with low expectations.what a horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! first off, i hate the new characters. tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff, it's sad. i also hate how they made chef kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. bad move, 4kids tv! escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede (who sucks big time in this show) and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby. so stupid, i hate this show.i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity. kirby'll never beat mario in the fight for coolness, and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness. nuf said!!!

this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy-mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow; the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.

getting lost in space frozen for 15 years, that's unlikely. falling into a star... improbable. falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes... ludicrous. getting rescued by a ship just then... priceless.no, it's not zaphod beeblebrox's heart of gold to the rescue. it's also not the parent of the year awardees. after sentencing her daughter to two years' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship, the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they've picked up. this foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat, which makes up most of the film's action. combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away, who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.in the end, the family of three abandons the metropolis-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave, instead using the psycho's fighter ship which they've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile. you have to love those hard sci-fi statistics! as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel.

a pretty average scifi film. the plot was more or less obvious from the start. although the acting was reasonably good, the writing seemed very cliched, using ideas taken from numerous films.the basic plot: scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting. onboard they find a stasis pod, which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment. after 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up, you realise that he is a complete lunatic. something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship...after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims, overall i think speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter, which i didn't consider to be a good film either.not a good film, get aliens out and watch that again.

on a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk. he releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship. they dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star. this massive craft is populated by only three people, presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors. anyway, to cut a long story short, the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies.the psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying. 'annoying' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic - unhinged, frightening, dangerous maybe but not 'annoying' but he is. the three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city! considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man-made craft could exist, never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task. despite the vast size of the spaceship, the crew all have appallingly kitted out, tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. but there are a lot of corridors.the film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci-fi thriller. but nothing great.

despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly. the script makes little sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and john lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. his performance is one-note and irritating.the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn. his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.

i saw this on dvd ( it`s known as corrupt in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitel`s character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in " this gritty and powerful police thriller " . what the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old italian movie . how old is it theo ? well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the cd player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . you see my point about this being an old film ? the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . it`s also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones . with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( i don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy dvd or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is ennio morricone`s score . it`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns.all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments . it`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards

encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film. bad mistake. i've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film. the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is harvey keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. one for keitel obsessives only.

i thought harvey keitel, a young, fresh from the sex pistols john lydon, then as a bonus, the music by ennio morricone. i expected an old-school, edgy, italian cop thriller that was made in america. istead, i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: wtf!!! too many unanswered questions, and not enough action. the result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet. keitel and lydon work well together, so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script. oh, and the morricone score: ok, but not memorable.overall, not a waste of time, but not a "must see", unless you are a hardcore keitel fan.

tom brown's schooldays aspect ratio: 1.78:1sound format: stereoin late 19th century england, young tom brown (alex pettyfer) is sent to the public school at rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (stephen fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, flashman (joseph beattie).already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably gordon parry's superior 1951 version - thomas hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter ashley pharoah (tv's "where the heart is") and director david moore (the forsyte saga). it's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions', and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to hollywood and beyond. otherwise, this is typical uk tv fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this. the uk publication 'radio times' described it as "daintily odd" and raised a querulous eyebrow over "all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys". quite.

this tear-teaser, written by steve martin himself, is so unbelievably bad, it makes you sick to your stomach!the plot is pathetic, the acting awful, and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending.avoid at all costs!

this film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, silas marner by george eliot.the details of the film shown on imdb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but i did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying "suggested by the book silas marner". suggested? it was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:a wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. it is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.in this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. in only one can i find a difference. silas marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far. on top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! there is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. this is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!i am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. if i was a trustee of george eliot's i would insist on reparation. if i was steve martin i would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. at the very least it should be entitled silas marner - adapted by s martin. or better still removed from the archives!if you are interested in this story - and i hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch silas marner. or read the book! the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's.

there is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different ... and end up being mediocre. i was thinking about jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to steve martin.this movie is reasonably well acted and directed, but the script is a stinker. martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in "roxanne", but this effort to bring a victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility. if you want to see an old story updated with some style, best to rent "great expectations".

just got back from a free screening and i'm very glad i didn't pay to see this very sub-par film. the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults. it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick and fart jokes though (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). the movie is pretty juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and mostly annoying. the characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.visually, the film is about average with nothing that really stands out. they did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from wallace and gromit, but other than that it's very forgettable imagery.although i was really bored throughout the whole film, i chuckled a couple times. it's not an absolute failure, but i most definitely would not want to watch it again. if you're a parent with kids (and you don't care that your kids see mindless cheap-jokes) then feel free to take them to see it, but everyone else shouldn't waste their money.

a few months ago, i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster (hey, kmadden) about this film. the poster insisted that if i gave 'flushed away' a chance, i would like it. based partially on that argument, i agreed to watch the film.'flushed away' has good intentions (at least on aardman's part), but lacks the strength to pull it all together. its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain, rita (played by kate winselt), who, imo, should have been the movie's main character instead of roddy (hugh jackman). rita's cool, tough, and interesting, while roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.one of the things that bothered me most about 'fa' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with. when roddy gets hit in the crouch, the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately. "my name's shocky," says one of rita's brothers, who then electrocutes roddy at least three times. my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low.i won't waste time griping about katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar (one similar film's a coincidence, five's a rip off.), but i will say i'm disappointed in aardman. they can do (and have done) so much better. try harder next time, guys.

i wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute "borat" tonight, and left quite disappointed. i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit, and routinely go to see animated films. that being said, i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out, but stayed waiting for this film to get better. never happened.the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of kate winslet and ian mckellen (i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto). the problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the add-set. it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another, weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an "important message." it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category, and considering the way it's scoring with critics, i wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware. but if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for ratatouille.

ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.he plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! the cool part about this movie is the slugs. they do all the sound effects. they sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. ok bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. i didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like wallace and gromit. i thinkthey slacked a little on that. the movie was just decent, not worth spending $9.50 for though, sorry.

the story behind this movie is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pacing, action sequences, stunts, and use of cg all cheapen and spoil the film.first off, action sequences. they are all quite unexciting. most consist of someone standing up and getting shot, making no attempt to run, fight, dodge, or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. the sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.the cg features very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.pacing: everything happens too quickly. for example, "elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start can do back-flips, etc. why is she so acrobatic? none of this is explained in the movie. as lilith, she wouldn't have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she couldn't, since she had wings.also, we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car, and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car (and then felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car)... "are you okay?" asks the driver "yes, i'm fine" she says, bloodied and disheveled.i watched it all, though, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting... but in the end, the poor execution made me wish for anything else: blade, vampire hunter d, even that movie with vampires where jackie chan was comic relief, because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but this just made me want to shake the director awake, and give the writer a good talking to.

a good idea, badly implemented. while that could summarize 99% of the scifi channel's movies, it really applies here. i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and i like action movies, and i like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. however, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to bill platt's bad writing and directing.another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. this movie doesn't. it's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words "second draft" are not in bill platt's vocabulary. there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "plot" up front. it also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what *is* that?).if you are a fan of shiri appleby, watch this movie because she's ok. she does manage to break out of her "roswell" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing q back in st:tng, so that's nothing new.in all, i gave this movie a 4/10 rating.

in my lit. class we've just finished the book, hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) brian never ate worms in the book. (2) he didn't know the pilot's name. (3) his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) the man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) a thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch. and for the acting, the kid who played brian was a horrible actor. however, i do believe that the scenery was impressive, though i highly doubt the director even read the book.this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet, by gary paulsen, but if you have, then begin a complaint letter to the director.

i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear ad.the film begins with brian (jared rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a rubik's cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it. once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by ned beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue.here is where the main problem with the movie begins. by the very nature of brian's solitude, jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. as a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension. these scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story. even worse, occasionally jared  his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `predator.' speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night.another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. for instance, we are never shown how they react to news of brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on. this is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey.

this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking. jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie, thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie. the film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair. unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). furthermore, despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded.all in all, a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to, much less innocent kids.

i wish i could give this movie a zero. cheesy effects and acting. the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. lets start with the kid who plays brian. what a geek! i couldn't believe the mullet! then there was the talking to himself. i guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent, but still. of course they had to have him skinny-dipping too, not something i wanted to see. but jared gave a great performance, compared to the special effects department. everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself, and better. i seriously doubt that gary paulsen had anything to do with the production, seeing as the movie was not even called hatchet. finally, i do not think the writer had ever read the book, seeing as nothing was the same. i think the book was great, but this movie stunk like a smelly goat!

- bad stuff: this movie is real crap. bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake i thought this was "the twilight zone". the flashbacks are pretty much useless. one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better. i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting, even from the adults was horrid. a kissing scene in this movie even sucked. this movie killed the book. the book was great. i highly do not recommend this movie. not even for educational purposes. - good stuff: i don't know what i can say really. there is some suspense parts that get you going, but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting. - my verdict: do not watch.

i had never read gary paulsen's novel, hatchet, for which 'a cry in the wild' is the adaptation of, so i can't make any comparisons to the book. i will, however, say that as a film on its own, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.think of 'a cry in the wild' as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer (was quincy, california the only place this was filmed?) version of 'cast away.' jared rushton is 13-year-old brian roebson, a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father, until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain, leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.there are basically three parts to the film. the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters, namely brian and his mom. the next third of the movie (which really consumes nearly all of the film) is that of brian "roughing it." these scenes contain no particularly amazing action, nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape. nothing to put you on edge, no real encounters (except a brisk confrontation with a cub), and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first, primitive means, and then more improved ones (using tools, etc) for his survival. it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation, and that is pretty much about it. in other words, they put no meat on the paulsen's words when they translated them into a visual media.and, of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue.there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time, however. some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. however, for the most part, it is only explained in brief, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video. any minute, the singer from jefferson starship, should chime in an start singing 'sara.' other than what the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters, whether or not it really had anything to do with brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie. these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and, for me, almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more! it certainly was not, for me, a good adventure tale. but, for fans of jared rushton, it was one of the last few movies he made. so, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.

after seeing only half of the film in school back in november, today, i saw that it was on flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.the book that the film is based on, hatchet, is ok. this is a terrible adaption of it though.awful (and i mean awful) acting, bad dialogue, and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of hatchet.the film starts off brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen (sporting a mullet, banging his head to cheap 80s rock music) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged dad (his parents are divorced...now cue the dramatic pause.) now brian has said goodbye to mom and dog and is flying up to see his father. the pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man (wasn't like that in the book) who after 2 minutes in the air, has a heart attack and dies. in the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack.the plane (within another two minutes) has gone empty on fuel (leaving us, the viewers, to assume that he's been up there for hours even though the sun hasn't changed position and the scenery looks exactly the same.) now's he's crashed landed.this is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book. in the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips (looks like he just bought it), it never said he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf, and fell asleep up there on the mountain, it never said he was attacked by a bear (it said a moose but not a bear), it never said he eats the several bugs that he does, it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows, skin them, and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes (that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes) nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes.i don't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado. all it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things.my favorite part of this camp fest was brian's lame flashbacks (that are never mentioned in the book) especially the cliché scene of brian waking up, walking over to the window and seeing his dad (with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck) leaving and screams "daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddd!!!!" (yet of course his father didn't hear him even though he was just right outside) and he punches his fist through the window (wtf?) the ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (i said close.) in the book i think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to brian when he landed was "you're the kid who they've been looking for! they stopped months ago..." yet they left that line out in the movie.there's a pathetic epilogue with brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) getting back to normal with his family. i think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) then it shows his temporary home (for what, in the movie, seemed like three days, but in the book was for several months) and his hatchet, still in a tree where he left it (also didn't happen in the book) showing where he carved a message, so perfectly done: "home" (where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet?) no quote can sum this movie up better then when enid from ghost world said "this is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again." perfect description of this movie.i wouldn't recommend it to somebody (who hasn't read the book) and are just looking to watch a movie nor would i to somebody who has read the book (because they'll be disappointed and bored to death.for those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as the movie. this is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book.1/10

another big star cast, another glamour's set, another reputed director, another flick filled with songs that's topping the chart buster, but alas what's missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture. so much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before it's' red carpet premiere. a hype which went to an extent where anil kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge. well anilji, which movie were you speaking of? well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people, who have a total different stance towards life, but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem, that's love. well indeed a luring theme. but little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a multistarrer movie. these are kinda movies which i totally abhor because after spending a hefty buck for a multiplex ticket i get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax.the trouble begins right from the start. the director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets baffled as to how to share the time slot to six different star casts. some of the couples like anil kapoor-juhi and sohail khan-(whoever the female is opposite to him) just doesn't make any sense for their existence in the movie. salman (who calls himself rahul in a weird manner for the entire movie. well something like rahoooooool) again as usual tries to be extra cool with his videsi kinda hindi accent. hey sallu bhai, now that aish is getting married, at least go get some tip from abhishek to improve your acting abilities. a simple striptease wouldn't make the movie a box office hit every time. and anilji stop shaving your trade mark beard or you look totally like a eunuch. and smooching a girl of your daughters' age just looks as uncool as watching jack nicholson in a romantic movie. and please nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot.the other bigger flaw in the movie was that there wasn't any perfect synchronization between the stories of different couples. every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks, put together to form a sadistic plot of salaam-e-ishq. bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like snatch, memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline.somewhere while i was evaluating the pre-release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie wouldn't do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28, and 28 is considered a bad number in numerology. but i totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not coz of its numerology defects, but because of the myriads of flaw that persisted in the movie. and when director like nikhil advani can make such major blunders in the entire storyline of the movie, any wonder wouldn't have saved the movie from bombing at the box office.my suggestion for all you guys is, please avoid watching this movie at any cost. it isn't worth a pie that you pay for the ticket. there indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than salaam-e-ishq.

i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in november! it looked awesome and the songs! i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it! this is a film which weaves 6 couples together. it has a multi cast of 12 people! a huge amount of stars have worked on this film. i think the director, nikhil advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him. compared to nikhil's directorial debut 'kal ho naa ho' , 'salaam-e-ishq' falls quite behind. i think nikhil should have a smaller star cast. i think the best factors of this film is the songs! the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome, shankar-ehsaan-loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years. i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! one thing i was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by sohail khan and isha koppikar. i found this extremely rude watching this with family! although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents! i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall, i think its an alright movie!

i have been waiting for this movie a long time. especially because juhi chawla is in this, she's a great actress.this movie contains six stories. it's a new concept flew over from hollywood. so it's not a new item.1. khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her. but then rahul (salman khan) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend.priyanka chopra is still not a good actress. when she yells, i get annoyed. salman khan cannot play comic roles. but in his serious parts he is marvelous.2. vinay (anil kapoor) is married to seema (juhi chawla). he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman, with forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and kids.anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors / actresses. they are great. but this story is to thin for them.3. shiven (akshaye khanna) is going to get married to gia (ayesha takia), but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off.4. ashutosh (joh abraham) is married to tehzeeb (vidya balan). she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore.5. raju (govinda) is a cab driver. he meets stephani (shannon esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman. raju has to bring staphani to that man, but falls in love with her.i never liked govinda's movies. he is very annoying, not funny. but in this movie i liked him very much, like he has been growing up the last years.6. oh yes! there is sohail khan! he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati (isha koppikar). he want to get some serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between.sohail khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! i like his movies.now here's the problem. all these stories aren't interesting. to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! here and there the stories touch each other, but is not significant for the characters.my conclusion; priyanka cannot act! loose that woman in the bollywood industry. sohail khan should make more movies, this role for him was too small. salman khan cannot act comic roles, but real serious movies. that's written on his life as an actor. this movie sucks, and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor, juhi chawla, akshaya khanna and john abraham.it's just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan, and you only let him sing a lullaby.

this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see. it is painfully long and awfully directed. i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end. run time is way over 3 hrs which could have been edited to less then 2 hrs.transition between stories is average. most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come out.its funny only in pockets. ambitious project and a below par execution. govinda does a fair job, anil kapoor disappointed me, rest we as expected. if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close.

i've seen all kinds of "hamlet"s. kenneth branagh's was most ambitious, mel gibson's was quick and to the point, laurence olivier's was the best - hands down. but now we come to maximilian schell's take on the bard.for one, this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeare's venerable chestnut. but if there's a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade school-level. having seen it on mst3k helps, with mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white tv, shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an ingmar bergman reject.of course, the best parts are the mst riffs. best lines? "i'm gonna unleash the great dane", "i don't think so, 'breather'", "meet the beatles", "hey, dad, will you help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, during a party - "garrison keillor's leaving germany (yaaay!!)".but then there's schell, playing shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would, only not as expressive. no doubt he's a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in "the silver chalice". ever see that one? you gotta watch these two on a double-bill!in the end, this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book. at least the book isn't dubbed by ricardo montalban.one star only for this "hamlet"; ten stars, naturally, for the mst3k version.good-night, not-so-sweet prince.

i read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it. i'm a big francophile and art film lover, but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something "arty" or "intellectual" into something it is not. i will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never, ever wanted to actually see. obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. the film is, in essence, disgusting. i mean, when i saw requiem for a dream, i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film.

townies is the laziest movie i have ever seen, and i saw the blair witch movies (parts one and two). it seems confused in what it wants to be. it's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough for watching. it has scenes of a man doing "slapstick/bloody" karate so i think, oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash. then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicap) woman and a trusting mother. then it slaps itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks. the part i'm speaking of is a lonely townie who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse. that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling. the rest was a waist of my life. then, just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne (the director) making fun of toby (the star) in public. it made me sick. even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd (two other movies by wayne) aren't the best, they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits. i even like killer nerd a bit, it had some great lines i still use to this day.if you like underground films, if you like overground films, and if you like to watch your feet, just resting were they are, you will not like townies!*1/2 (out of ****)

the strange people living in a town go about their lives. there's the licker a guy who licks everything, a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways...offbeat in the extreme, this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color. the monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel. like a troma movie, this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time-not always- but enough for it not to be fun.(though i didn't see the cleansing coming). worth a shot if you've nothing else to watch and you're waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix.

first, a little summary. this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him. nice message, government censorship and all that, but the way they did the movie was, well let me explain.this movie is beyond description. the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution. the script is atrocious on its own, like it was written by a sixth grader.as for special effects, i understand that independent films have low budgets, and some gore effects looked acceptable, but if you want a scene with fire, here's a tip: buy some nonflammable material, have an extinguisher ready, and get a fire going! don't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game. the acting, well let's put it this way. in my summer theater program, a cold reading of the script is, compared to this, the godfather. i won't even go into the inconsistencies. find them yourself.what disturbed me the most, though, was when everything was finished after shooting and editing, somebody might have said, "okay, this looks good. let's release it." it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it, to think somebody felt that this was good enough for dvd release. this isn't dvd quality. this isn't sci-fi channel quality. hell, this isn't even film school quality. if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school, you would get an f. no, not even an f, more like an f-. i wouldn't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled.i felt used after i saw this thing. blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now, and i'd prefer not to think of what they're doing with it. i have been the pawn of some elaborate, nefarious scheme at legalized theft, and it doesn't feel good to think that i walked right into it, looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 days later only to find a film ed wood would watch and say afterwards, "i didn't much care for this." this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen. i have not seen anything by ed wood, but i have confidence this is worse. if you are looking for serious cinema, so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache. if not, i still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night. however, if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out. you won't be disappointed.

although nothing can compare to vampires vs. zombies...in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie.firstly, the special effects were breath-taking. when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me. simply stunning my friends.but the scene when the jack black sound-a-like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself, but don't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on "i must be high". seriously, he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non-congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be "high" to justify his awful acting. well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors you will probably get the same response...seriously.with a production team called "shock-o-rama" i was shocked i didn't place a sawed-off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played.if you want to see this movie, then you should be murdered yours truly,the general

as you may have gathered from the title, i wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time. the acting, camera-work, writing, special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked. people have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script. wow. the plot has more holes than i or anyone else could possibly count. for starters, why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe? i know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country. there wouldn't be anyone to govern! another thing that i was wondering about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies? were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? and how about the ending? that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies. he probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. and another thing, why does he say hindenburg before he dies. the hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people. the zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world. he doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots? they also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer. why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? especially when the zombie could have come through the door. it's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand. every day i pray that god with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in feeding the masses.anywho, i think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production. hey trent haaga, i'm calling you out!

this apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking; but feeding the masses comes off lame as some of the stiff-legged zombies stalking the streets. in rhode island, a zombie epidemic known as the lazarus virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations. a couple of brave, but dumb, souls at channel 5 tv news feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand. an eager reporter(racheal morris)and her cameraman(william garberina), with the aid of a military escort(patrick cohen), risk life and limb to present a 'live' broadcast to show the doom at hand. do yourself a favor and don't watch. this thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad. acting is atrocious and the flesh-hungry zombies are almost comical. also appearing are: michael propster, william decoff and brenda hogan. feeding the masses should be left to starve.

this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see. terrible, terrible, terrible. any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. how does this film suck? let us count the ways...the plot? incoherent. dialogue? atrocious. i will not slam the effects/gore, as i understand that this is low budget. but was there even one zombie that was not obese? c'mon! and for a film set in rhode island, why did that truck sport a massachusetts plate? continuity, find some.the girl dancing while the soldier "stands at attention". please, don't put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people, and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover. next time you decide to make a movie, don't.

honestly, who in god's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating?? i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. otherwise this movie sucks! this movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. i'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen. the props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. i'm all for bad language in movies, but the f-bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f-bomb in any movie ever. the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a dvd.do not buy this movie. do not rent this movie. all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. this is valuable time that you will never get back. unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. if you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.

set in providence, rhode island, feeding the masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government. at best, it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war, but it ends up feeling hollow. there's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good. worst, the direction of the movie is atrocious, focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond "isn't this an odd way to hold the camera." special effects are pretty bad...at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city, and it's laughable at best.the film does have a couple bright spots...namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a reclamation service and a party bus). but it's far too little to make the film worthwhile.for a better zombie film, try hide and creep. it has the same weak production value, but there's much more wit, humor and talent behind it.

feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. suggestion? keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old theatrex took one for the team on this one. guess what the plots about? zombies taking over. this time though, for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in rhode island, and to be honest i'm not sure i've ever seen a zombie flick based in rhode island. a tv station, controlled by the government, is supposedly keeping up "normal" broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world, that is, those that never look or go outside, anyway. i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. there is actually somewhat of a story to this but i'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep. at any rate, this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the "seen it all before" stuff that gets trotted out before the camera. trust me, you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this. 3 out of 10.

don't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot. i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re: death on the nile. everyone has done this one! we know who dies. we know why they die. we know who the killer is. we know how it was done. so i say enough already! mr. suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels. i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. the sets were terrific and very realistic. i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. somehow i don't think so. i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms. christie wrote it that way. i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison!

as low budget indies go, you will usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say, i didn't pay much for "frightworld"...writer / director: david r. williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer. not a bad premise, but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes. the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it's audience, by constantly using shaky quick-cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. this becomes evident right off the bat, as we are introduced to the would-be killer, and soon realize that the (acting) is the scariest thing happening... after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times, yet the acting remains the same. "frightworld" does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun-house, but with an extremely long running time, it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell.there is some mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies.fans of really bad b-movies might find something of interest here, otherwise, don't spend a lot of cash.

very bad. very, very bad. as a fellow who aspires to make, be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set, i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made. however, this movie ... oh dear.realizing frightworld doesn't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake. and to be fair, it is more entertaining than - say - red zone cuba ... but not by much. so i won't try to critique, just let me ask throw out some observations.1) if gore is the point of the movie, shouldn't you be able to see it?2) if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment.3) in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll. difficult i know but really...4) there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo/rochester area, most you can hire really cheap. get one who knows how to frame a scene.5) just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds.6) kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time, get girls who's tops we want to see taken off.7) editing should help tell the story or set a mood. at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags. a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary, it's sloppy.some good things. not all the acting was bad. jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back. there was some neat imagery, unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason. "acid poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. i like the moxie of frightworld too. next time, now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts, i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis. upgrade at least ed wood.

this was a weird movie. it started out pretty good. a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.next comes his "down fall" here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy "b" movie. poor acting , i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? these guys could not. after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts...from this point on it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes.that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake off.i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse.

an italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?well, based on the uneventful, extremely tedious, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, i would have said 'very easily'; thankfully, however, things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).the hoff stars as gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie (leslie cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; whilst there, frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity.his plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks (robert champagne and annie ross), their pregnant daughter jane (blair), son tommy (michael manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland), and estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.after explaining their unexpected presence on the island, gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (hildegard knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. one by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs), before meeting a terrible fate.none of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (manchester as tommy is particularly bad, whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; jerry is crucified and burnt alive; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and gary gets stabbed in the back.oh, and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed (again).

this movie is so bad it's good -- in an unintentionally funny way. i couldn't stop watching it, i was laughing so much! it's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. alexandra paul plays emily wendell, an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for luke (corey sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; the only thing sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! mind you, he's no worse than the other actors. you get the sense that the actors have *no* idea they're in a really awful film; they're playing it straight. everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music. the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church, then luke's final words to emily -- i was howling with laughter. evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get to see plenty of his naked torso. that's probably the highlight of the film.

i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while. the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way. the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey savier's impressive abs. alexandra paul (i think that's her name) is horrendous as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. ted mckenzie is gross and his character's a twit on top of it all. and as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son isn't enough, they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity! the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable. i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him!

i am watching this movie right now on wtn because that was the channel that the tv was turned to when i turned it on. it is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister's wife (alexandra paul) falling in lust with a young stud/drifter (with washboard abs) played by corey sevier. there may or may not be a plot. corey whips his shirt off a lot and alexandra swoons. i'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good, and that's why he's messing with skinny alexandra paul. it's not really important because as i said he takes his shirt off a lot and i just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage. there's a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful.

this film is a pure failure. i am a steve martin fan, but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script. think "police academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. yuck.i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received (and rightfully deserved!). it is extremely misleading. i have often seen this film marked down to $3.00 in the grocery store and now i certainly know why.if only i could get my 90 minutes back...

when i say " doctor who " you might conjure up an image of tom baker , or jon pertwee or maybe peter davison . when i say " james bond " you`ll almost certainly conjure up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan . but when i say " sgt bilko " absolutely everyone will think of phil silvers . unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor . and that`s the problem with this film version you`ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show . in fact the whole idea of making a film version of bilko without silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage

even steve martin and dan aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg. based on the classic phil silvers tv series, it bombed because: a) it was updated to the 1990s, and b) the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing, feeble and silly screenplay.the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks. to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble, and it shows. no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time.

this was a disappointing movie. considering the material---army life is always good for a laugh---and the stars, this movie should have been a fall down laughfest. it was worth a couple of chuckles, at best. steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles, where he might follow robin williams' lead and someday win an oscar.

della myers (kim basinger) is an upper-class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband kenneth (craig sheffer). della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting kenneth. on the christmas eve, she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts, and she does not find any parking space available. when she sees an old car parked on two spots, she leaves a message to the owner calling him "selfish jerk". when the mall closes, della's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  chuckie (lukas haas), the afro-american huey (jamie starr), the chinese-american vingh (leonard wu) and the latin tomás (luis chávez). when the security guard of the mall protects her, he is shot on the head by chuckie, della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals. however she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang. she takes the toolbox and hides in the wood, fighting against the gang to survive.a couple of days ago, i saw the trailer of "while she was out" and i was anxious to watch the dvd. unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés. della myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family. she is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the batman's utility belt. therefore, the plot is so absurd that irritates. the gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of american movies, with an afro-american, a chinese-american and a latin together with an american lord to be politically correct. kim basinger has a decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five year-old woman. my vote is four.title (brazil): "enquanto ela está fora" ("while she was out")

steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy. he absolutely does not fit this part. like the woeful remake of the out of towners, this movie falls flat on it's face. how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie. dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better. martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work. it's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over. the line "the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army" was just about the only line that actually made me laugh. if you want to see the real bilko, get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show. those are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho. none of them should ever have happened.

i know i've already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify something...i'm not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b/w picture of phil silvers, jackie gleason etc.bilko was already 20 years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil silver's bilko courtesy of bbc2. i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve martin's travesty if i hadn't seen or heard of phil silvers - i don't know - maybe i would have.some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they haven't seen the original. i can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. if after watching the original ernie, colonel hall, ritzig & emma, duane doberman, henshaw, dino, flashman, zimmerman, mullin et al you still think that steve martin's film is woth anything above a '2' - i'll stand you a pint....

for 50 years after world war 2 the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. at the same time, because of the draft and wars, everyone in society had served, or was connected to someone who had.this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. sometimes that machine was non-us military, for example in prisoner of war situations. once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always reference this military genre, and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling.you can trace it, i think, perhaps starting in the comic, meaning amrican, sections of "the great escape," which immediately spawned teevee offspring in "gomer pyle" and "hogan's heros." then a second wave triggered by "catch 22" and "mash," both of which had been real life, then books, then movies, and in the mash case, then teevee.but before all that, there was the "phil silvers show," about a sergeant bilko and this followed from "mister roberts." a happy con man, who only committed harmless crimes, and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life. this was in the day when teevee shows mattered. you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about. it wasn't particularly clever in any way, except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable, even endearing lies in a military context, a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here.because its big, it sometimes pays off in laughs. "stripes" was pretty darn funny i thought. it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes, sort of folding in some "dirty dozen." and sexual adventure.now this, well before the cultural wars escalated. it tries to touch that sweet spot, like other remakes that manhandled steve martin. it is so unfunny, you actually root for the army to be the stronger player. yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power.ted's evaluation -- 1 of 3: you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made, but it certainly was far from his best. obviously, he did this crap for the pay check. dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man. what he doesn't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie, they expect to be entertained, not bored to tears. it's sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him. i don't understand why talented people can't get a grip on the fact that people don't want to see them in lousy movies. if you're going to call a movie a comedy, then it should be funny. this wasn't. shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum, too. full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy." surely, phil silvers is rolling over in his grave.

maybe i'm really getting old, but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely. surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman (that's me, schultz!). lordy, lordy what i would give to see the light! firstly, that phil silvers manic energy, wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life, if you will. although it is possible that the series, first titled: "you'll never get rich" (1955-59*) could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt. bilko, it is very hard to picture any other actor/comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant's stripes.such a strong identification is inescapable, though not the same sort of career-wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys, like clayton more("the lone ranger"), george reeves ("the adventures of superman") and charles nelson riley ("uncle croc's block").one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's movie-going public is our collective memory. without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals, and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times. it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart.so as not to be thought of as a totally square, old grouch please let's consider some other points.right here today, the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007, let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years, furthermore, i've enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko '96 co-stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman. after all, it was the talents of guys like this and so many others, alumni of "nbc;s saturday night" and "second city tv" that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing. but a bilko re-make; it just didn't click.perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy (always liked 'em!) but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby, old guys like me.so, we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately, what's next? howse about somebody doing hal roach's world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday & ames and tv's 1st cartoon series "crusader rabbit"? remember where you heard it first! poodle schnitz!

ok i'm not an american, but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not, never has been, and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction. phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man, no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced. how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me. to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin's unfunny attempt to be peter seller's inspector clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career. some of your contributers say 'steve martin puts his own stamp on the character', to that i would say 'balderdash' , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come

director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past, like 'greedy' and 'clue'. this isn't one of them. more akin to a 'police academy' film than its inspiration, it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors. but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act. nothing much happens, really. it's all quite dull. it's not very funny. martin, dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort, but they're all better than this and it's quite painful watching them work with such thin material.

i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen. slow,badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing! mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless. they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea. the plot is dull!! i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one!! if you avoid one film this year....let it be

i absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on. its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. what happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.

i feel like i've just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing! a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse, abuse. no redemption whatsoever. and i was entertained. i couldn't stop watching. what does this say about me, about the people who make and act in this sort of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. and i'm neither puritanical nor humorless, i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness, and i definitely have not led a sheltered life, but i am ashamed of myself. and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. it doesn't have to be cozy, but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism?

it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this "movie." no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing. she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career. this is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.the fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of logic.**after she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her. tell me, what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? i don't mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back. but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level. no woman would do that unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them. none of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged. and by the way, when the security guard approached, as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger, why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream?? **when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes. she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. i understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should've ran.(i didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because i loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on it).**why would she carry a loud, red toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? when she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox. first she resists, then eventually opens it. and takes out a wrench. this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie. when asked to open the box, she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch/push/open/manipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical/shoot him in the face/render him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all along. it feels like that's what they tried to do with kim basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugs.**throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackers.**when she was running away, how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were? i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude. she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from them.**finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her. how ridiculous. as one of the thugs even said, they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate. even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?

no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. as a bbc licence payer, after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment. i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines. these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas!paul bentley, west yorkshire, england.

seeing as i hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed, i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. downright terrible. and not, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. i thought i might agree with him, seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved, but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said. i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie "definitely lacks good-looking females." let me be the first to say, "wow! that was definitely some serious in-depth reviewing there. my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie." seriously though, a lack of "good-looking females" shouldn't be considered an essential to a movie. if you're desperate enough for "good-looking females" you should really watch other types of movies, not necessarily falling into the sci-fi category.

as seems to be the general gist of these comments, the film has some stunning animation (i watched it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth.firstly the characters are all pretty dull. i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito, toola and the main antagonist shunack. however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (laputa being my favourite animé, original engilsh dub). the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected (she loves agito, who seems oblivious of this). however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more "happy". there is also a serious lack of explanation. like who are the druids really? are they people? and who are the weird women/girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest? there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers. the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this. it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffids.and who does call toola? why bother with this if it wont be explained?i really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki. i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadn't bought it. my advice? give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap! perhaps if your new to animé films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it. it certainly is visually pleasing.

as many agree, origin is a beautiful anime artistically. the music, graphics, and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works. however, if you are looking for more than this, than i suggest looking else where. the beauty stops short of its appearance, and when it really comes down to plot and characters, there's nothing special. action is slow and minimal and the people are flat, corny at times, and do not act realistically. not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there... so, in summary, oh my goodness, i've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness, it's like... -poke- people don't act like that. it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there's not even that much action to make up for that...

this was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half-hour before this. dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america's funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three. tawny kitaen must've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes. it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house. that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie. coulier must've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating.

i remember that show. i still remember that kick ass fun song "america's funniest people." frankly it should've been titled american's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people. dave couldn't save this show and neither could bob saget or the replacement hosts for afv that came later. the jackalope segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than bob's. but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted. also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the olson twins. plus afv was in it's prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner. did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame? but still the theme song rocks!

a woman (sylvia kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (eric brown). they have sex...but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something.easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? i suppose it's ok cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. sorry, but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it. it's still sick. i realize brown was of age (he was actually 18 when this was made) but he looks 15. i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok.plot aside the acting sucks (kristel is beautiful--but can't act; brown is easily one of the worst child actors i've ever seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic.i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981. i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass for 18). he wanted to see it--i didn't but i decided what the heck? we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! let me make this clear--three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity! that should give you an idea of how bad this is. i'm surprised this was ever released. a 1 all the way.

a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad. what?!?!?! the movie glorifies child molestation. oh, but sylvia kristel was naked in it, so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars. why not a full 10? because the filmography was "agonizing," the child's looks of shock were "unrealistic," and the fat friend was "irritating." nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman. i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime. to me, even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar, i would still have to give the movie only 1 star. that tv's howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous. but don't take my word for it!

oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace.i am not usually this critical about any movie, cause every person has his/her style. but this movie, however, was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and i think it should stay like this, for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke.i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay far away from this one.

well, it turned out as i expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! the 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense (hell, does anyone understand that word these days?). in this burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!), but what's wrong?first, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of hollywood-human traits. i refer especially to ari and the slave-trader. these traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions. it makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.second, the humans talk. of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that dr. zira has in him (so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since capt. davidson has to play the hollywood-let's-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. oh my god, will they never learn? i new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! they were in need of a hero! and then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! but it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape-hater like charlton heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society, where heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. the second, battle-part comes as an anti-climax. that's because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot. nice try, but the chill you feel when davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.fifth: the ending!!! for chrissakes, who came up with that?! (a) davidson crashes twice with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? come on, who'd believe that? if the pods are really small space crafts (davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? and what about that ending???? i mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. but here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (there's a thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? how come? did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before davidson's mission took off? why is thade worshiped? stupid stupid stupid.helena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but i'd expected no less. i preferred her ape above estella warren as a human, but maybe i got some loose wire in my head. nevertheless, the only convincing apes were tim roth as thade (wonderful!) and ari's household ape (the ex-general, but i forgot his name).nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. it was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. don't stylize everything...

i really looked forward to see planet of the apes, but it was a huge dissapointment.the settings and masks are great, but that is the only good aspect of the film. all other things are really annoying. mark wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. the other actors are also not very good.but the worst point of all, is the story. it is absolutely ridiculous! for example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! this is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.

what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. they would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth, his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.and alas, the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. and the "haha, we're so clever, aren't we?" way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one. sigh...instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'ed wood', 'edward scissorhands', 'batman', or even to a lesser extent 'sleepy hollow', and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.

i had very low expectations for this alleged "re-imagining" of the original -- and they weren't even met! what were they thinking? (answer: they weren't.) please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest. clip your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything besides watch this. remember: if you rent stuff like this, it will only ensure they make more.

this tim burton remake of the original "planet of the apes" from 1968 (and starring charleton heston) is a far, far cry from the quality and plot of the original.certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. the characters were boring and the dialog was awful. i sat through the entire film with a friend (who thankfully only rented it) and completely understood why, before christmas, all of the "planet of the apes" toys at target were in the clearance bin.my advice to tim burton: don't put this on your resume.my advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 "planet of the apes" movie.

being a big fan of the "other" planet of the apes films, i rented this dvd despite my aversion to all things tim burton. once again, he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. even the ape makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. mark wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if boogie nights wasn't proof enough). i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter. no doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche-ridden screenplay. i rented this dvd on a special $1 night and i still feel ripped off.

i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. for one thing, it was directed by tim burton. another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. i found it boring, gross, and ridiculous. if you've seen it, you know what i mean. just about everyone at imdb say it's crap and boy, are they right! if you haven't, avoid it. it's a snorer. 1 out of 10.

this is the worst movie i have seen for years! it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. i thnik when is something going to happen in this film,,,, and the the acting is worse. the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop. mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks.

while watching this piece of crap! the day after, i saw a 1min trailer - that one minute included all, all what was at least not boring to watch...so don't waste money or time on this one, get the original, it's much better though the effects might not be up to date...

this movie was 100% boring, i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater. it wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either, it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie, god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that

this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen! watch part 1 and two, but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first two! i mean, really, you don't make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! i mean, it would have been ok if this wan't a "home alone" movie, but they did make it a home alone movie. culkin is too old now, so you're suppose to stop making sequels! goodness, this movie makes me sick! buy part 1 and 2.

i like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. you can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of chris columbous.this movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting. i cant even believe these people are considered actors.painful to sit through and watch. the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself! the movie wasn't even set during christmas like the original. home alone was turned from an excellent christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot!

in 1987, john hughes wrote and directed 'planes, trains and automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy  the best thing he's ever done. ten years on he's reduced to again recycling the plot of 'home alone' in this second sequel, which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic. the four crooks  that's right, four! and one of them is a girl! congratulations, hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than culkin. you'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from fossilising the same old routines, but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for 'home alone 4'.

alex d. linz replaces macaulay culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the home alone empire. four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car. because of baggage confusion, grouchy mrs. hess (marian seldes) gets the car. she gives it to her neighbor, alex (linz), just before the spies turn up. the spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. home alone with the chicken pox, alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress, but the spies always manage to elude the police while alex is accused of making prank calls. the spies finally turn their attentions toward alex, unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby-trap his entire house. home alone 3 wasn't horrible, but probably shouldn't have been made, you can't just replace macauley culkin, joe pesci, or daniel stern. home alone 3 had some funny parts, but i don't like when characters are changed in a movie series, view at own risk.

the first home alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting. this one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. the new score is quite bad(though the new "setting traps" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. it (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. the plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it's still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. the acting is mostly unimpressive. the characters are mostly caricatures. the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). the fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that isn't the first time in the series). it's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. i could follow it, but i doubt a kid could. some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. the animal stuff is generally not amusing. there are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. all in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. i recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 3/10

'home alone 3' is the first of the home alone movies not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villains. however, the plot is very similar to the original 'home alone' film. instead of two comical villains, we get three or four of them. this film involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car. the slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (no pun intended.) this film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. it's more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. i would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring. if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy, then watch the original 'home alone' movie.

beating the bad guys... again is the tag line for this movie, it exposes so much truth about it.home alone one and two, film classics. home alone three and four, a good film if you're three! like sharkboy and lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be funny, it's not. culkin is replaced by alex d'linz or something else. he's a very bland actor with bland performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions. the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks, and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real. a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day. and to make things worst, a totally different cast, go see if you don't believe me, but you'll regret it.

the first "home alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90's. the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes! now comes "home alone 3". i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would've been 17 by 1997. he could take care of himself, right? so, what does the director decide to do? he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots? i don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie. but please, i'd recommend that you'd stay away from it. it's not worth your precious time. go fold a piece of paper, do chores, balance a pencil on your nose, or take a nap! it's better to do then to watch "home alone 3"!1/10

this is a bit of a first for me, the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film. pota isn't a bad film (great sets, costumes and the odd great performance) but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director. the pacing was very odd, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end, by myself and the cast. tim roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. come back tim.

this is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, pointless piece of trash i've ever seen, an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. if you think that ed wood's "plan 9" is bad, well... let me tell you, looks like "citizen kane" compared to that one. ¿special effects?...again, "plan 9" is "star wars". ¿acting?...thor johnson is al pacino... so it's beyond bad, really. but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies, it's for you! i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies, the price-corman-poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with "star creatures" they descend right down to the z level. of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy... if you can.

some things need to be clarified. the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie. i know that because he was my dad. please remove that picture. also, mark ferris was the writer, at least one of them. i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy, that would be great. the movie wasn't all that bad, and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fi's it futile. if you watch it, just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses. lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films.

invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the "so bad it's good" category if the film wasn't quite so sexist or racist. that it is such just makes it plain bad.it has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in queen of outer space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this instance, native americans) that you would normally find in thirties & forties b-westerns. in terms of being non-funny, the same walking-through-the-cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie. ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney (but can't make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row, nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it). there really aren't any production values to speak of, as the "star creatures" make the ro-man from robot monster or tor johnson in plan 9 from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magic.this film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema...not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all-night drive-in.

- let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s. i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously. the problem i have is that none of it works. a parody should be funny and this one just isn't. not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile. in general, i am easily entertained, but i couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures.- i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning. the two "stars" make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet. these two come off as bowery boys wannabes. why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me. after the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits. it's all just a complete waste of time.- i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls. that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures.

gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes.i love 50 sci fi, i even love cheesy 50s sci fi, but this film is really, really bad. and not in a mst3k kinda way.virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best "hip cat" impression of abott & costello.chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi, such as in "cat women on the moon" but it can't in this case. this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature.that said, i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so.

this was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970's, usually on the "4am movie" or one time, on the 7:30 pm "channel 6 big movie" and still another on creature double feature.when local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time) it was of the time. a couple of low-rent abbott and costello wannabees(frankie ray and robert ball) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in army surplus remainders) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation, and wind up encountering extraterrestrials. they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous batcave on batman, and encounter the remains of a dead "carrot monster". later, in the cave they're chased by a living carrot creature-basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head, with sparkly things on it and ping-pong ball eyes. two of them-complete geeks,ray and ball-are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being "examined" by space amazons-dr poona(nooo kidding!) and professor tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini "uniforms". we were too young at the time,to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this "examination" scene would more than suggest. turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster, are stranded on earth with a ship that's well hidden and are trying to return to their world.the film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when eric von zipper and his crew from frankie and annette's films, were the height of b-film, drive-in comedy.so it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks.for some reason i only thought i'd imagined seeing this film to start with. no, i really saw it. and when it was released on "restored" dvd i was assured in my memory. the comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid, but whatever.the budget is non-existent, which, is a minor miracle when you think about it, that it even got made and we can talk about a "restored" version here and now-over 40 years later. the payoff is the girls who want to learn about "love" and "kissing" and, the upshot is the geeks-which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out. it's just goofy and silly and for the locations, has nostalgic significance.

i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film, but this is too much. in the end they look like a bunch of loonies. this film is one of those finding yourself 70's plots, i know the film is made in 1980. a lot more of clint and girl friend movie. this movie is a 3/10.

sondra locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her. but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. it's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good eastwood. there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. wow! could a film be any more boring? i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. a real stinker. don't bother with this one.

clint eastwood is bronco billy, the leader of a wild west troupe, one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling-to-break-even touring show. the seventh member of the bunch is a woman, billy's assistant, but such women never last long, and the position is chronically open. enter antoinette lilly (sandra locke  eastwood's girlfriend at the time). it seems miss lilly, as doc (scatman crothers) calls her, is a would-be heiress who will only receive her long-deceased father's estate if she's married by the time she turns 30, so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish geoffrey lewis.so, what's the plot of this film? it's hard to say. there's the romantic tension between billy and miss lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she's so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes 'one of the troupe' halfway through the film, it's not only unbelievable, but the audience is well past caring about her. there's the chronic lack of funds behind the wild west show, but this topic isn't touched upon enough to really be the raison d'etre of the film. there's miss lilly's predicament of being stranded in the rural west, cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury (she's mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press). but are we really supposed to believe that she couldn't get back to new york and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort?no, the point of this film seems to be that billy is the leader of a family, a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin. this is a warm, fuzzy film  or at least tries to be. along the way, clint shows us his skills with a gun, even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non-violent film. one of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge; billy bribes the local sheriff. the show's tent burns down; an orphanage makes them a new one. but numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make.compounding the problem is the acting, or lack thereof. aside from scatman crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateurish. eastwood isn't on top of his game either, though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch.and for all this, the film plods on for 116 minutes. to what point? good question  4 out of 10

absolutely the worst film yet by burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film. this is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out "he's lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everybody know. carter is really awful and so is wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing. very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman. heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie. very poor results.if anyone else out there also saw "sleepy hollow", they will probably have noticed, as i have, the declining quality of burton's films. i've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films. in "sleepy hollow", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (chris lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know). the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. "planet of the apes" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like "total recall" or "tango and cash" than like sci-fi. he's also fallen into the rut of so many other "big" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. word to burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in "mars attacks" or "beetlejuice") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.

ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours. when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left. but, ever hopeful, i stayed. and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time. acting was ok, but the story line is so transparent and weak. the script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue.

this movie is hilarious, not in good way. the fights are awfully bad done, while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie. a gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi's, pick up a gun, start shooting back and not get hurt. the story empty, guy waking up, lost his memory, starts fighting cos that's what he's good at. five years later memories come back, takes revenge blablabla. not worth your buck, not really worth your time unless you're drunk and bored.

this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it. what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? how on earth did they get funding for this abomination? the plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story... what story? the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.i guess i'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.*** spoler alert ***i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...i give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade imdb has to offer.do yourself a favour: see an uwe boll movie instead... twice... it's more worthy of your time.

i had always been a big lynda carter-wonder woman fan so when the sci-fi channel ran this movie,i had to see it.i was bitterly disappointed.this is a wonder woman movie in name only.she doesn't wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond.there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.it's just one long bad dream.i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway.i wouldn't waste your time on this.

apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is. at one point in this film, someone (i believe pacino's producer) warns him that film is getting off track, that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii. instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout. some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al (was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare's birthplace, other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there?), and, before the film has really even begun, we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera. i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act - but apparently it's how al really behaves in person.enough rambling. here's a shotgun smattering of why i didn't even make it 3/4 of the way through this: 1) pretentious - al always knows when the camera is on him, whether he's acting as richard or in a 'real' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes, also, some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme. if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside, it's unbearable. "look at me, chewing all the scenery!" 2) winona ryder. when she appears as lady anne, this film comes to a screeching halt, which it never recovers from. she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes. her performance is dreadful, to boot. 3) the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture. of course, you also learn that pacino shouldn't be directing films (or doing richard in the first place). i'd rather watch bobby deerfield than this.lastly, read the play and learn it for yourself. go out and see it performed. in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater, and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama (except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence! my god! was that necessary?!)it's all just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying nada.

it seems that salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and i say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. i'd say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. on the whole, a b-movie, hardly worth your money... vote: 4/10

this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot. in summary: the oil business is in cahoots with the government (or gummint if you prefer), the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots, and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way. the only people that get done over are the good ones, like mr clooney ("bob"). oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . that really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators.in syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again 2. people like clooney and hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script 3. if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see claude chabrol's "l'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted. empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length.

considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched. there was no real advancement of anything. character development, minimal. plot advancement, maybe. enjoyment, none. i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. in summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.

spoilers i guess. the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie. i just couldn't get over it. and what is wrong with mark wahlberg's character? if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes, i'd be all like, " aaaahhhhhhh!!! run for your lives! the monkeys have inherited the earth!" but he's all like, "talking apes, okay. next?" that's pretty jaded i'd say. he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis. besides that, this is rick baker's best work yet. this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field. 3/10.

we gave up at the point where george clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. we were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. to say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! how did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an oscar? clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. what was he thinking? oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? the film was hard enough to follow without that as well. i pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.

contrary to most other comments about "syriana" on the imdb web-site, i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space.in short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so "story-lines" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. no, sir, it does not. what does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.this kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.thank goodness, then, for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again.

not good! rent or buy the original! watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then....maybe.it is like claiming an elvis actor is as good as the real king.

this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. it was sort of a remake but then again, not really. i was very disappointed considering the tools that tim burton has at his disposal. he had great make up and cgi available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? heck no. so in that regard, the film fails.at least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. and, by the way, if you give it some thought, and i did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about it.this film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of "beneath the planet of the apes". here's how i would have written it:an astronaut (it really should have been more than marky mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so i would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. sadly, tim burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. consider what he did with the batman series. he's a rotten director inspite what of people think. he's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. sorry, but no. if anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.

i have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.good: effects and makeup are good. no complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (tim roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the "supporting supporting actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). the action scenes were exciting and fun.bad: the escape from the ape city was terrible. the characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape. plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?the story was pared down to include as much action as possible. i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented. without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it.

the acting was bad, the script was bad and the ending was just terrible...the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up...but apart from that...this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001...why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it...why!!!!

this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen. he has done it with `batman', `sleepy hollow' and now this. this is not a remake. the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and charleton heston makes a cameo). burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.the original planet of the apes was a product of its time. during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization. it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. in that context, pota was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. the dialectic between colonel taylor (charleton heston), dr. cornelius (roddy mcdowall) and dr. zira (kim hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties. this is apes for dummies. it is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. the `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `i know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'from a technical perspective, as is always the case with burton's film, the film is excellent. the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding (though i continue to dislike his dark look). however, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.the story has been reduced to a monster movie. the humans band together behind captain davidson (mark wahlberg) to fight the monstrous apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably helena bonham carter as ari). the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.the acting is mixed. mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. this part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire. helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.then there is tim roth. his is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade. he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time. additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.this film is a great disappointment. it is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. i rated it a 3/10. from a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. however the story is an insult to the original franchise. it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.

if there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. this "re-imagining" of planet of the apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. nova, the girl in the original planet of the apes, was a better developed character than daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.there were problems in basic plot development. the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out heston's taylor as being different from the other humans. in the current film, mark wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. they are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg. her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth.the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson (wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. this was poor character development. (estella warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in the green mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. but the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.in the original film, the various "human" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ("i never knew an ape i didn't like." "human see, human do!"). here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feet.nothing made me cringe more than the "v-ger from star trek" moment near the end of the film. first of all, the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form. secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. this moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. i'm thinking of 2001: a space odyssey, the 1967 planet of the apes, thx1138, soylent green, silent running and the 1972 solaris. the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. however, this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. in a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's "science fiction" you don't have to!overall, burton's most disappointing film.

warning: spoilers galore!tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot already did that - i rest my case.movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset. marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments? the special effects team decrees it.marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the time warp. marky then demonstrates the space station's mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.before anyone can say `pointless remake' marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.surprise! it's apes doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirty-three years ago.since marky mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. michael clarke duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. helena bonham-carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout. paul giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes `re-imagining': `the apes of roth'. while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke, tim roth, as chimpanzee thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. nice twist.the original pota (1968) featured a leading character, charlton heston's taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth - as their sole champion! the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when taylor discovers the statue of liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed. is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky mark's leo? or roth's thade? no, but there's lots of running.the slogans cry: take back the planet .but it's the apes' planet. in this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes deserved to inherit the planet! along comes marky mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators, simply because they're there. `taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `a planet where men evolved from apes??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he was ben-hur, michelangelo, moses! to cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect? marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. burton tries to elevate marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. in the original film, the apes deem taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. that irony again.it was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - heston - should play the father of this film's primo scene-chewer, thaddeus roth. as roth's ape-dad, charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the humans this time, `damn them! damn them all to hell!'the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. while thaddeus is giving marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with marky's chimpnaut in it. apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape! secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warren's half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.).no matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating, `it's a madhouse! a madhouse!!...'

thank you hollywood. yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. the original "planet of the apes" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. this movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues. instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. the make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. however, this does not distract from the fact that "planet of the apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. please hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.oh yeah, the ending did not make any sense whatsoever.* out of **** stars, mainly for the visuals

yes, chunky, this is the nick-name that donna reeds' romantic lead played by tom drake tags her with! so lets get this clear right away. from her first ingénue role in the get-away (1941) too her last, dallas (1984-1985) ms. reed could never be described as chunky. not this attractive and slim actress. whose roles at m.g.m. seldom lived up to her talents.ms. reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball' comedy. clearly m.g.m. was out of their depth making this type of film. a type better produced over at columbia, paramount, rko and even universal. neither the 'touch' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturges could save this film. a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre-war (wwii) effort.if irving thalberg had still been alive the screen-play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day. it did fit into louis b. mayer's 'safe-zone' of none challenging family entertainment. a form that could not stand up to the post-war challenges of the 'dehavilland decision', loss of their theater chains, television and would contribute to m.g.m.s decline. fortunetly for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity (1953) and her oscar win as best supporting actress.

i'm a jean harlow fan, because she had star quality. i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress, but she certainly was great in comedies. every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good. but this movie is perhaps more like a love story. jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. it always impresses me much to think that harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman. well, in this movie she does look beautiful.

this film has a weak plot, weak characterization, and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it. it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. the robots are sad and the main "hero" 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. it's sad when you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for. when all is said and done, this movie was better left on the cutting room floor, or never funded at all.

there's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland, and robot wars does deliver. sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. they are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well. its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable. i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.

this movie doesn't have an awful lot to do with it's predecessor "robot jox". this must be also the reason why its most common name is "robot wars" and not the alternate name "robot jox 2: robot wars"."robot jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future. this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn't very original or cleverly written. a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really, for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch.just like "robot jox" this is a b-movie but with as a big difference that it's just not a very good one. perhaps this also has to with the fact that "robot jox" got made during the '80's, when b-movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it, even though the movie got released in 1990. this really can't be said about this movie. it's just lame, badly made, poor looking and not exciting enough. it also has an ending which leaves you thinking 'this is it? that's all?'.what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot-line really. perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story, some action, or likable main characters.seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie. all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves as if he's god's gift to woman and mr. perfect who can compete with anyone. weren't they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie?for such a futuristic movie, with a concept of having large battle droids in it, this movie surely is lacking with its action. had they put some more and bigger action into the movie, the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch. instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable.you can better watch a "mighty morphin' power rangers" episode, for some more action and likability.3/10

i first didn't want to watch this film, for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film...but as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising "mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité"" which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard (screenwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), i changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "prête-moi ta main", would be as good as "mensonges...". and it is absolutely not. the script is not bad, but it is not as well directed as "mensonges...", the actors not as generous (especially charlotte, as boring as she usually is) as edouard baer or clovis cornillac, and too be honest, i still don't understand how such crap can have such a success, even with such a casting... anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as tirard's "mensonges..." though it's also written by him. easy, unsurprising, and lazy work. totally overestimated!

if there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - danny glover, alfre woodard, kevin kline, mary louise parker - would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity)... but, no. apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell. the entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene). grand canyon is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with or even tolerate them. with rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. there's no plot to speak of, no character development (these people won't ever develop), no break-out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film. the best thing about grand canyon? its title. this is one large hole of a movie.

why me? why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! at least if i can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile.i had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. otherwise, i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear. the movie was slow, had painfully little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an la-style token black man.if you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. note, though, that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an "la lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it.

oh what a condescending movie! set in los angeles, the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmakers, this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst.stereotyped, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday, humdrum lives. the plot is disjointed and desultory. numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like: a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.and through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological "insights" imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. one character tells another: "when you sit on the edge of that thing (the grand canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, i could tell, me and my worries; it's real humorous to that grand canyon".and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: "there's a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have ... it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... grand canyon, and what's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ...".aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story's pace is agonizingly slow. acting is uninspired and perfunctory. the film's tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script's contempt for viewers.this was a film project approved by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. they think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change.

this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens' bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book. contrary to what is probably received opinion, diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock. she was clunky and wooden. lady d. is a reserved character but not a martinet. denholm elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for mr. jarndyce. so i'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying: "i didn't read the book, so i don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book." true and not true. for ex, diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you've read the book. on the other hand, denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce (although too old). the series fails not because it's unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plot lines and characters just don't coalesce to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious andcompelling entertainment. it is dull and flat. if you want to make apossibly good bleak house, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes. but i suggest that producers etc. leave dickens alone (even a christmas carol). television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.

herculis puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. this movie or this story don't work and i felt its not agatha's mistake. the cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. the scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! the 'victim' is not likable.

this movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father. very predictable. both male "stars" need a good slap in the face! would you like some cheese with that "whine?" two chuckles...and a headache. i can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years...i don't know how she lasted that long! the first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the $3.99 to watch it! the movie didn't flow well and was painfully long. i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster...it didn't. the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space. on a positive note...the scenery was pretty, fall being my favorite season. the car, the 40 ford was also quite nice. this movie gets an d- rating approaching an f

very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. although released by rko, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. the cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited jack lord, director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. the performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. however, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. the location shooting in new york city, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior "the naked city", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. otherwise, it's not much to write home about. it is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets..

"demons iii: the ogre" is not related pre-sequel are on "the demons" and "the demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic."demons iii: the ogre" is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. i am very confuse about the writer is "demons iii: the ogre" (lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored william shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from spider's web or what huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). i am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. i bought the special dvd box called "demons" on the 3 different movies called "demons iii: the ogre", "the other hell", and "black demons" don't have closed captioned and subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from best buy store in the city of downey. why the lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like "halloween iii" don't have michael myer monster but the people wear halloween. i am very confused. i really love "the demons" and "the demons 2 are better the boring stupid "demons iii: the ogre" is not part for "the demons" and "the demons 2" are same demons.thank you juan antonio de la torre

(aka: demons iii)made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films. it was supposed to be simply titled, the ogre, which is how director lamberto bava had released it.an american family rents an italian villa for the summer. the woman (virginia bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. it glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. it drips what looks like green paint.of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. the villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids.the films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. there's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's jeep cherokee. the copy of the shriek dvd i watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw i hope shriek has since corrected. extras include a short interview with lamberto bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other shriek dvd releases. this is pretty standard stuff.3 out of 10

when the folks at kino video assembled their fine "slapstick encyclopedia" collection, a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies, someone decided to kick off the first installment with one too many (1916), an obscure one-reel farce made in florida starring the very young oliver hardy. as enjoyable as the set is over all, this decision was an unfortunate one, for one too many is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further. like any typical farce, this one involves deception inspired by greed, panic when plans go awry, and complications escalating to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good ones, one too many is incoherent, unfunny, and downright annoying. it's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film-making, but whatever the cause, by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening, and by the end one no longer cares.the only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year-old "babe" hardy, who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with stan laurel, but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy. in the opening scene, awakening with a hangover, babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed. trust me, that's as funny as this movie gets. if you read this before seeing the first cassette of kino's "slapstick encyclopedia" i suggest you fast-forward past this one and skip to the good stuff.

a sentimental school drama set in denmark, 1969, "we shall overcome" offers a pathetic danish take on us culture. frits (janus dissing rathke), a flower-power obsessed, naive 13-year-old, exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master lindum-svendsen's (bent mejding) office. lindum-svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant, has the local community in control. lindum-svendsen's gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there wasn't enough drama already..), and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher mr svale ('hi, call me freddie'), frits stands up for justice.tell you what. it's so unconvincing, over-(method-)acted, and so full of misery, that as a 'family' picture this grotesque -filled with cliché's- excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non-scandinavian audiences. sorry, kind danish readers, to crash like this into your sentimental journeys.. but it's definitely not a tale about a 'boy becoming a man by fighting the system'. the boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eyed cry-face. if you call a church of small minded small town folk, led by a dictator like cartoonish character "the system", i'm sorry if i'm missing something.if you're into family pictures, go see happy feet instead..

i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious. this movie went nowhere fast. what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, a picture of some dude's swimming pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing its job, and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating "t minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting is going to happen. it doesn't so don't get your hopes up. the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc, in something other than there famous tv personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good. and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. this movie is as close as i have given a one yet, but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn't have to leave in the middle. avoid at all costs.

"the brain machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about. four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but it seems he's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. good call there on the senator's part. there's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on, who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the general or 'the project'. too bad he wasn't more effective, he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.if nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones, room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit. perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title - "time warp"; nothing else would make any sense. as for myself, i'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr. krisner's experiment titled 'group stress project'. it applies to the film's actors and viewers alike.keep an eye out just above the general's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.you may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard gerald mcraney fan, could he have ever been that young? james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but don't call him father. for something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's "the killer shrews". that one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously.

you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles. generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets. such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles.its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves, or something like that. its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense.its a turkey of the untastey kind. avoid it.

this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. but for me, it failed. i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it.but it didn't work for me. i found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. i don't think that this is the case here.as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...i see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "action". and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one.

let's see, here are the "highlights" of the brain machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977. that's an easy one to explain. this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-watergate mood of distrust in government. after seeing the brain machine now, my only wonder is that it ever got released at all!

i bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title "grey matter". the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non-dukesofhazzard role intrigued me. as the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.and yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it. some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. it's actually kinda funny. after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "grey matter".i also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling. at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a "scientific b*tch!". it's just a very inadequate insult. several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that "scientific b**tard!". it just sounded very awkward to me.someday this movie will disappear forever. another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it. almost like it never happened.

ouch, what a painfully boring sci-fi movie! and that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! during the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files. as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed. figures from then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing. more like dull, pointless and vague. scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway. they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed; yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device. perhaps i missed something, but i doubt it. the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities. so basically, "the brain machine" just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room. the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings! the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five-second shot of the places. either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci-fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves. staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying, i assure you. james best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent, but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time. avoid!

oh, my gosh...i thought cbs primetime television shows were theworst things gerald mcraney appeared in...four people are experimented on by a crazed mind controlcomputer. that's it, don't rent it.i saw this under one of its many titles- "grey matter," and it isperhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. the otherreviews are right, it is awful. never have so many establishingshots appeared onscreen, never. the cast is awful, the directionis awful, and the script is awful. i cannot stress how awful this is. avoid it like you would smallpox.this is rated (pg) for physical violence, some gun violence, mildgore, some profanity, and some adult situations

someone mentioned editing. this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. for starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments. why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in? and, what exactly are they testing? apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit. the acting is pretty bad. everyone is emoting. everyone is keeping secrets. they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money, they'd hang it up. there's a deranged minister who spouts scripture. on and on. but, again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors. there are some really cheesy elements. those little rooms and those chaise lounges. the awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). it was interesting, but didn't seem to go anywhere.

dynasty revisited in hawaii... full of clichés, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. if you have nothing better to do however, it does provide 40 minutes of simple, unpretensive entertainment, endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery. on the other hand, if you are looking for anything more than that, stay away...oh, and by the way, if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one, you have two options: 1. you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or, 2. look at it as science fiction comedy as i did, lie back, relax, and laugh about it!

an absolutely wretched waste of film!! nothing ever happens. no ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. everything else is pathetic. the premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place, because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes. what? and the railroad leaves them no place to stay, in a heavy storm? i think not. oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields. umm, yeah. sure. or, they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality, and stay at the 'haunted' train station. a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring, utterly without ghosts, interest, or plot.so very terribly dull that this seems impossible.this ought to be added to the lost films list !! aargh !!

arthur askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. his juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. he has his moments in the ghost train, and his character, tommy gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star richard murdoch; betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; linden travers going over the top as a 'mad woman'. also on board are peter murray-hill, who off-screen married phyllis calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady carol lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance. it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham's brandy.

"a damsel in distress" is definitely not one of fred astaire's better musicals. but even astaire's bad films always had some good moments.in "damsel," astaire is jerry halliday, an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour. he meets lady alice marshmorton (19-year-old joan fontaine), a beautiful english heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. he tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry. keggs (reginald gardiner) the conniving butler, and albert (harry watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet.this musical has numerous problems. first, there is the plot, based on a novel by p.g. wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). the story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. when fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) fred romancing joan fontaine or (b) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other.the butler and the house boy are especially irritating. they are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance.astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, ginger rogers. joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. she has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride, as jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done. at times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in london, not hollywood. (they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) on the plus side, the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. and of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to astaire and his choreographer, hermes pan.but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. at times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (at one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) the numbers include:  "i'm dancing and i can't be bothered now" -- fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled london street. he does some great "cane-twirling" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (in the broadway musical, "crazy for you," harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) "put me to the test" -- fred, george, and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage. george and gracie match fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason. "stiff upper lip" (the fun house number) -- at an amusement park fun house, fred, george, and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. it's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times. "things are looking up" -- fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer. "a foggy day in london town" -- fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london. at times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself. "nice work if you can get it" -- a great song that is misused in the movie. during a social event at the manor house, fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. each time fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (again, harry groener did a better dance number with this song in "crazy for you.")  "drum dance number" -- as fred and joan are eloping, fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. as usual, it's a great dance number. but there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine. as he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. fred (or rather, a stuntman in fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote. the >>ff button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.

this "movie" is more like a music video. kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies, he feels like making music, and when he is making music, he feels like making movies. the best thing in "promise me this" is the music, written by stribor kusturica.kusturica said in the same interview, that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. "promise me this" has very little "noise".i liked "life is a miracle". it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "promise me this" has no plot. i was awaiting this movie with big expectations, because i've read, that the script has been written by ranko bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters, who participated also in "life is a miracle". ranko bozic writes great dialogues, but for kusturica they are "noise", and much to my regret, i saw only two dialogues, which i could identify as written by ranko bozic. the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor.gordan mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "time of the gypsies" and "black cat white cat") said in an interview, that kusturica never follows the script. "black cat white cat" was the only script, for which kusturica said, that he will not touch it. according to gordan mihic, after all kusturica comes back to the script, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. and i think this is the case with "promise me this". he should have followed the script of ranko bozic."promise me this" is billed as a "comedy", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. the comedic moments are in the same style as "black cat white cat", but are not that funny at all. i think the difference comes from the fact, that "black cat white cat" was written by gordan mihic.however, i know some people, who liked "promise me this", they find it very positive movie.

after life is a miracle, i did not expect much. it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell, for instance. zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with black cat, white cat, which i think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. i liked his early films so much, and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. let's hope his next one will be great.

i did not expect a lot from this movie, after the terrible "life is a miracle". it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "life ...". i have impression that director/writer is just joking with the audience: " let me see how much emptiness can you (audience) sustain". dialogues are empty, ... scenario is minimalistic. in few moments, photography is really nice. few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this "comedy". i've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end. if you can lift yourself above this director's fiasco, ... you will find good acting of few legends (miki manojlovic, aleksandar bercek), and very good performance of emir's son stribor kusturica.in short: too bad for such a great director ! emir kusturica is still young and should be making top-rated movies. instead, he chooses to do this low-budget just-for-my-private theater movie, with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans.

not really spoilers in my opinion, but i wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. as the executive producer, morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less, a movie with an intentional indie-feel, and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme. he plays a alternate universe, semi-washed up version of the real morgan freeman, who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson, ca from brentwood to research his next movie role. why carson, is a mystery to so. cal residents. he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements. paz vega is pretty to watch, a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman's research. his character is only known as "him" to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-"psst, that's 'him,' etc. unfortunately, i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does, then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has. nothing really happens in this movie. i don't believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. it flirts with the idea of adultery, but then that thought fizzles. this to me was similar to steve martin's shopgirl, without the sexual affair. it was self-indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience.

quite one of the worst films i have ever seen. terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. we know judge reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. there is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. apparently based on true events, though? if that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! unfortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.

let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable, particularly from "down argentine way", but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got "round" and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was bad, the colours good, and the film far too long. it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. the music score was woeful, and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as i was such a fan of miss grable, i always wish i had never seen this one!

the final film for ernst lubitsch, completed by otto preminger after lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics. in a 19th century castle in southeastern europe, a countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the hungarian revolt; she's aided by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life. betty grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. unfortunately, this script (by samson raphaelson, taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e. welisch) is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh--or entertain. the results are good-looking, but unabsorbing. *1/2 from ****

this miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film. they should have let it remain that way.what a colossal bomb! douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here. cesar romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette grable sings with a chorus- what i'll do to that hungarian!the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror. (fairbanks) now, let's fast forward to 300 years later, where grable, just married to the count romero, faces a similar situation, when on her wedding night, there is an invasion by hungarian soldiers.romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. he disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases fairbanks. the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when grable meets fairbanks to tell him the good news-an enraged romero has annulled the marriage.this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. as harry davenport, a veteran supporting player who is in it, died in 1949; this must have been his last film. what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career.walter abel co-stars but he can do little with such poor writing. the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age. i can't fathom what fairbanks was wearing.

watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do. someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. darryl f. zanuck should have known better.betty plays a 19th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks, jr. her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed.besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. that's going to give anyone a bad attitude, i guarantee.fresh, wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious. marlene dietrich might have put this over, but with betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything.frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song. that lady in ermine's one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bows.ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine. i can't believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here. neither will you if you see that lady in ermine.

if you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause sleepwalkers really sucks. usually i'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen walking home. where's his car?? anyway, just don't see it, folks. i really want to be more specific, but words escape me. cats jumping on people. a guy getting stabbed by corn. cheesey lines up the proverbial "wazoo". just don't see it. wait, i take that back! see it for writer stephen king's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. he's actually pretty good. even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman, king gives the best performance of the film. but, other than that...wow...bad.

i have nothing against a fast-paced fright-flick, but this stephen king-derived nonsense is too freshly-scrubbed, too bright and modern. the plot, about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a "sleepwalker"--sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf--and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for a more mysterious, ambiguous treatment. this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel, with hardly any atmosphere. the kids are predictably pretty and energetic, but the big plus is alice kridge as the boy's mother; kridge, from "ghost story", never broke out of the filler-female mold, and it's a huge loss that she hasn't been used more. her performance is creepy and intense, and gives hint that "sleepwalkers" might've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction. it's too over-the-top and commercially-driven, with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. stephen king pops up in a cameo, as do real-life directors john landis and tobe hooper. *1/2 from ****

it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people, but it wasn't.this work could have been just that; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled. the lead characters (charles brady played by brian krause; and his mother mary, played by alice krige) were shallowly done, had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing. not even mädchen amick (who played tanya robertson)'s character fit into that description. however, as i've said many times before, when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv, you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for tv, and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist. this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing, whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay. to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen. his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie; nothing less but certainly nothing more. his screenplays are hit and miss. unfortunately, this screenplay translation was a miss. sorry, sorry, sorry movie.this movie gets a 1.0/10 from...the fiend :.

this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex, they also get scared of little kitty cats. they get set on fire by them. the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn? they are bullet proof. invisible. and what not. the star of the movie, clovis, is the cops cat, clovis leads the cops to find the mom alien, and after the mom kills the cops, clovis kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire. this movie sucks. it was way way more funny than it was scary, it wasn't even scaryt at all. the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera, it knoks him out. she then goes and hugs her. the then grabs her and begins to rape her. once again, clovis comes to the rescue

written by stephen king, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret. they are sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. this little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.alice krige is outstanding as the mother. others appearing are madchen amick, brian krause and cindy pickett. look for very small roles for john landis and clive barker. stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.

return to cabin by the lake just.... was lacking. it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. so, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots and simple video camera shots. it makes for a very odd blend! i think they should have found some way to not do the "home video" type effect! i think it's worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences. but if you haven't seen the original cbtl.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.

preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. brian krause, who i thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, alison(..played by dahlia salem)seem to be taking over the production. andrew moxham is paul parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until alison realizes who stanley really is. alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. of course, you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director po-chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. this sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.

ah, channel 5 of local mexican t.v. everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. it was "return to cabin by the lake" the movie that aired yesterday. i regret for watching it.the original "cabin by the lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. the problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. ugh. the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.the movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.my advice is : avoid this one at all costs. it's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.you have been warned.

this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. once again it doesn't make since. the killer still kills for fun. but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.don't watch this. if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. you'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.don't let your children watch this. teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.

i thought "what's new scooby-doo" was pretty bad (yes, i'm sorry to say i didn't like it), since hanna-barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. when i heard "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue" was in the works, i thought it could be better. but when i saw a pic of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear, i knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. i watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another "teen titans" or "loonatics unleashed"-wannabe. no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. shaggy and scooby-doo have become more brave, too. also, since shaggy is not going to be a vegetarian in this series, casey kasem (whom actually is a vegetarian), the original voice of shaggy, will not voice shaggy. he will only voice shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the internet jokes weren't enough. so scott menville (whom previously voiced red herring on "a pup named scooby-doo") voices shaggy here. believe me, the voice is really bad! it makes shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. however, kasem does voice shaggy's uncle albert, which is a sort of good thing. scooby-doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scooby-doo from the live-action movies. also, scooby's frank welker voice (need i mention brain the dog again?) still hasn't improved. robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than scrappy-doo! he tries to be funny and does "comical" impressions and gives safety tips ("remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!"), but it just doesn't fit into a scooby-doo cartoon. again, the hanna-barbera sound effects are rarely used here. however, on one episode, "lightning strikes twice," they use the "castle thunder" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (although they do still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) scooby-doo hasn't use "castle thunder" sound effects since 1991. but my question is, why use "castle thunder" on "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue," while not use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on "what's new scooby-doo!" (two episodes of wnsd used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) if wnsd and the dtv movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. the day this show premiered, i watched the first episode, and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes! to get my mind off of this poor show, i rented "scooby-doo, pirates ahoy!" which came out around the same time. and you know what? the "pirates ahoy" movie was actually better than "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue" (and even better than "what's new, scooby-doo!") and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. the direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. but, whether you loved or hated "what's new scooby-doo," i don't recommend it. but if you hate the old series, then you'll love it! (oh god, i hope the old scooby-doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!) anyways, like wnsd, a really bad addition to the scooby canon.

as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scooby.if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special saturday morning cartoon. but that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" scooby and gang. i'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but i'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series(where are you).scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this. let's hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers.

i am 17, and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes. i love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade, scooby doo and the goblin king, which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. anyway, back to get a clue! i watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what i saw of it, i wasn't impressed at all. first of all, i hated the animation. it was flat, deflated and very saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation. even worse, shaggy and scooby looked like aliens, and i really missed fred, velma and daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when scooby doo was positively good. i also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby-doo where are you? show. the theme tune wasn't very good either, i can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. though, i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might i add. in conclusion, i personally thought it was awful, and i am not trying to discredit it, it's what i personally feel. 1/10 bethany cox

shaggy & scooby-doo get a clue. it's like watching a much-loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness!! clearly the work of people with no soul, no love or respect for the original work. what in the name of all that's holy were they thinking of? it seems they were trying to go all post-modern and ironic. instead it's just abysmal swill!! what's the point in taking up a successful franchise like 'scooby-doo' if you just going to flush it down the toilet? my son loves the original series - and even some of the spin-off movies - but he can't stand this drivel! and let's face it, you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year-old

the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. i didn't think much of the scooby doo animated movies, (i'm talking about the tv series, not the full length movies.), but some of them were pretty cool, and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. as soon as i saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and i use that term loosely) speak, i cringed. also, mystery inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants. what's new scooby doo was better than this. if you're going to have a scooby doo tv series, include the elements that made the series endure so long. the entire cast of characters, and quality animation. they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came.

a shaky hand-held camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion-sickness just from watching it. it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (no offense meant to cp sufferers, but i don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer!) the camera work was so nauseating, and so distracting, that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture. i checked back a while later (it was showing on tv), and it hadn't gotten any better. i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten!

for all its visual delights, how much better renaissance would have been in live action. the animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and the style of this film. with real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless. there is much to admire here, but at the end i found that all i could do was admire. i did not enjoy the movie that much, and it clarifies something that i did not see before: that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, it can all be for nothing. i will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. i love dark sci-fi thrillers. blade runner and dark city are two films i thought were wonderful. but blade runner had its tragic villain and dark city had its thought-provoking story arc. renaissance has shadow and light, but little else. i wish i could have liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that. the renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life. how ironic, then, that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies i've seen this year takes its title from the renaissance.

i read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it. since i'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey !! it is a lifetime movie.the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses.the female cast is right out of desperate housewives. i've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist. is there nothing original anymore? sure, but not on lifetime.the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose.in one scene a female is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do??? kicks him in the testicles. what else? women love that but let me tell you girls something... it's not as easy as it's always made to look.it wasn't all bad. i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that.

not that i was really surprised....movies are never as good as the books that they originated from. i was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, even though i knew it would probably suck. i was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. however, they strayed from the book's storyline too much, and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was. ending was different too. lara flynn boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery. the acting was unremarkable at best. perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in lifetime's "made for tv movie" box, it would be a better flick. if you saw this movie i highly encourage you to track down the book and read it. i doubt you'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it.

it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie-ready' as "the house next door" to be adapted for film or television. the book was copyrighted in 1978. one reason could be problems designing 'the house'. the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i can't imagine anyone buying it. in fact it's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built.i'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago. the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life, and this is one of the book's strengths. they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon..(or the devil personified) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. however, it is a downbeat book for the most part, and i don't think that appeals to the people who run lifetime. maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come. a better house..better music..a better screenplay and darker lighting...would certainly help.

the cast is ok. the script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. i guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. the shower part...huh? what was that about? literally, it is i have a client, "ok you can use our shower." yawn. the angles are trying way to hard. there was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying. in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions.

no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for "the house next door" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. this lifetime-like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough. having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can't find in this version we watched.the film's star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, ms. boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better.the film has a feeling of a cross between "desperate houswives" with "the stepford wives" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.

at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it. in all honesty, my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie. and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman, when a new version of that just came out...nice touch guys, it was misleading enough to rope me in. the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut. usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it. the film looks like it was shot by a d+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes....sometimes, less is more buddy. through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained. all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad movie. without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school, but hey maybe i'm a bit biased, i mean i did get to play an extra. p.s. i don't even think this deserves a star...not even a half. none for you!!

not that "a film by ulli lommel" filled me with hope, but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. but many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. the effect is never perfect, but it helps. unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mockumentary" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. therein lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer. watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. it does not feel like watching a movie. and what's even more unforgivable is that the lommel is not a young filmmaker. he ought to know better. he ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. and lucky us, he wrote the script too! so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. please, please miss this film. you'll thank me later.

as there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom. it was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter. you have to know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville. i really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned. this was by far one of the worst. with in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on clark's infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week. may as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day.

this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. nothing new or original is added other than perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. i can't understand any high ratings for this at all. it's quite bad. why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it?

why do they insist on making re-makes of great movies like "high noon" "from here to eternity" and this one?why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white?why did robert's insist on wearing that dopey, broad-billed, baseball cap?...it made him look like jim varney.why would anyone spend four hours suffering through this?watch the original. then you won't have to ask yourself why.

in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry. capote coined the phrase "nonfiction novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script, which he co-wrote. despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story. this is the first problem with the tv remake --color changes the tone of the story. in addition, the confinement of shooting a film for tv makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused. as a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment, and execution) so claustrophobic. on the small screen, it's just another version of law and order spin-offs. hollywood's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age. usually, that's a mistake, and this is no exception.all of the actors are competent. the script is ok. the directing doesn't get in the way. it's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument. it doesn't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward smith and hickock that the original film provokes. at the end of the tv version, we are left with the feeling: "ho hum, who cares?"see the original first, on as large a screen as you can, then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967.wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book. it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material, and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie.i actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs--the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an

there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "film". the original said it all and still holds up. either read the book or do some research about the story, and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous. eric roberts as perry smith? his sister could have done a better job! having been to holcomb & edgerton, ks where the story takes place, the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas. the original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings. unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake. soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad hall...the original is available on dvd in widescreen now. let this turkey die a quick death.

anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film. all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady, and given "three" in return. three what? not three wishes, but three rides into the 1800's on a rickety elevator...the first novel is time at the top. the second is all in good time.

sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic, boring and way too long. i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it.

i can find very little thats good to say about this film. i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people. i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography. michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor, and at no time no did i actually believe in his character. the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son. some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller. the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars, wondering why i bothered to watch it at all.

a call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. "dressed to kill" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. much of the acting (with the exception of young keith gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of de palma's own "carrie"--not to mention "psycho". the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock, not an homage. stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from ****

a repressed housewife (an annoying lisping angie dickinson, whose body double treats/horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch-out. this directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (nancy allen, clearly i am in the wrong business if she can bring home $600 a night) and her psychologist (michael caine). if you are going to watch de palma rip off (excuse me, "pay homage to") hitchcock, watch "sisters" instead of this. "dressed to kill," while loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the tackiest thrillers i have had the displeasure of sitting through. the plot is absurd and tired. it does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan, as long as they can get past the silly story line, that must have been dated even in 1980.

the only film i've ever walked out on. amazing, since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap. but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on, particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged.from the beginning to the end this film offends. worse, it ain't funny. it wasn't funny then, and it sure ain't funny now. but even worse, is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart, sophisticated comedy. it's juvenile, really sophomoric script and ideas began an era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs, and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film.sexual olympics? what high school kid hasn't thought of that? the beginning of the end.

i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn't think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasn't the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era! if this isn't the least funny set of sketch *comedy* i've ever seen it'll do till it comes along. half of the skits had already been done (and infinitely better) by acts such as monty python and woody allen... if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel-ridden this waste of 75 minutes is. seminal comedy? only in the world where seminal really does mean semen. scatological humour? only in a world where scat is actually feces. precursor jokes? only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy. tits and bums and the odd beaver. nice...if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven't found out that playboy exists. give it a break because it was the early 70s? no way. there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior. the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint. retro? hardly. sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles (and it could actually have been funny) but it just comes off as really quite sad. what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes? sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end. i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score...and i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients...or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw...their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief.

hearing about how hilarious this movie is, i finally rent it atthe video store and for 75 minutes maybe i laughed 3 times. thismovie, a collection of skits that make fun of television is anincoherrent mess. the jokes fall flat, the humor deals withissues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore, andthe jokes go on way too long (almost like the new snl skits thepast few years). yeah, chevy chase is in this but maybe of allabout 1 or 2 minutes. i liked the fact that this was veryraunchy and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny? doyourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a farsuperior film made in the

oh dear. while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level. fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe. it seriously is very, very bad. while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of it's release (1974) it still remains neither funny or acutely observed. the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom. this is credited as chevy's movie debut and i'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it. avoid even if curious.

the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me. i had received an e-mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie. it was neither great nor inspirational. the cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie. a lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about. the voices were often distorted for no reason. also many of the people in the movie were far fetched. the relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear. also the whole movie has most him one way, and then all of a sudden bam, he is cured and inspiring people. the whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way that he is living it, but when he changes, he doesn't leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. thumbs down.

i went to go see this at the esquire theatre in cincy, oh, and - i hate my life now.christopher reeves would have been a more believable boxer.as a film it was painful, but seeing bret carr in person was to see desperation at its pinnacle.my favorite part of the movie was seeing bc slammed in the face with what appeared to be a "c" battery. the jury is still out on this. it was from a dildo and it was in slow-mo. yep."shoot the left side of the face only...people become famous by demanding things!" - bret carr b. carr donned a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology, roaming the streets of clifton bashing his own film. he should. this is correct to bash the film.my soul felt chafed after this movie.bret carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, or smart enough for that matter. that is the feeling you get from the what the bleepesque trickle of brainwashed, impressionable neo-yuppies that came to see this bret carr piece of work.it's an emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this film, so goodbye.-anonymous

after too many bad memories, i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence. i recently watched it again just to remind me why. i've always considered this the worst st:tng episode (with the exception of "shades of gray," which barely counts as an episode at all).i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's writing 101 teacher: "show, don't tell!" from deanna troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue okona is, to guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. unfortunately, bill campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. on the other hand, it could be that no one short of john barrowman (jack harkness from "doctor who") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.(zero points, by the way, to the data subplot. while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here. although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)on a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode. me, i'd rather skip ahead to "time squared" or "q who."

i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday. first of all, i wanted to see gina lollobrigida - and here i wasn't disappointed. she looked gorgeous. second of all, through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca's films. on this account, however, i was sadly disappointed. i found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. i kept watching until the end, but i got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida.

i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. i figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers. ... but the movie was confused and pointless ...it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in. also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love.it seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero .. but i guess not. this is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be. you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date. if the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might have a fighting chance. a serious waste of time.b

oh my god. oh my god, i cant get over this movie. it was god-awful. horrible, terrible! don't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bin. no, avoid it at all costs i'm warning you!!!it was the worst movie i've ever seen. in my life. in my life!!first of all, g-girl? are you kidding me. get real that sounds like some kind of new barbie doll.. super women? are you kidding me. it was so fake fake fake fake. the people of the town didn't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just zooming her way around the town saving a fire.. ohh big!jesus, was it just me or did this movie seem offensive?? i guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double d's, blonde flowing hair, no glasses and a leather skin tight suit?!if it was trying to be romantic ... than.. god, i don't know. it was horrid, if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed and in the air.. than they totally had love!it was pathetic, everything went too fast. first that guy was single, than he was dating g-girl.. than they broke up than he dated that hannah girl.. and.. it just goes on. i have to say this movie made me wonder.. how the hell did they get this in theaters??!!avoid this movie at all costs.

bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist. cinema was one of his biggest passions (he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life. but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews: "tiré à part" (1996) in spite of terence stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters, "une affaire de goût" (2000) was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance, "pas si grave" (2003) was another let-down and "un petit jeu sans conséquence" is as underwhelming as its predecessors. its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way.and however, the starting idea let predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion. to play with their guests, they pretend to part company with each other. and things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them. the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple.in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal, rapp's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. the plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters who have specific well-known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are. verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable. they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them, especially sandrine kiberlain. the audience is soon caught in a deep torpor.it's regrettable to say it: bernard rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as "un petit jeu sans conséquence" bears witness.

ugh. this is a terrible film, full of disastrous comic relief, no scares, and scary leaps in story and plotline. the only creepy thing here is the leading lady's hats. lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows. i give this a 1, and this ain't no fun.

bela lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance/hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep bela's wife eternally young. some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. bela lugosi hams it up nicely, but you can tell he needed the money. this film is thoroughly awful, and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film. i got the dvd in a discount store 2 for £1, which i think is a pretty accurate valuation, anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind.

i bought this video at walmart's $1 bin. i think i over-paid!!! in the 1940s, bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios (in this case, monogram--the ones who made most of the bowry boys films). while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved (ed wood "classics" such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space), they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans.i am an old movie junkie, so i gave this a try. besides, a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this one.lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides. they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all.anyways, a really annoying female reporter (a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen! so, she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi. lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf). naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! eventually, the maniacs all die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well. at the conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry. and, naturally, the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs. if you haven't noticed, there's a lot of fainting in this film. or, maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!

was this movie stupid? yup. did this movie depth? nope. character development? nope. plot twists? nope. this was simply a movie about a highly-fictionalized springer show. it shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on tv. molly hagan did a great job as jaime pressly's mom. jaime is....well...gorgeous! this flick wasn't so much made to be a "breakthrough" movie, rather, it was intended to life in a trailer park (i live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive rusted-out '66 ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention "trailer park"). some people over-analyze movies (case-in-point: star trek freaks). i watch movies purely for the entertainment value; not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the "goofs" bit about connie's shirt. could it have been better? sure. but it was funny as hell.

i will admit that i have seen maybe five minutes of "jerry springer". i don't consider myself a snob, but i really think that i am above watching what's on his show. you should try to elevate yourself above that too.i saw this movie as part of a social studies event i was conducting. i was told that this movie really had little to do with springer himself, rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on "springer." handled better, this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are. i will admit, i felt a twinge of empathy for connie (molly hagan). this is all she has in life. how sad that she feels she must go on jerry's show in order to resolve this.i really feel sorry for molly hagan appearing in this. have you noticed that after this movie, she has mainly been relegated to "b" roles on tv? i will say this about hagan. she is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. i have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy. the problem is that hagan can't carry a scene on her own. she just doesn't have what it takes to do a lead role. her best work will always be angel on "herman's head" (a show that was not great, but its heart was in the right place) and when she guested on "seinfeld" as sister roberta.

this movie is just bad. bad. bad. bad. now that i've gotten that out of the way, i feel better. this movie is poor from beginning to end. the story is lame. the 3-d segment is really bad. freddy is at his cartoon character worst. thank god they killed him off. and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos?the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on freddy. we see he once had a family, and we get to see his abusive, alcoholic father (alice cooper).other than that, all bad. there are some quality actors in here (lisa zane and yaphet kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad. the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back.

i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible. the deaths are so trendy. if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated. i did like the flashbacks. i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive. that would have been more interesting. this is a movie you can take or leave. depends on how much spare time you have.

this movie had a good story, but was brought down because it didn't have enough horror film elements and violence. it was like watching a live action cartoon. it would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going.

okay this is stupid,they say their not making another nightmare film,that this is the "last" one...and what do they do?they go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was bad,but why do they play us. anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.the plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. i didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!id say. i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.this is so different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime. how can they have gone this far?didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?yet they make this?its all bout the money,do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series.i gave a nightmare on elm street six (6) 3 out of 10.good points of movie: had potential with plot.bad points of film: terrible acting/lack of deaths/too funny to be classified as horror/very confusing.

sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**spoiler**) needs a family member in order to do it.a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all. works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (too many wisecracks, that's for sure.) the actors aren't interesting (save robert englund, as always, and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. the finale is ok but doesn't provide as many sparks as i think one might hope.in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story, it provides englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before.there are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker alice cooper, and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.film debut of breckin meyer, who plays spencer.one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits.4/10

freddy's dead: the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger (robert englund) leaves a teenager (shon greenblatt) on the outskirt's of springwood with no memory of himself, who he is or why he is there. the local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie burroughs (lisa zane) interviews him, she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone. it all turns out that it's an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter & use her to escape springwood. when maggie realises what freddy is up to her & some kids decide they have to kill freddy once & for all...directed by rachel talalay this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five, of course as any horror film fan know's if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there's no way in hell freddy's dead: the final nightmare was going to be the last one which, of course, it wasn't. the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & freddy's dead: the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them. the film moves at a reasonable pace & it's rarely boring but it's so silly, childish & feels like some sort of live-action cartoon with some awful set-piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes craven's suspenseful & effective early 80's original. the sequence where stoner spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on it's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall & floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing i've seen in a while, or maybe the early scenes when the john doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the coyote cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard. you can't take this seriously & i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing. when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon, yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3-d glasses! the character's are poor, the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing, it doesn't really stick to the elm street continuity & overall the film is a bit of a mess, the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour & you can certainly laugh at it.the film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark, scary & sinister yet it's so silly & simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat. there's not much gore in this one, there's some cut off fingers, some stabbings, someone falls on a bed of nails & that's about it. the body count is extremely low here with only three death's. the final twenty or so minutes of freddy's dead: the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3-d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-d which take advantage of the process. the special effects vary, some are quite good actually while other's are terrible & freddy's burnt make-up this time looks quite poor.this apparently had a budget of about $5,000,000 (it had an opening weekend box-office take of $12,000,000) & the film has a few nice visual touches & gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is. the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold & roseanne, johnny depp & rocker alice cooper.freddy's dead: the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series & apart from some unintentional laugh value there's not much here to recommend or enjoy. fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from wes craven's original classic shocker as it gets. followed by new nightmare (1994) which tried to take freddy krueger & the series in a new & different direction.

unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure to the "nightmare on elm street"-series! part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. this isn't just the worst entry in the "elm street" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre! the story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom & jerry cartoon. the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house? the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. you'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures, but no there's only one teenage-survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter. another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure. the john doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults! how about that: freddy krueger, who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3d-glasses! sort of like ruins the whole essence, doesn't it? as far as i'm concerned, "nightmare on elm street" has always been a dreadfully overrated series but, up until now, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. "freddy's dead", however, is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it.

warning: review contains mild spoilersa couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st. series. however, just two years on and i find i can't remember enough about them in order to do it  i guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. from what i do recall, some of the sequels  dream warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. but while i cannot recall much of the first five films, i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy's dead.an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. the fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, robert englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. i always thought freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. it's like englund's crying out "we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?" and i'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. was freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? all he gets to do here is a few "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars" and that's it. if this was the only elm st. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. even as the character pre-death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.acting is almost universally poor. just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. only kananga himself, yaphet kotto, keeps his dignity. and when roseanne, tom arnold and alice cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. the script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. carlos (ricky dean logan) opens a road map, upon which the noel coward-like freddy has wittily written "you're f**ked". when prompted for the map, carlos responds "well the map says we're f**ked". who wrote the screenplay, oscar wilde?or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. oddly, the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. "nice hearing from you, carlos", quips freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. it's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into freddy's world. though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-d finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. tracy (lezlie deane) is the only one who gets to greet freddy with "shut the f**k up, man" and a kick in the scallops. and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? freddy's dead. no laughs. no scares. no interest. no fun.

actually, they don't, but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is. there were some moments that could have been good, but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities, and don't get me started on the bad.the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious, but i will recap them here in case anyone cares. anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. the first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with freddy's long-lost child. now, the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer (and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent) is hereditary, so why not a mystery-type slasher in which lisa zane's character dreams of freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? sound like a good plot idea to you? obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de luca.then there's the trip to springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. the essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror show.of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. that, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with freddy's dead: it just doesn't try at all, leave alone hard enough.on a related note, i feel kind of sorry for robert englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character. he has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries "v", for example), and to be forever remembered as "the man who played freddy" is selling him rather short. it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. as for the rest of the cast, well, i think their performances here speak for themselves. they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than b-grade horror props. even yaphet kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of b-films.all in all, freddy's dead gets a 1 out of me. i'd vote lower, but the imdb doesn't allow for that. fd is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.

freddy's dead: the final nightmare, the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel. i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child. i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday, so i got to see all the sequels. may i say that i'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least the past two, it just seems like freddy lost his edge. it's almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. this was a sequel that wasn't needed, sorry to robert englund, but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents.freddy is back, but he's got something we don't know about, a daughter. maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. she has to do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. ironic, isn't it? but freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.freddy's dead: the final nightmare is also presented in 3-d, radical, huh? note the sarcasm. this is one of the worst sequels, it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series, i'd rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest. this just had bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story. i didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not father knows best.2/10

george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune. he interviews her on her yacht. they fall for each other in bathing costumes.it turns out (quite early) that she is not an heiress. she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream.the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance.the supporting cast does little to buoy it up. davis and brent carry the picture. though it's fairly predictable, it is also fairly entertaining. it's far from her best. but, especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre, it's not one of her worst, either.

this movie stinks. the stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long. i can't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film. whew!

why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. also, there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie. he was uncredited but his list of roles here (imdb) does give him credit. btw... rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. this film is proof that no matter how many big "names" you have. sow's ears don't make silk purses. i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad... maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film. it has no endearing, entertaining, or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else.

i'll admit. i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in (unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin, the avengers) and this one.this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen. (yes it ranks even lower than the avengers). everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief. even if you think uma is a goddess like i do, please please don't subject yourself to this movie. you'll hate yourself the following morning for it.

when it comes to movies, i am generally easily entertained and not very critical, but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start. i gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it. what a waste of some great talent! i was very disappointed with this movie, as it was not what i expected.

i´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by. i expected something better from uma thurman, which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place. an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality. it´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews. this movie deserves it.

there are movies like "plan 9" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like "waterworld" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like "desperate living" that you hate to admit you love. cowgirls have none of these redemptions. the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what i've been told, the book is enjoyable.how then could this movie be so intolerably bad? to begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations. open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way. finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. he does have twenty years of cutting experience.this movie now defines the basement for me. it is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.

this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. cool title, excellent director (i saw "to die for" and "drugstore cowboy" before this), and hey - uma thurman in the cast. how can you go wrong? well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this turkey.disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. its critical lambasting was well deserved. you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. zero out of ****.

certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form, featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by rain joan of arc phoenix (river's sister, inevitably), as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbins, the author of the novel, which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charms.

i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix. i thought i would give their sister a try, rain phoenix. i regret checking it out. she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? i have never been so unsatisfied in my life. it was just total rubbish. i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. i thought she was everything but that. those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? whats the point??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. hopefully, rain is better in other films, i forgive her for this one performance, i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film.

i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought "time to watch it". big mistake!a long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks, take for example pat morita. even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. even when you see it in the "under $5" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the urge!

i won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this. this was completely old fashioned. at every stage of this movie, i hoped for some twist and what do i get? the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. they are so darn shy even after so many meetings. i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. all she did was crib madly. hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. this movie is a dream. happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie. anyway i believe i wasted my time. i give it a 2/10.

i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, i gotta come really hard on it. talking about vivah, this guy, sooraj badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. after success of hum aapke hain kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind.there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say 'oh! at least this thing is good'. aloknath does cliché in a role of girl's father, shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed, amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.now the spoiler, i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.

in director sooraj barjatya's vivah,20-something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure, small-town girl his father has selected for him to marry. drawn to her innocence and simplicity, shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he's met her at her home in madhupur, and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor. the marriage is fixed for six months later, and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young, budding love, their geographical distance notwithstanding. but amrita, who's been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents' death, is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage. and then, it's up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally.much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain, barjatya's new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise. but sadly, the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated, even more far-fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps. and the problem is clear  you just can't relate to such squeaky-clean characters who don't have one bad bone in their bodies. there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films, and timing is one such important factor. twenty-five years ago, perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch, but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp. perhaps the film's only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish, you can make out right away that the filmmaker's intention is not to deceive. judging both by barjatya's previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world, he believes in his good-as-gold characters, he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps.but alas, he's unable to translate his vision to the screen. it's difficult to overlook how one-dimensional his protagonists are  shahid and amrita, both virtuous and virginal  i mean, think about it, the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film. barjatya may think he's returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah, but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film, or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry. because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah, those pairs had mischief and masti. shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring.for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story, the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s-style tunes that only further slacken the film's deadening pace. but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn't work for me, it's because i'm not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya's story. to some perhaps, vivah will give hope, that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere. but i'm a little cynical i guess. so, give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun, give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya, i'll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain. but save me from these dullards. you know, some marriages aren't made in heaven. this one's vivah!

from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even peter falk can't find his way) "finding john christmas" is better left lost. ms. bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah. jennifer pisana as soccoro, the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. but who can blame them with material like this. michael j. murray's script is juvenile at best. each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. films like "miracle on 34th street", ernst lubitsch's delightful "the shop around the corner" and, of course the 1951 version of "scrooge". there's frank capra's classics "it's a wonderful life" and "meet john doe". hey, forget the classics. what about "home alone" or " home for the holidays" with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr.? my present to you is by way of advice. your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "finding john christmas". merry christmas!

william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie. he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. but he tries to keep away from his family. thats where peter falk (colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (peter falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. but william russ wasn't truly a star. however, it appears his acting is still ok.i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. in fact, the last 20 minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened. a good movie should never be like that.overall, it was a sub-par movie. in a letter grading system, it would receive a "d".

the silent one-panel cartoon henry comes to fleischer studios, billed as "the world's funniest human" in this dull little cartoon. betty, long past her prime, thanks to the production code, is running a pet shop and leaves henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. a bore.

beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.the opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.and aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time. pure genius.the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. perhaps i own the only copy in existence.

i might have given this movie a higher rating before peter jackson's trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison. the pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. the animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which i found distracting. and the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished. there are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. watch this one if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. but if you haven't read the book you'll probably be confused, because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 out of 10.

i haven't seen this movie in a while, so i'm afraid i can't be very specific about details... it did have some interesting points. ralph bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of j.r.r tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project, so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production. therefore, not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy (with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made), the film itself seems less than finished. it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed, but whether or not it's intentional is hard to say. the whole thing seems shabbily made and undone, especially the orcs and the nazgul. another problem, of course, is the huge gaps in the plot. bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie, and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours (the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time.) far too many important bits were left out (and i don't refer only to tom bombadil, which, i think, was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie.) and of course, the ending, which is completely sudden and out of place. i'm not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there, or if he even had any idea where he's going to end it.the characters... well, most of them were okay. the hobbits don't look so bad (except for the gay sam. did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character?) if you're a tolkien fanatic (like me), watch this movie (though i'm not too sure about buying it. what special features does the dvd version have, anyway?) but know in advance that you're not going to watch a real 'lord of the rings movie' but not much more than a historical curiosity, which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan (i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool. the idea was to cast george as gandalf, paul as frodo, ringo as sam and john as gollum.) if you didn't read the book or didn't like it much or don't like animation films or don't want to see a half-finished movie... stay away.

i remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. of course, i was seven at the time.right before the jackson movies came out, my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic.ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of "the fellowship of the rings" and part of "the two towers" -- was pared down even more. what you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the cliff notes of the books.its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that i found lacking in the jackson movies. its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long tv special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. all i will say about that is that it was a musical.

i saw this movie during a tolkien-themed interim class during my sophomore year of college. i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing, but they weren't within constant eyesight.let's get it out of the way: the peter jackson 'lord of the rings' films do owe something to the bakshi film. in jackson's version of the fellowship of the ring, for instance, the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi's film, shot by shot. you could call this plagiarism or homage, depending on your agenda. i'm sure the similarities don't stop there. i'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film. i'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around.this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. i've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- if i've left out anything else that offended me it's because i'm completely overwhelmed, confronted with a wealth of failure (and, at high points, mediocrity).*due to heavy use of rotoscoping, gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film).*saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman' during the film, without explanation. he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason.*sam is flat out hideous. the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying. yes, hobbits are small like children, but they are not children.*merry and pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation. the film is filled with sloppy editing like this.*frodo, sam, pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road. one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back--which was not visible before--and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into "la-la-la"s. awful.*aragorn, apparently, is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants), complete with huge, square pilgrim belt buckle. he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie--oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass.*the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil. they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace. this is disturbing to be sure, but not frightening.*the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen (in which they stare at frodo, who is on the other side on horseback) goes on forever, during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and... do nothing else. the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound. it turns out to be more plodding than anything else.*gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf. he's a dwarf. there is simply no excuse for that. he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome. it's a crude but accurate description.*boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode. he looks ridiculous.*despite the similarity to tolkien's illustration, the balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film. it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers, and it's barely taller than gandalf. "purists" may prefer this balrog, but i'll take jackson's version any day.*the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments. i'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in jackson's film, but they are supposed to be fighting.*treebeard makes a very short appearance, and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all. watch the film, you'll see what i mean.alright, now for the good parts of the film.*some of the voice acting is pretty good. it isn't that aragorn sounds bad, he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant.*galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal; like tom bombadil, she seems immune to the ring's powers of temptation, and her voice actress isn't horrible either.*boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in jackson's portrayal of the same scene, but it's still appropriately dramatic (and more true to his death in the book, though i don't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did).*as my professor pointed out (between whispered threats), the orcs (mainly at helm's deep, if i'm correct) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted.*while this isn't really a positive point about the film, bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie, or so i've been told--the project was on a tight budget, and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups (who i'm sure hadn't read the books).let me be clear: i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude. i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product. overall, i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs, unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. i'm sure somebody, somewhere, will pick a copy of this up in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it.

some people don't like the animation. personally, i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done. there are lots of older cartoons that i just love. my problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was constructed. the characters are all just... well, goofy. and for this movie, they shouldn't be. apparently, everyone in lotr has a limping problem (for starters.) just the way they acted in general annoyed me. my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie. i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have gone. i'm glad i rented this and didn't buy it. there are few movies that give me a headache. this was one of them. however, this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, although it ranks up there. or down there, depending on your view.

i cant describe how terrible this movie is. am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting? the men of rohan look 100% fake with their poorly colored hair, that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like. the orcs looked terrible. why does gandalf walk with a bad limp? why cant they pronounce things correctly? saruman isnt aruman. there were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation*sp* of tolkiens characters. all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal, it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion. go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of tolkiens work. hell, even the cartoon version of rotk is better then this dribble. 2/10

obviously, i didn't care for things to come (aka "the shape of things to come") as much as most viewers. that means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than i did. at any rate, you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view.directed by william cameron menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director, this is a film adaptation by h.g. wells of his own novel by the same name. in my eyes, it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.the film opens in 1940 in a london-like "everytown". war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them. it does. and it turns into a decades-long affair that basically destroys civilization. wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath. we see two pilots, one downed, coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting. we meet a post-apocalyptic community ruled over by a would-be warlord. we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society. we see the way that technology is changing. and finally, we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036, where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.that might all sound potentially very exciting, but it just does not work as a film. structurally, the film is far too episodic, with little to dramatically tie it together. by the third segment, i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments. there's a constant parade of new faces. we don't get to learn anything about any of them.it doesn't help that the individual segments, with a couple exceptions, tend to be awkwardly directed and edited. they are also occasionally manipulative--it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. but maybe contradictorily, the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally.in fact, one overlong section is more like a music video/industrial promotional video. if features shots of building the futuristic city, with lots of large machinery, lots of welding, and so on. at one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass. the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score. i can't say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is "a film about ideas". that may be true, but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way. one, it still doesn't make it work _as a film_, that is, as a visual and aural dramatic artwork, and two, there are far too many ideas presented here.the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. that's a fine thing to make a film about. it's also remarkably prescient of world war ii, as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). wells has some interesting things to say about war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. for example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out, or will at any moment. the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic. wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised, although it doesn't preclude "progress"--in fact, maybe it fuels progress, at least indirectly.that would certainly be enough for one film. however, there are many more ideas here. the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film. it deals with a complex dilemma. one pilot has shot the other down, but is now coming to assist him. but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field. they can't both breathe the gas without harm. a girl comes along. they only have two functioning gas-masks between them. the pilot who was shot down offers his mask, as he says he's dying anyway. what to do? it's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length, but the ideas--the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war--are enough to build a film on.another example. during the scenes featuring the would-be warlord, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a nasty contagious disease called the "wandering sickness" going around. it turns victims into something like drunken zombies. the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease. this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought. it's a great idea and deserved its own film.similarly, wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. that was enough for its own film, too. it's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes, especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction.still, there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing. if you're at all a sci-fi buff, this is a historically important film. given menzies' background, the production and set designs are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. it's also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his "predictions". i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of george méliès' 1902 a trip to the moon (aka le voyage dans la lune). just don't expect too much from things to come.

this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules verne's "mysterious island". the sound editing is pretty bad. you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new hampshire. for those living in new engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital w. this film is full of flaws. you get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. "ok now stand up." as for the other characters. there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. the alien guy talks with a deep voice. when he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. as for the special effects, man! this was brett piper's early work for crying out loud! the creatures are good but the animation is jerky. really jerky. sort of like karl zeman animation in journey to beginning of time (1955). the special effects are imaginative. thge music is good. bottom line, this film makes equinox or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray harryhausen epic. did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? a must watch for aspiring film makers.

it was 9:30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park (a new episode). the thing is, in my country, south park airs at 10:30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, father of the pride. i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes. the first time i watched it, i found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so i thought ''holy sh*t, i have a football game early tomorrow, so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. but yesterday, i tried to give father of the pride a second chance. i find that it's a complete rip-off of the simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv-14 rating. i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. the simpsons is also a lot more violent (halloween specials) and crude. i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2, well i've got news for him: shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic. however, i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.all in all, i don't mind father of the pride. i don't hate it, but i don't like either. i've seen way better from ''the simpsons''.3.5/10

when will the hurting stop? i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again. they keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. as if people learn. the numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t.

saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. don't get me wrong, george c. scott was terrific as scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: "merry christmas to everyone!" other times i almost fell asleep.the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug. after 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all.i can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. instead of this piece of garbage, i recommend to you, the bill murray comedy scrooged. that at least, was funny...

there is only one problem with this website, you can't give a negative rating. additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie. i say he was being too nice. a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire. this is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back. after watching 5 minutes, myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining. half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny. it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more, he should go and buy a rope. and to the actors in this flick, i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again. in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence.

forgive me for stating the obvious, but some films are good and some films are bad. of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. films such as the godfather, saving private ryan, and star wars slot comfortably into the good category. at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name. occasionally however, someone produces a truly woeful film. a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. a film that is more than bad. such a film is maiden voyage.briefly, maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, scheming ship's owner. of course, there is an all american hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day.this is a production that plumbs new depths. everything about it is bad. the acting, the direction and the so-called plot are breath-takingly poor. in short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings.yes, it's that bad.i will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film. however, its dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i mean.imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard. what would you do? i don't know about you, but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea. not this guy. he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. enough said. such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team's lives.

the cast of this film contain some of new zealander's better actors, many of who i have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running new zealand soap shortland street. it's as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. imagine "under siege" meets "the love boat", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.if you are an actor, i recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.

having seen three other versions of the same film, i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to scott's rather dull and leaden performance. his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better. when scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version. even the musical version (and frankly the muppets) take on this are better executed. very disappointing.

van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film, as indeed must every single individual involved. to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish. production values are somewhere between the original series of 'crossroads' and 'prisoner cell block h'. most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. as for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable 'story' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in 'maiden voyage'. worse still, you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes, because there aren't any. an appallingly dreadful film.

i saw this on tv the other night or rather i flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when i couldn't stand watching it any longer. it was bad. really, really bad. not "so bad it's good" just flat out bad. how did it get funded? who thought this was a good idea? an actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was "save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @#$%." i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american ascents. the shooting was dullllllllllll. the action was awkward and stilted. the dialog was inane. by far the saddest thing was ship. in real life the interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well. instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls, i kid you not, they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. dumb, dumb, dumb. don't watch this movie, not even as a joke.

yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply (and badly) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there? for the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard, under siege and speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand! the acting is as wooden as the deck, the script woeful, the one liners predictable, the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time!) is there any chance of something at least half decently made, semi believable and most important original?!? no, i thought not..

what a poor excuse for new zealnd movie making. i'm ashamed to call myself a new zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv (aug 2006). the cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. the ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the usa and mexico. it has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. one of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of new zealand's south island in the background for god's sake! must have been a very cold time on the usa/mexico area! the story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new zealand/american accents just don't work. i expect the new zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. i know high school kids in new zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. goof: there is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a taco company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was american. but some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. i'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way.

having the in-laws over for the weekend? then this is the film to hasten their departure, failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging.the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship, which is more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list. an interesting piece of added amusement is playing "spot the villain" as passengers join the ship. you won't be wrong!!!! with a script that sinks faster than a brick, clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them.a must watch film, if only to laugh at how bad it is.

i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role. leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations, but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film. actor miguel núñez who played little richard in "why do fools fall in love?" was a much more suitable choice, having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona. if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well. and this is what has happened here. glossed over or missed entirely are lr's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism. what "the temptations" did so well in capturing the rise of the group, warts and all, this film misses by a wide mark.what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with "the hollywood shuffle"? he's a talented, funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort.

i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic. but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s.

this is not a good movie. it's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where. not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away. worst of all, no one bothered to tell lonette mckee she can't sing. but who cares, she's sooooo damn good looking. but i digress, nothing new here. bottom-line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens. surprise, surprise. welcome to the music business. i can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie. so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies. i don't play that! if you want to support these films by going to see them - great! if you enjoyed it - super! to each his own. but don't try to tell me it was good. pleeeease! i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors. wanna see a good african-american movie? see love jones. ray. or the color purple. those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin. why? because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater. just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film. it's only good -- when it's good. period.

about time they released this movie on dvd. i know some say wb rush the release of this movie because of the dreamgirls movie. but, how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976.i'm very disappointed with the dvd release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 dd sound. come on wb, you can do much better then this. the audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help.seem wb didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales. they could have kept the cd which by the way dose not have all the songs the original cd has. would i recommend this dvd for purchase. yes, because it is a classic film. but wb need to go add some more special feature. take notes from other group movies, the five heatbeats, or the temptation were you may view just the performance, and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this dvd.

just in time to capitalize on the long-awaited movie version of "dreamgirls" is the dvd release of this semi-forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the supremes as its inspiration. released five years before the broadway opening of "dreamgirls" and partially set in the same period, it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up-and-coming girl group, and that's where the resemblance basically ends. written by joel schumacher well before he became a big-league director of mainstream studio product ("batman forever", "the phantom of the opera"), this movie seems grittier on the surface. true to form, however, schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichés and eye-rolling one-liners. with little affinity for staging musical numbers, sam o'steen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a low-budget tv-movie with a frustratingly episodic structure.the story follows three harlem sisters - sexy sister, self-righteous delores and sweet sparkle - as they sing in the church choir, meet smooth-talking but well-intentioned boys stix and levi, and then find their first taste of success as a singing group - first as a sweater-wearing quintet called the hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as sister and the sisters. but naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group - sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer satin struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie; levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick-up for satin; stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some jewish mobsters for financial help; delores just gets plain fed up; and poor little sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants. a big plus is that r&b great curtis mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs, some catchy and one, "look into your heart", a real winner.the solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances. lonette mckee's valiant attempt to make sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham-fisted plot turns, including a sad billie holliday-like turn at the mike. before they hit it big on primetime tv, philip michael thomas and dorian harewood portray stix and levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility. the best work comes from mary alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre-"fame" irene cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role (though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene). the dvd just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice-over by dj casey kasem and a bonus cd of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by aretha franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack. it's not a terrible movie, just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as "dreamgirls".

i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.boy, was i disappointed. this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. george c. scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. the rest of the time he was quite flat.i realize that this was made in '84, pre-cg effects, for the most part. but it looked to be very b-movie quality, especially the encounter with jacob marley.the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime.i will admit that mr. scott did a good job with the "reformed" scrooge at the end. that was a refreshing portrayal.i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. and tiny tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...

this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family, but unaware of her mother's death. her sister runs the family home, but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband. frannie strongly objects to the idea, and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were, by getting a job and maintaining responsibility.in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love (as you do), and it's from this point that i sort of lost interest....there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary charlie's angel.silk hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image, and you know there was a limit to the budget, but it's not the worst film ever made. the positive aspects are there; you just have to find them.

director fred schepisi(roxanne) directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about albert einstein(matthau) trying to hook his scientific niece(ryan) up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's. to get ryan to like robbins, einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist. the idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. tim robbins, meg ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan.

tim robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einstein's niece! although he's on-screen much of the time, robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being walter matthau playing einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

when i first saw this film, i thought it should have come from the children's section - it's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering. i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. this film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didn't put me in a very good mood. but if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like i said..it should be in the children's section. einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal meg ryan's heart. a very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.

i loved dewaere in series noir. his talent is trivialized in "the waltzers" aka "going places". okay, it's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways; many folks find such behavior amusing. this was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. i find the smirk on blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. series noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior. from the first moment when we see patric dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours. when we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy depardieu in "going places" we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul-draining. i have trouble eking even a "3" for this annoying distraction.

this movie is an abomination, and its making should have been considered a capital crime.one of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. it is a tale of a really gripping mystery, nice old-fashioned romance, and dry english humor. why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant, change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product.

sadly i don't remember the book anymore, but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace. this film represents a typical german production of low quality. it does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. however there's hope ... i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.

this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie. the worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful, sophomoric, pseudo-orwellian/huxleyan/whateverian "vision" of "the human future."science fiction filmmakers (and authors), as geeks, take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre. i think other genres with a high ctgsr (yes, i just made it up, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound "message."sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level, as numerous great filmmakers have proven. but there is an immense downside to the whole concept, which is represented by "robot jox," with its low-rent construction of "the future" (lone good design element: the bizarre, slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies) and its painfully heavy-handed "iliad" parallels (he's named achilles for god's sake! i actually didn't pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time, but i went to public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.)of course, if you're a crazy movie freak like me, this downside has a great upside. i absolutely love movies like this, because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. it's kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing, i guess.note: the lead in this movie (gary graham? is that his name? i refuse to go check.) is really not that bad. he makes a go of it. he's kind of cool, especially when he's drunk/hung over.

think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as "power rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "robot jox". a movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. there are as i recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. so it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.

i actually paid to see this movie in the theater.it would get a 1-rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are okay, and there's a surprise.i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. i don't have a problem with that. unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons. but, one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap. i mean, couldn't they even make it "look" good?the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect, i might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor, but at the time, i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.thankfully, the experience was over in only 85 minutes.

uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; edward woodward, as the ghost of christmas present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins. as scrooge, george c. scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. the scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. no one else seems to be putting any effort in, except frank finlay, who chronically overacts.

ok this movie had a terrible premise. be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other. each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford. here's a better idea, lets rely on our most inept resource,jocks, to fight our battles. everyone says what about the director, what about him. he makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. there is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous i had to laugh. i actually had a good time watching it, well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin(trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it is a surprise, however lame) what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway. i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one. i am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as "manos the hands of fate."the budget does not matter either, i have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. the storyline was not even plausible and i have seen better acting in school plays. surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.anyway pick it up, it is a fun movie to watch.

there are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. the base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. the non-existent budget really killed this movie. stuart gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'honey, i shrunk the kids', which was a box office smash. however, that movie had some serious cash backing from disney. honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)

what an awful movie! the idea of robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent and special effects (on which, this type of movie must depend) are archaic. i thought it must have been made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. that's 5 years after aliens! ok, lots of people said it was good considering the low budget, but i just think 'what's the point?'. it looks totally unbelievable. i wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other.

r o b o t j o x.burn the master.grotesquely horrible.no ending; no closure.completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.replaces "the adventures of pluto nash" as the worst movie of all time.i hate this utterly unacted, unedited, unscripted, undirected, unproduced mess of a thing called "robot jox" - and i just found out - they made a second one!?!? i apologize to adma sandler (zohar the beauticin) and eddie murphy (pluto nash) for hating their movies. this mess of a thing makes those movies only bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing. this is the only movie for which i have ever said this - remove it from netflix - now!!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.

title: robot jox (1990) director: stuart gordon cast: gary graham, anne marie johnson, paul koslo review: stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re-animator, from beyond, dagon and castle freak, took a small detour here and did a little sci-fi flick. i stress the word "little" since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.the story takes place in the future. a world in which the great superpowers (that according to this movie are the united states and russia) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots. our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander. lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.well, the idea is awesome i guess. the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available. unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.i as a kid loved this movie, and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like "what the hell is this piece of crap franco?" and i'm like well this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon?" but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. i could go through it, cause i loved this film as a kid, and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. but everyone else was just not going to get it.and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good. first off. the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. but unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company (empire pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.ok granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go "thats why i liked thid movie!" but every know and them, some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. and boom, your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise.and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. this movie is basically a movie for kids. you know, giant robots duking it out? stop motion animation? hello? but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn't a good mix.so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like i do) well id suggest you steer clear away from this one. gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just didn't do it for me. well, at least not now that i'm a full grown adult.rating: 2 out of 5

this movie was, as homer simpson would have put it, "more boring than church." maybe i don't understand it well enough, and i thought it started out pretty well, but after (start of spoiler) hermann braun is sent to jail and maria starts working/sleeping with her boss it just started to drag, and i struggled to keep awake. again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (end of spoiler). in the end, i fail to see why others think it's so great, as i found it extremely boring. by the way, i did not watch this movie by my own free will, as i was required to see it for a film class.

i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the german new wave: 1) there are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to maria's abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband. how many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead?2) the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald. in the final version, however, maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.3) fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. contrary to what the critics and "experts" assert, i don't think it works. merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. the selfish ambition of maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar germany. maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. 4) lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.strangely, for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it once.

the premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that i'm a movie critic. with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. i'm a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3, and some others (many).the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong. this is a highschoolers approach to cinema. for the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. if one is a takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. it lacks any originality (see the neverending story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be miike's personality would spill over into the screen. all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography.the movie had the potential to be something great. the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. but this one seemed to have been run into the ground.my suggestion is if you're just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu, ichi, and audition. then movie into his works like blue's harp, fudoh, rainy dog, bird people of china.

ah, bait. how do i hate thee? let me count the ways. 1. you try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. instead, i want to hurl. 2. you try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like bill gates, and is about as scary as...well, bill gates. (just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. doesn't work, does it? a lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. doesn't fit.) as for jamie foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. you try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. and when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project, and i find myself nauseated, and once again i want to hurl. 4. you try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only meryl streep for company. this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.

are you familiar with concept of children's artwork? while it is not the greatest picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. if painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. well, this concept of children's artwork is how i felt about fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait. while on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. if you have seen either training day or king arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait. while foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why fuqua's name appears on so many "best of" film lists.i will never disagree with someone that fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon. even in the silly feature bait, you are witness to fuqua's greatness. two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work. alas, in the rest of this film, all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood. we have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are charlie kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel. it is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with bait. i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. i was just tired of the structure, and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it, he did not.then, there was the acting. while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor, i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral. i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral. again, i was disappointed. foxx was annoying. not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot. instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. fuqua should have stopped this immediately. foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. instead of character development, he would crack a joke. neither style worked, no joke was funny. the rest of the cast was average. by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles. they were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. they were pawns filling in dead air space. fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.overall, this was a sad film. with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. in each scene i saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. are my words harsh? i don't think so. when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. bait contained none of these. while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. apparently, i took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble.grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch)

this is listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an "american pie style comedy" it's not that either.basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. throw is a couple of dwarfs, also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls.considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity, and practically zero sex scenes, mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty.if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour, then this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this!

bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. what else can i say. kate jackson must have been desperate to direct. may be she should go back to acting...on second thought she was a bad actress to. who would put money in to producing something this bad. i like anti-christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad. the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. the special effects, if you can call them that, where laughable. i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of. we had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. this so called movies original prints should be destroyed, all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie. then those people should never be allowed to act, direct or film any thing but their own home movies.

honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! this film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line. i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from "the omen" and other movies like it. for example the nanny "lucy" in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan.....does this sound a lot like mrs. baylock to anyone else. another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted, just like in "the omen". however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body....yet another coincidence?????? and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls, much like the priest in "the omen" having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper. please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and "the omen" for you because as i've stated above there are far too many to mention here.

this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks i've seen. the length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline. also, the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous. the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure, and the dad is shot by a police officer? i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for, but it could have been better. also, the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over. after hearing all of lucy's name and figuring out it was 'lucifer', i wanted to gag. yes, it's interesting that lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. it's a male's name. it should be given to a male character. all in all, the movie was a bore, and could have used a better plot.

well, it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said. but the thing is, i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen. so, i have to write something.the acting is stupid. it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash. the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be. don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. we don't see how the granpa is killed. the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, you just don't sympathize with them. and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better. we just hear him scream and we see nothing!

what? is jamie foxx supposed to be funny?does he really believe he is funny?well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.the man has no identity whatsoever...i mean you can immediately see who his idols are, denzel washington and martin lawrence, because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.the only problem is that he does it bad, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel, with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence, the funny and clumsy-silly comic. there's no personal touch to all that, i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and i'm sure he has nothing to say personally. he really is mr. dull-boy in person.i was really hoping hollywood, and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom, like don cheadle for example, but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.

dear me... peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been. but his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents. he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did. of his later films, only "the optimists of nine elms" and "being there" have impressed me of those i have seen.that said, the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - i have yet to see "carlton browne" and "heavens above!" - at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree. but, "there's a girl in my soup" really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers' part in terms of character. in his films from 1955-64, you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. here, you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. it's almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality. he certainly does not convince, try as he might, or create an interesting character. he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant, and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy, genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy. it is very artificial seeming, all the way through - i know that it is part of danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies, but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces. sellers has a very grating way of playing "charm" as well... this character really has no depth, and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest. sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty, iconoclastic performance in "lolita".there really is nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, as frankly they leave little or no impression. this is truly one of the most anaemic, complacent, misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen. a nonentity of a "vehicle" for sellers' undisputed talents.rating:- * 1/2/*****

peter sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie hawn's youth (just after her oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud. as a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.a 3 out of 10. best performance = ? nicky henson plays a young study type.i hope hawn and sellers were paid well, because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - catch-22, m.a.s.h., husbands, joe, wusa, five easy pieces and many others). you can't win them all!

i read that "there's a girl in my soup" came out during peter sellers's low period. watching the movie, i'm not surprised. almost nothing happens in the movie. seemingly, the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie; it doesn't. the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything. maybe i haven't seen every movie about middle-aged to elderly people trying to be hippies, but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name.all in all, both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this, so don't waste your time on this. pretty worthless.

with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong. but what can i say? this was a horrible misfire. the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn. the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it. peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.that song about arabella cinderella' is pretty cool, but that is it. i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there. peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from dr. strangelove and being there throughout his career, to dumb movies like this and the magic christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. this one is senseless, and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie. not recommended for anyone.

this movie delivers. the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off.but this movie doesn't stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer. stereotypical grilling dads, several plot lines that go nowhere, and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home.

if you have plenty of time to waste ... it's ok. it moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter. the acting is ok. mariana klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable.william r. moses played a pretty good part as the husband.gail o'grady, as the wife, had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed.the ending is sort of silly. like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time.

i know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality, but this one got on my nerves. it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. the "psycho mom" thing has been done too many times before (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well. the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.one highlight: i am a long-time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular, jon lindstrom.anyway, if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it, in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie might be tolerable. if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards.i'm sorry i spent my time watching it.

this really doesn't match up to castle of cagliostro. lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. the scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting. the only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by fujiko. it helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. coc had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. the locations in tsotg are not very vivid or engaging. zenigata, goemon and jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. it's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. the dvd is in full-frame with dolby stereo sound. it has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. but one curious thing. there is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.

the waterdance (1991) the main character of the waterdance, played by eric stoltz, finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured. and there he must face an harsh new life, confined to a wheelchair. it's an interesting, and promising premise, but unfortunately, it fails to deploy. what ensues instead is largely hollywood schmaltz, with some interesting moments. certainly the cast (eric stoltz, william forsythe, wesley snipes, et al) is brilliant, and perform well here as one would expect, but their talents are wasted. the characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another, and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable (the snipes character being the exception). i suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being "crippled" or "weak", by depicting them, for the most part, as in-your-face pricks, but it makes for an entirely annoying experience. admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through, in a way that is not softened or romanticized, which is useful, and a good idea, but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with, and that's worth dealing with, it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be, to varying degrees, despicable. they wouldn't have to be disneyfied, either; surely there's a middle ground somewhere. by the film's conclusion, the eric stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person, but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end, we couldn't care less. in addition to its character problems, the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many hollywood movies suffer from; the syndrome doesn't really have an official name, but you might call it "inexplicable forgiveness syndrome". it goes something like this: characters abuse the crap out of each other, and then without so much as an apology, all is forgiven (an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie the breakfast club, in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot; as a resultthey love him. in one of the the latest examples, spiderman 3, supervillain the sandman lays waste to a chunk of manhattan, then wails on spiderman for what seems like about 15 monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to "bye, now"). the most egregious example of ifs in the waterdance is a sequence in which, after being called the n-word by william forsythe's racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene, the wesley snipes character whoops it up with the same forsythe character in the next scene, as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence. again, without so much as an "oh yeah, sorry about that business back there where i, you know, called you the n-word". it makes me wonder, do these people actually watch these movies before they release them, or do they just film them with their eyes closed, kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number, and call it a day's work?

this story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a previously-viewed vhs sight-unseen. that was a mistake.in what could have been a very nice story - about badly crippled people at a hospital, and their various personalities - turned quickly into a very profane soap opera with unlikeable characters.we have "bloss" (william forsythe) the stereotype racist white person, who says the f-word every other sentence and is so despicable they didn't give him a first name in the movie. he's a lot of fun to be around. then, there is "raymond hill" (wesley snipes), a fast-talking womanizer. snipes must have liked those fast-talking "hip" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, like in "white men can't jump." then there is sweet helen hunt playing "anna" that wonderful caring, loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film, "joel garcia" (eric stoltz).yup, this is heartwarming, feel-good type stuff. it just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks. but, if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy film.....you might really like this! add in a dose of hollywood political correctness and there you go! what more could anyone want?

to summarize this movie: without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes. the music is just awful, the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. it seems to me, that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks. also, the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies, other than a few names and mr. levenstein who is a minor character in this one. the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls. don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2.

i have to say that i used to be a huge fan of the series. the first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new beta house is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse. i know they are made for dvd films but some effort would be nice.there are no laughs, just a couple of good one-liners that will bring a smile if that. there is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks. but neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work.to add to all that this is a racist film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist. i am not one of those people who think everything should be politically correct. but the portrayal of minorities is very offensive.i wouldn't waste any time on this garbage. see the previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.

this movie masquerades as a social commentary, when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. the premise of this movie: african-american = strong... any other race = weak. the worst part is when rapaport pulls a gun on omar epps and a jewish guy. the jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big, strong, defiant omar epps stands strong with no fear. we also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. the raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all. when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. wait... busta rhymes beat up a guy twice his size??? yeah, right.of course the black men never reject their own people and omar epps moves in with them easily. the scenes where ice cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. this movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud. the overly long slow-motion between epps and banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other (and they're all under 5). do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.

the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy. seen in that light, it does deliver. if you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of "issues" with no insight whatsoever.making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable, stereotypical ways. busta rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable, and michael rappaport turns in a good performance, but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite, it's hard to find anything redeeming.

somehow they summed up the 60's, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. and what a painful four hours it was. they trivilized the major events and happenings and they "claimed" it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. what was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country. and the second family was such a non-factor. they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. that poor son... please nbc, do not make any movies about any other eras....leave that to pbs and the history channel

even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s (ok, so katie didn't join the manson family, and nobody died at altamont), this movie was still unbelievably awful. i got the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in a room and watched "forrest gump," "the wonder years," and oliver stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research. a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning". he was right.

the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. it is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. if done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time. i'm glad i watched this in class, and not on my own time. i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music. those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. i hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.

i like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana , n.w.a , public enemy , soundgarden etc .the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it .see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project

the characters are cliched and predictable, with everyone being either snow-white pure or wholly evil. the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing, over-the-top way. it's doubly disappointing if you're a bette davis fan, because her character is not a typically fun bette-davis-type character; she just gets to frown pensively a lot.on the whole, neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.

lillian hellman's play, adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman, becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros. paul lukas, reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar, plays an anti-nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists, dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states (via the mexico border). they settle in washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker. it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest, direct refugees teaching the clueless, head-in-the-sand americans how the world has suddenly changed), it seems a little patronizing--the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place, being lectured to. lukas has several speeches in the third-act which undoubtedly won him the academy award, yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit, enter and exit. as his spouse, bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage, but the role doesn't allow her much color. their children (all with divergent accents!) are alternately humorous and annoying, and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put-upon wife (and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong). the intent here was to tastefully, tactfully show us just because a (wwii-era) man may be german, that doesn't make him a nazi sympathizer. we get that in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactful movie is made up of exposition, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. it should be a heady mix, but instead it's rather dry-eyed and inert. ** from ****

i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel. "i'm thinking matrix, i'm thinking bladerunner, i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her, leave that one with us. only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike. fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?"flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. sf just the way joe fanboy likes it, in fact. :(

wow, here it finally is; the action "movie" without action. in a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly "matrix" without having the money to do it right. yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.and, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. in fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money.

god, i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot. i had been expecting a lot from it, as i'm a huge fan of james cameron (and not just since "titanic", i might add), and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality (then again, he also wrote the leaden strange days..). but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. in all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. on top of that, i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular "a-team" episode. as for alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her "gal wit an attitude" schtick pretty soon. you can count me out of this one, mr. cameron!

awful, simply awful. it proves my theory about "star power." this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed (battlestar) titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick. b o r i n g.find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound. 1/10 (i rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb.com rating system.)-zaphoidps: my theory about "star power" is: the more "star power" used in a show, the weaker the show is. (it's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1/"star power", less "sp" makes for better quality, etc. another way to look at it is: "more is less.")-z

poor robert englund makes another flop and to the expense of tobe hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one. englund plays the well known marque de sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain. the story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and i became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. all i saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this arabian with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the madam momoselle(spelled that wrong) or whoever it was in the picture above de sades wall. the movie was terrible, i am surprised at hooper for hireing englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes. englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move "nightmare on elm st." by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes. terrible, absolutely terrible.

this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad. and indeed, we couldn't take most of it. there was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). cripes. i've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (i'm estimating forty or so). and i've never laughed so hard in my life. you see, englund has this thing for showing off his loins. i last saw the film a couple months ago, but i can't stop laughing as i type. anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. this is absolute genius. you've got to see it for yourself.

tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer. like any other horror fan, i loved the texas chainsaw, but i think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie. i can't really think of any other movie hooper has done (on his own, don't count poltergeist) that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world. and this movie, night terrors, just backs up my point.poor robert englund, i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given. he did what he could. as for the movie itself? pure drudge. unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been penned in an our, and really just awful scenery, music, and cinematography. nothing in this film is redeemable. don't waste your time.overall, 1 out of 10. i feel sorry for hooper, his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started. i hope that he's able to pump out at least one more good flick, that way he can do his cult status some justice.

genie (zoe trilling) arrives in egypt to visit her hypocritical, bible-quoting archeologist father (william finley) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the marquis de sade (robert englund). englund also plays de sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. genie is led astray by mohammed (juliano merr), who rides around naked on a horse and sabina (alona kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking, which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers, a woman simulating oral sex on a snake, an orgy and her father preaching in the background! meanwhile, black hooded cult members decapitate, gouge out eyeballs and slit throats. when genie is slipped drugs in her tea, she imagines de sade hanging from a cross, a gold-painted woman in a leafy g-string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes. it's all because she's the reincarnation of de sade's lost love.this typically sleazy harry alan towers production is redundant, seedy and pretty senseless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there's always something going on.score: 3 out of 10

the marquis de sade, egypt, ancient gnostic cults, robert englund in a dual role, gratuitous sex and nudity, murder and mayhem... on paper tobe hopper's night terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, entertaining flick given the ingredients. it's not. it is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. there is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of de sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local christian archaeologist and kill her. that is pretty much it- i think it has something to with the gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut with scenes of englund as the imprisoned de sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. it seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.there aren't too many good points. robert englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, zoe trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching night terrors is a chore. at least i got to see the movie from which the "when you're as criminal as i" bit from the australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many vhs tapes from the nineties came from.

what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. during the first season, dark angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of jessica alba.unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to "fine-tune" the plotline. within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see jessica alba!). i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. on one of the second season episodes, they even had max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.the moral of the story (the one that hollywood never gets): if it works, don't screw with it!azjazz

i don't know much about tobe hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he shouldn't have bothered. as another commenter mentioned, there isn't really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre. the plot is incoherent, the sade sequences are gratuitous, and most of the acting is so-so. englund was doing his best with weak material, and zoe trilling has a really great bottom, but neither is enough to carry this film. this one's a tape-over. grade: f

if i had realized john wayne was in this movie, i would not have watched it. it's demeaning to the japanese, unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person. but then, most john wayne movies are like that. hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan. maybe it's hollywood that should be isolated.to put it as succinctly as possible, this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap.(sort of a madama butterfly with bad music.)

there are often badly-matched couples (in the general sense of the term) -in huston's movies :"african queen" "heaven knows mister allison" "roots of heaven" "misfits" ..."the barbarian and the geisha" (check the title) is another good example,so to speak.it seems that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as "sayonara" " the world of suzie wong" and "the teahouse of the august moon" bear witness. huston's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot(with the exception of "susie " maybe).john wayne perfectly fits in ford's world ,in huston's he's like a bull in a china shop.his japanese partner is totally bland.even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom.only those utterly enamoured of huston's every work need to choose this ,among all his other great movies around.

this is is a thoroughly unpleasant, if slickly made, movie. i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. the movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. what we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which is supposed, evidently, to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way. goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can. burt reynolds does a cameo. the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop, but i somehow missed them (good move on their part). the whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; an heir, i suspect, to the style of 'pulp fiction', 'fargo' and 'natural born killers'. if you liked those, you'll probably like this.

vic (richard dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. how can a director have a cast with richard dreyfuss, ellen barkin, jeff goldblum, diane lane (very gorgeous), gabriel byrne, gregory hines, kyle maclachlan, burt reynolds, billy idol and a make such a waste of time? this movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in the cast. my vote is four.title (brazil):' prazer em matar-te!' ('pleasure in killing you!')

dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed." lane is his girl who's been messing around with his number one (goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with lane's sister (barkin).with what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (burt reynolds, gabriel byrne, kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor) can't help this plot, as dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight.you know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out, but i'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie.the actual reason i picked this movie is because i've been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. the real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film. the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on.3 out of 10 stars.

"mad dog time"..."trigger happy" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like gangster comedies ( as i thought oscar , johney dangerously and mafia also sucked ) it's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all out comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )make it out to be. the rick , mick , vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. there wasn't enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in. the majority of the film was either set in "dreyfus's club" or a variety of offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning ?) the supporting cast was... on paper excellent ( great to see silva & drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and richard pryors cameo was a joke ! the romance and love element of the film also bogged it down.4/10 i don't think i'll return to it anytime soon.

so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert's book "i hated, hated, hated this movie" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review "mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor". so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert's review of rob reiner's "north" where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don't think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. but above all the other things that were awful about this "movie" i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss's girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill. haha. not funny. then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra's "my way" sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss. of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die. are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny. not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss (who i admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that "independence day" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. did goldblum feel that "independence day" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if "independence day" were a bomb? what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? the opening sequence of "mad dog time" says that the movie is set on another planet. i only wish now that i have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that i will never get back. ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid. every copy of "mad dog time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.

wowwwwww, about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie!!! i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better. or at least have some redeeming qualities, like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie, or like really intelligent, or very well filmed or something...needless to say, that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life. im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilers"...imdb, you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that. i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings...all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie... im still a big imdb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.

seriously what the hell was this movie about,,simply stupid,,i'd give it 0 but,,,1"awful" is the lowest you can go,,seriously this movie is not worth watching,,waste of time, i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10,,i seriously can make a better movie than this , hire some other unemployed people,,'n i promise i'll make a movie better than this,,this movie was so bad,,that i'll never watch a movie starring steve carrel again,bottom line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it,,i'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second

i have a 5 minute rule (sometimes i'll leave leway for 10). if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better. i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory. dan in real life is definitely no exception. i was watching this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and i don't like any of the characters at all.the story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. i suppose the tagline would be "advice columnist who could use advice"? i don't know. dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. i guess that's the irony? i don't know. he goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and potential fodder for good comedy, story lines...none which ever emerge. the central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can't have her. anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her, but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny, trite, lifetime movie network dialogue "murderer of love" to get to the inevitable happy ending.this is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

the fact that there are positive comments about dan in real life on the imdb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.i have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film i sat through last night - dan in real life. steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that i would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters i felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.the dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter walton's family and the film has been so many times before that i am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the imdb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a good film.

spoiler: bunch of passive-aggressive people having family reunion. the script has them saying and doing things people would never do, at least anyone with a shred of decency. the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion, unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion. he tries to defer to his brother's claim, but she, knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper, rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch. at one point, she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him. he tries to cover his eyes. his heart is breaking. she thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion.the movie really drags. the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul. the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. we almost walked out, but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up, but nooooo. all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this. comparing it to little miss sunshine??? jeez. shame on them, the writers, the actors, the producers, and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen!

oh dear. this movie could have been sub-titled "when writers go on strike!" what a stinker. i had really high hopes for this, mostly after reading imdb reviews, which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system, but that's a separate matter. i loved steve carrell in anchorman, bruce almighty, the office, etc so i was expecting great things. to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year. there are so many things wrong with this movie, but i'll confine myself to (a) the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do (a mass aerobics workout? what planet is that real life on?), the clunky script (a murderer of love? please), and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable, you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue, creaking direction, ridiculous set-scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents, who don't get out much and don't like to waste money. unlike the makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire - that would have been more entertaining. if you like movies, avoid this like the plague.

if, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you don't realize that the main character, who writes a life advice column, is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself, then there is probably something wrong with you. the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isn't) there's almost no chemistry between the leads, and steve carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. it's hard to believe binoche's character would have any interest in him. then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. isn't that great america!

expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie, after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman, the 40 year-old virgin, and little miss sunshine. boy, was i wrong.i'll start with what is right with this movie: at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell. there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing. he's an undoubtedly talented individual, and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck.with that out of the way, i'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.the film begins with dan burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column. he prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie. no family behaves like this. it's almost as if they've been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver. they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7. it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating. touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling, and talent shows are not how actual people behave. it's almost sickening.another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for. observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded.it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet. i left the theater wondering what i just saw. after thinking further, i don't think it was much.

-might contain spoilers... but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish.i walked into this movie with high expectations. it was my own fault. i had put too much stock in steve carell's record to date. 40 year old virgin... little miss sunshine... the office. and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. it's always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely off lately. the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching "blue steel" in 1990.this flick fumbled from start to finish. the script was flunky material. awful writing all around. "murderer of love"? "love is an ability"? whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beauty's writer(s)... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard. the entire flick was peppered with three's company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene. or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene. or the awful laundry room scene. right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen, they toss in one of these terrible moments. and it happens over and over and over again.and what's with carell's character? the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? let's face it. their conversation sucked. they both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes. pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie.... carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny (i think the exact line was "this one time when i was a kid"... that's it. seriously), but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses. the actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing.back to the imdb thing... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. i know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio. check out the family stone's rating... if that's a mid 5, then this absolutely has got to be a 2... and that's pushing it.

this movie is supposed to be a "lighthearted" tale about santa claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. but instead it comes off as being downright creepy. two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1) the way santa looks.- have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus? and 2) the "evil rep. of satan" pitch's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch. only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh. i can't believe this is a children's movie.

this is kind of a weird movie, given that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against satan and his minions...but it's still kinda fun.it has some genuine laughs...whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable, though. this movie is not good, but i can say i really enjoyed watching it.i would recommend this movie over "santa claus conquers the martians", "santa claus" with dudley moore and john lithgow, or "the santa clause" with tim allen.

believe it or don't, i have my very own dvd copy of this "movie" which i bought at walgreens for a great big whole dollar. i'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.pretty amazing set designs and costumes. apparently much thought and effort went into their making. the set designs are very mexican in stylization. i liked them a lot. and santa is impressive. one of the more impressive santas in moviedom.i'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. but, somehow, it comes across quite deranged. in fact, i'm left stunned at how deranged it is.maybe it's the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre. one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness. the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very, very weird.did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? you didn't? neither did i until i watched this movie. one learns something new everyday.is this movie actually worth watching? now, that's a tossup. i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. yet, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. you decide what you're going to do. i dunno... for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves. now, that's just wrong...

hobgoblins....hobgoblins....where do i begin?!?this film gives manos - the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made. this one is fun to laugh at, where as manos was just painful to watch. hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze". the acting (and i am using this term loosely) is atrocious, the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see, and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed. the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k, and that version is the only way to watch this mess. this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done. if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the bots.....god help you!!

this rip off of the 1984 hit "gremlins" is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made. even for a 'b' grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting, and goodness.it begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance. why? because a few minutes into the film he walks into the 'forbidden' safe, and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub.this is just an appetizer for the scat-filled main course. the main character, kevin, struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy. perhaps he succeeds within the film, but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor. kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard, and is guided through his security shift in the (wait for it) abandoned studio lot. yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself. back to the film. kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the hobgoblins. the hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. they must be returned before sunrise or else...or else what? exactly.other characters include kevin's 'macho' army friend nick, nick's 'woman' daphne whose character has no more substance than a bitch-slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits. there is kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend amy, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed cher look-alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top.. don't ask me how that works. quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is kyle. how such groups of friends are made is up for question. kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self-stimulating. his hobbies include calling up sex-chat lines from other people's houses and most likely sniffing underwear.the story unfolds as the heroes search for the hobgoblins: knee-high creatures (aka. hand puppets) which, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood. each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars... or the film having a big budget.warning spoilers ahead: the twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering "what?". the hobgoblins are returned to the safe by...their own free will. perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc, or perhaps the story-writers got writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending. upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "what he learned in the military" and detonates explosives which destroys the safe, signaling the end of the evil hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride; better fitted to a ride on an escalator.the sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears. if you plan to watch it, i recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind.

no matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.if you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.if you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.if it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a b**ch!if you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.as you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining. as mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a gremlins type movie. this however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. critters looked pretty good, so did the ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the munchies looked better than these. the characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. the hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. at one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. i like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. give me a break, i am 25 and i look younger than any of them.

so there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's kevin, the world's biggest wuss. kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virginal girlfriend amy. as he returns from work to... a random house... he finds his "friends," the sexually confusing red-shorted kyle and the truly revolting sluttish daphne. they are soon joined by daphne's boyfriend, the trigger-happy sex-crazed macho lunkhead nick. and there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire. kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- i mean nightclub. kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks. amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire. along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song. the hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up. "citizen kane" cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of american cinema.

i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie. it was so terribly stupid and unfunny that i just couldn't sit through it--though i tried.the biggest problem with this and any mel brooks movie i call "the mel quotient". in other words, the better his movie, the less of him you see in the film. think about it--the producers and young frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all. but, films like life stinks and space balls are chock full of mel and are pretty dopey movies (yes, i did not like space balls--but this isn't the place to talk about that).second, apart from cancer, rectal itch and mental retardation, i can't think of a less funny topic than homelessness. this is just a comedy breaker. think about it, folks. the funniest(?) scene in the movie has mel making whoopee with leslie ann warren in a dumpster!! and this is funny in what way?

i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness. of course, brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often. brooks' movies have become worse and worse over the years. this is just another nail in the coffin .

whenever i make up a list of the absolute worst movies i've ever seen, this movie is always on it. it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. it took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and i would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again.what's wrong with it? let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater.i went to a midnight show, on a saturday night. i the only ones in the theater were myself, and a bunch of loud, boisterous, rather unruly teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. they were obviously out having a good time on a saturday night, and had come to this "comedy" for some laughs. before the movie starts, during the previews, they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time. it was borderline annoying; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie, i might've said something, but i was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun, so i let it go. and they did settle down once the movie started.why am i telling you all this? because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect it had not just on myself, but on this rowdy bunch.during the entire run of the film, not one person in the theater laughed. not once. not myself, not the boisterous kids. absolute silence, aside from the soundtrack. and when the film was over and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly filed out of the theater in slow, somber, absolute silence. it could've been a funeral.this was the effect that this "comedy" produced. not laughter, not enjoyment, but absolute depression. it was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the tiniest bit funny. preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny.i consider mel brooks' "blazing saddles" to be on the short list for funniest movie ever. it still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the least funny movie ever.in short: if you're feeling too happy, give this movie a whirl; otherwise, don't say i didn't warn you.

woody allen made "september", proving that even a genius could screw up. this is mel brook's "september". monumentally stupid, boring, and unfunny, i must confess i did not watch it through to the end. the flick ranks among the dishonored few (e.g., "the money pit", "out to sea", "spitfire grill") which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the "rewind" button. and i say this, sadly, as a devoted mel brooks fan. he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. how the same fellow that made "young frankenstein" and "spaceballs" could crank out a dog like this is beyond me. to be avoided at all costs.

another chapter in the ongoing question, whatever happened to mel brooks's sense of humor? it starts out nicely enough, with mel as trump-like mogul goddard bolt ("you can call me god"), who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days. but the moment the movie hits the streets, it turns into a pathos-laden mess, with occasional "funny" bits interjected (mel sees a black kid break-dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck-and-wing, yuk, yuk). leslie ann warren is nothing short of wasted. the worst part is this movie's musical number, in which brooks and warren do a silent dance to cole porter's "easy to love." brooks's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies; here he plays the whole thing straight, like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on "the carol burnett show" (on which rudy deluca, this film's co-writer, began his career). go rent charlie chaplin's the kid, which covered the same ground 70 years before and did a lot

this movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good. i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. the book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it. toni collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up. i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scary.the acting is pretty good and toni collette's performance was awesome as well as robin williams. the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd.

i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies, as i like to see what other people think of the movie. i read many reviews which said 'thriller not a horror movie'. this prompted me to give this film a try. i really must take issue with these 'thriller/horror' statements, as it was neither! i almost went and asked for my money back, and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish....well you must be easily pleased! at the end of the movie, the people behind me said out loud "what a waste of time" and i turned to them and replied " i couldn't have summed it up better". i kept waiting for something to happen...but it didn't. there was the potential for a lot of good scares (or thrills if you like) but none happened. williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere. save your money folks, this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store 'bargain box' near you in the very foreseeable future!

i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.why i didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say. i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately!! several people in our theater did and sadly i didn't follow them out.the story lacked all criteria for a movie. no plot. awful acting! even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in. not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk. i did like the tazer scene. too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot. someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film!

let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this. normally i enjoy robin williams movies, however this gem was not one of them. it was billed as a suspenseful thriller. the night listener was anything but. to be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day, 2 walked out, for good reason. the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed. the acting was alright but again there wasn't anything to work with. the movie is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid. however *insert spooky here* no one can verify the kids existence. so williams goes to wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker. there thats it, thats all. you wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends. it had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit. the homosexual undertones, or overtones had really nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense. in conclusion i really can't write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it, it was as captivating as watching paint dry. i gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasn't directed by uwe boll.

this movie is a mess. i'm surprised it even has a theatrical release. without robin williams it would have gone straight to video. it is poorly written. it is poorly directed. it's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic.especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience i saw it with was laughing at it. save your money. the trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring.

trying to compare or represent this "swill" as anything "hitchcockian" is an out-n-out attempt to mislead hitchcock fans to waste $7 on this movie... weak acting weak story weak script. no real suspense, no thrills. you wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff...you're left thinking, what the heck was that all about.and please, enough with the movement to make "alternative lifestyles" hip and politically correct!!...i can't recommend this to anyone...did i mention how weak the acting is? williams did a better job as peter pan and "mork". but those were much more innocent times...........

i rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time felt complied to. night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seen.there was nothing happening in this film what so ever - i didn't care for any of the characters, didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot, didn't care how it ended....nothing.there is no comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, nothing. the highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn.i really enjoyed "one hour photo" and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams, but alas was sorely let down. what's more disappointing is that i'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere - the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me.i might even have given it 1/10 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers

most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold true.but .... if i have to sit through a movie were the:directordirector of photographyeditorcan't even miss the darn microphone boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie, how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when i'm reminded of the technicalities of making a movie!!!!!!!wait for the dvd or don't bother

my husband is a huge robin williams fan. i like him too, but have generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedic roles. my thoughts were confirmed with this movie. i was completely bored throughout the entire film. the story was predictable. i realize it was inspired by a true story. but, my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story. none of the characters were well developed. there was a side story about the main character and his partner. this relationship could have been explored further. more important, though, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into. she obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way. if my husband wasn't such a huge williams fan, we would have left 20 minutes into it. too bad i can't get my $20 or 2 hours back.

i felt that the movie was dry... very disappointing no plot..kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone.. a wast of money.. one of robins williams worst films..if you don't believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over... this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that!. plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it.... this was on a friday night the 9:50 showing. i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake. when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying..

robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members. however, the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a "must see." i think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel noon(i had to spell it this way, because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to "no one") character. the movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, noon begins his search for pete logande, the boy caller.this happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. the conversations aren't too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you... i'm in the hospital...why did you boyfriend move out... etc. in the book, the kid almost becomes noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax.in the movie, noon becomes obsessed with finding logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller, why bother? who cares if the caller doesn't exist? i know there's a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. since it doesn't, the movie falls apart.this is surprising because of maupin's other work, tales of the city. when it was made into a mini-series, it worked beautifully.

i didn't really expect much from "the night listener" and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore. however, the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension. on occasion it drags a little, but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly: when. as the movie progresses, the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of "cat and mouse" spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no-one seemed to have ever seen in person. the night listener is an interesting story, which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real. however, in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had. it doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been helpful and interesting.

this movie is trash-poor. it has horrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment. direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out-of-place. not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story. to start, williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting. what's worse, his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device. you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting "d_ck_smker" - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character. finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end. toni collete's character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction. very miss-able.

i couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons: robin williams and toni collete. the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on. robin williams plays gabriel noon, a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues: his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block. one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named pete boland (rory culkin). pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. he lives with his adopted mother and social worker, donna boland (toni collette). gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete, but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist. i won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil the film, but i will tell you this: it is quite predictable. fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette, who i thought was the film's key character. collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses. her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar (hell, i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better). the film starts off as a psychological thriller, but a predictable one at that. if your curious to know the film's ending and twists, then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called "hide and seek".

felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. it's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. marginally, boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much. boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. the strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. apart from boris, the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. at a guess i think it's edgar allen poe's 'house of usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished article.still, there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!

"house of evil" aka "dance of death" of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibánez. unlike "snake people" (1971), "the incredible invasion" (also 1971) and "the fear chamber" (1972) which were all released after karloff's death in 1969, "house of evil" was released in 1968, when karloff was still alive. "house of evil" is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies, which are without doubt all rather crappy, but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are. i personally prefer "the fear chamber" and "house of evil" over the other two, simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme, and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies, the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor.the odd story (i don't know if i can really call it a 'plot') is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century. after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out, mathias morteval (karloff), an enthusiastic organ player, invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion, which is full of eerie toys. his kinfolk includes lucy durant (julissa), who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders.i won't give away more of the story, but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie. there are some very funny moments, especially some things karloff's character says. boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived, and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness, and although (or because) his role is (due to a poor script and and directing) in no way scary, it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor. just like in the movie's successors "snake people" and "the fear chamber", the female lead is once again played by julissa. most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish, the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt. the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense. it is the poor story and dialogue, however, that makes this movie so entertaining to watch. "house of evil" may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie, but it is certainly as (unintentionally) funny as it is bad. fans of ed wood's movies should be very amused, i personally found it hilarious. crappy but entertaining nevertheless, and definitely worth watching since there's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor. 3/10

boris karloff is matthias morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in morhenge mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend, "don't try to doctor me, doctor! i'm disgustingly healthy!" he invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?)***spoilers***morteval/karloff ends up dying, and murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) start killing off the relatives. a mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face, a life-sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing sheik stabs people with a knife. one guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces. at the end, julissa and her boyfriend find karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room. he plays the recurring organ theme music (sort of a death rattle used for the killings), the brother's spirit starts talking ("the whole house will go with me!") and the mansion goes up in flames.this senseless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.

mr. vanhook took a good idea and kicked like a football. unfortunately, it didn't make the goal. the historical subject of giants is a good one, but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese. i say, take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff. i couldn't even watch the entire film. that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie. i always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption. it's impossible to redeem something this bad. well, at least the acting was good....not! the only thing "falling" in this film is the rating. 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers!

an archaeologist (casper van dien) stumbles accidentally upon an ancient, 40 foot mummy, well preserved underground in the nevada desert. they are determined to keep this a secret and call in a jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it. the mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in "those days". in order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything, he mummifies his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to awaken him years from then. in our present, the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place. most of the movie is slow, having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy, air-punching fights. the mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough. it should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so... eh. don't bother.

...from this awful movie! there are so many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst. the music! i noted that the film has two composers listed. this must be the reason why every single frame has music, of the absolute worst "d" movie style drivel. they have never heard of the expression "less is more". it got so painful to listen to, i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was that good. you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley, i'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers. see it at your own risk.

i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park. it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup. the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in "on deadly ground" as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear. what robert wagner, tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing. on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies. beware and be safe avoid at all costs.

i came into this movie really wanting to line it. i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. don't get me wrong here, i wasn't expecting citizen kane, i was taking this for the b movie that it is. that said, it still fell short of the expectation. the historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. the acting in the movie was very wooden. all in all i give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. is it worth seeing? i didn't wish for my two hours back, but i don't know that i'd recommend it to others.

the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher (casper van dien) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant, now there's something you don't see everyday. matt is working for property developer morton (robert wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist angela (kristen miller) for reasons i'm unsure of. anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing, morton calls in security guy ammon (navid negahban) to handle the situation. meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt (tom bosley) translates some ancient text (as he would) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the fallen one, or something like that. it's up to matt to save the day & the whole planet...written & directed by kevin vanhook, who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start, i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that. there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical & conceptual level, the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense & it doesn't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live. the character's are awful & as clichéd as you like, the dialogue is bad as in very, very bad & the entire film is predictable, i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it? it's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state. this is bad, very bad. you have been warned.director vanhook doesn't impress, the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple? they look naff. to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour, there are also some normal sized mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy (1999), unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief. the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it, actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is. forget about any scares, tension or atmosphere & don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any.technically the fallen ones isn't anything special & apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there's little her to get excited about. the ghost cgi & water effects are terrible, it was made-for-tv & it's shows. the acting was poor, wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of dien & bosley can get these days.the fallen ones is a bad film, there's no two ways about it as far as i'm concerned. not recommended on any level or in any way, one to avoid.

i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb, but i went to see it anyway, because i am a big fan of bible related material. first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like casper van dien didn't see those jones movies through (but he should). i believe he tried his best, but script just stunk. music tried to be kinda jones style too. great work, but for such movie it seemed like too much work, like the video part did't deserve all that great music. robert wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was bringing everything down. "jokes" are old school, somewhere 20 years old; they brought only cynic smile to my face. there are some really bad camera angels, sfx looks like homemade and unrealistic. kevin vanhook had probably a good idea on the story (in my opinion, but i love such stories), but things just didn't work out in the end. maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head. when i (in first minutes) saw that movie was going to be one of those 'low budget movies', i hoped that i will at least 'hear' a good story, but sometimes movies just disappoint.

some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth, decided to disregard what he'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans. reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall, is beyond ridiculous. there was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world, that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans. these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human, somewhat supporting the "david and goliath" tale from the bible. there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being. if i was rating this movie on my own scale, it would have been a negative value instead of a one...

"the fallen ones" falls under the waste of life (wol) category. i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained. my other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy. i felt sorry for the actors (wagner). i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on tv without any loss of plot. it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all. in my humble opinion, the 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want dna samples for evil reasons. the heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges. later after everything was screwed up by the evil people. the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.

what a piece of junk this movie was. the premise was okay, but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people (even the effects in hercules was better) i knew this would be bad. but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs. it's completely incoherent, silly and stupid. i felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a d-. i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie through.i've had my share of cheesy and bad movies (i love the tremors series), but this... i do not recommend it at all. it's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe.

there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. i'm not saying they're not good actors, i'm saying they stunk in this film. the special effects were decent (and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but it even has several major flaws. for instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.don't get me wrong, i love the story of the real titanic, but i find this movie an insult to that story. editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of maybe a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted (and not just the "my heart will go on" song either). there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. that could very well be the highlight of the film. as for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. i was more relieved than sad when jack died, which i know cannot be what the director intended.in a nut shell, i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.

i, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97. it was a below average film at best, defiantly not the "masterpiece" that all these "titanic" fanboys like to make it out as. first off, dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. people just like him because of his looks. his acting "skills" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they're on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. anyone with an iq above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever. nor is it original. plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. i could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. in conclusion, "titanic" is the most overrated movie to date. why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.

i see people writing about how great this movie was. it was horrible! the acting was sub-par at best. it made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of leonardo. where the hell did they get the money? anyway, i wanted to learn more about the titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? no, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).i did cry in during one scene, though. the scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. it looked like pool water! i'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. just ridiculous. this was the worst movie until pearl harbor outdid it in the "nothing to do with reality" department.

first of all, as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic clubs, i feel entitled to comment on the film. i don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one. i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. i almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. is this an intelligent film? ask yourself.

if you ever hear these three words uttered to you..."joe don baker", be afraid...final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo (pronounced as heronimo). he's an ugly, slimy, rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas. his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. very bad editing. joe don baker (geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west. i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta (who looks like elaine from seinfeld) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck. she must be insane!the strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women. well, at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something. the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and i was happy it was finally over. you'll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movie.it's so hard to imagine how he was in three bond movies...very weird! anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on mst3k sometime. also, i've heard his other bad movie (among many), "mitchell" mst3k version is being released on dvd by rhino. i can't wait to see that!

human pot roast joe don baker (mitchell) stars in this dull, unremarkable `action' movie as deputy geronimo, a fat, gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. meanwhile, a vaguely criminal guy named palermo (played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci's gates of hell) stumbles into joe don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene. joe don- slowly- gives chase and offs palermo's brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase `it's your move. think you can take me? well, go ahead on'. for some reason joe don, a texas lawman, must transport palermo to italy (`mr. palermo's been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government,' says mr. wilson, another vague character played by bill mckinney, who was in master ninja 1, she freak, and a lot of good clint eastwood movies). anyhoo, joe don's plane must land on the island of malta, where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz. and that's where the movie grinds to a halt. for the rest of the movie, joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. then joe don keeps looking for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. then joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. this is one aggravating movie.at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea. all the other characters wonder if he's dead or not, finally concluding that he is. but then he shows up (he was rescued by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. even his cute, julia louise-dreyfuss-esque sidekick doesn't welcome him back. she does, however, offer to help him find palermo, so joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more.highpoints include, a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats, some sexy strippers, a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes, a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk, and any scene without joe don. lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger.it should be noted that this is from greydon clark, director of angel's revenge, who appears as the sheriff. ick!

while not as bad as it has been made to be (i have seen much worse), this is still a very lame movie. basically a rehash of siegel's "coogan's bluff", with the main difference being that clint eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker, an unappealing actor if there was one.however, venantino venantini is great (and great fun) as the bad guy, sort of a budget vittorio gassman. he is the main reason to sit through this steampile, as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting, specially the girl. poor old rossano brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic lead (watch "mondo cane" to see him running away from women). looking here like a second-tier ben gazzara, he's given next to nothing to do. it's all joe don's show, unfortunately. and all of it scored to generic 80's "action movie" music that couldn't be more boring.greydon clark can make good b-movies ("without warning"), but here he trips, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. well, at least the malta locations were nice, and there's venantini to try to save the day. 3/10.

i notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the mst3k airing. that's fair enough (that is, after all, how it got its widest exposure), but, having had the misfortune of seeing "final justice" in its original form, i'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version.first off, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the mst3k broadcast, owing primarily to an expository scene between rossano brazzi and venantino venantini (i could use the characters' names instead of the actors', but i just love typing the words "venantino venantini"), explaining why venantini's fugitive character can't just leave malta right away. (it's not a very convincing plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs, i don't know.another plot point missing in the original: the stripper's betrayal of venantino venantini to joe don baker, seemingly unmotivated in the mst3k version, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which venantini rapes her in the shower. while this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really...icky. (there's no other word for it.)some of the mst-worthy moments (the perpetual truncated shouts of "son of a--" and the "deja vu" shooting of the sheriff) were purely the result of the edited-for-tv print they worked with, and were absent from the original movie.one scene i wish had made it into the mst3k version: before entering the bar to question some people, joe don asks the maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside, because "they see that uniform, they won't cooperate." however, joe don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! i can't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him...one final observation on the original, uncut version of "final justice": why, oh why, did they feel the need to put venantino venantini's naked butt up on the screen?

i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language. (not 'dialect' as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as. as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other.) but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie. being a canadian, of cebuano parents, i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film. i was further excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies. but alas, i was short-changed.panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano. montano of course plays the hero of the movie. and when i say 'hero' i mean in the most stereotypical of manners; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol-anons to victory against the japanese. his character has no depth or complexity. he just fits the hero mold. the rest of the characters are one dimensional; they all fit their cookie cutter roles.i'm all for slow-moving/meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving. it didn't really meditate on anything. just because a movie is historically-themed, a drama and slow-moving doesn't make it a well-made film.particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony. his performance was embarrassing.if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through. he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc. but really, this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals. to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences, even if it meant sacrificing quality. obviously he didn't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience-attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door.i'm afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie. if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i'd get an answer like, "visayans don't make good movies. didn't you see panaghoy sa suba?" of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see.an example of movies that are meditative, not just slow moving, are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch's the straight story. i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non-tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie. these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called 'pure cinema'. images without words are used to convey the story. but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood.and what's with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother???

oh my god this was so bad! the story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. this film takes itself far too seriously...unless of course they meant to be funny. i saw this last week at the london sci-fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene. i think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at oopsalof'! and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalo's only line 'we will be together...it is our destiny.' i'm sorry but after the first time, the words lost all meaning.and what was with the apple?i recommend this as a lesson to americans: you cannot animate, so please don't try. you only embarrass yourselves.

this movie was a great disappointment for me. i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and i was a faithful follower of chaos comics until they went bankrupt. not only did they cut out half the story line, but they altered information. the statement that lucifer is hope's father is untrue. he did corrupt her father, but he himself is not her father. the voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie. it just did not do the comic justice at all!!

i also saw this amazingly bad piece of "anime" at the london sci-fi festival. if you have to watch this thing, do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers, you may then glean some enjoyment from it. i found the dialogue hilarious, lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator. the animation is awful. it is badly designed and badly executed. it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.there's nothing else to say really, this film is a failure on every level.

there's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, lady death: the motion picture just plain sucks. aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon. just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. there is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of she-ra, princess of power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.

and it falls squarely into the category of "awesomely bad" - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature, and i felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up, obviously to gauge the audience's reaction. what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" anime movie, i think it was "sky blue", the audience was in a sombre mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. i will bullet point the worst parts;script: the funniest, and worst part of this movie, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. rubbish, but eminently laughable.animation: poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (i know i can!), then watch out for the montage where she "trasforms" from a swedish peasant girl into lady death!!!characters: so one-dimensional its painful, there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.so, in a nutshell, if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain), then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a "mystery science theatre 3000" mindset. there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it, and its not meant to be a comedy. do not watch this movie alone. it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than "new world" with colin farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.

i am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything i could have imagined. the plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. the movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.with the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out.

well, i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it. the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course. the story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by four-year olds. does that cover it? i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life. i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation.to begin, the story moved too quickly. for someone new to this character and situations, i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution. i have seen other anime (if you could call this one an anime) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. there was nothing set aside for lady death. in a few short scenes, we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive she-beast of hell. this was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father. suddenly, she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years. this was absurd. the presentation of lady death was poor, to say the least. i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind. for me, it just didn't work. she was nothing more than eye-candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator. oh, i felt sick just watching her. the same goes for the character of cremator. who was this random person? the explanation they gave wasn't enough, and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development. it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature.next, there was lucifer himself. let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive. he was weak, his voice was laughable, and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind. it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semi-pc. he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies. he was not the ruler of hell, but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live. speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in hell? that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. most of the characters were worrying about dying, when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead. that is how they got to hell. i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me. i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but that could just be me  or maybe it was because there was no development in this story. there was nothing built, just preparing.the battle sequences were hysterically bad. the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s. there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn. why are we, america, so behind on animation? it is huge in asia, and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination. we are cheap, and this film shows it.overall, this film was bad. the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap. i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card. the production was horrendous as well as the story. nothing was developed, leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into. the strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained. i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come, you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.blah! grade: * out of *****

first of all, i'd like to tell you that i'm into comics, anime, animation and such stuff. it is true that everyone has his own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. i'll be objective. to begin with the story - it's ok. follows the story line of the comic books as far as i'm familiar with them. but the animation... well, it's not actually terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. it would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985. take a look at heavy metal fakk 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. so all in all - it lacks atmosphere. i watched it, but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it. it just does not capture you. there's plenty of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), but i don't think this is the audience for this movie. so they could add a little nudity and spice to it. the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have lady death herself! there are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. instead of bill brown's music i think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. all in all - the movie isn't that bad, but if you want something better take the original heavy metal, heavy metal fakk 2000, ralph bakshi's fire and ice or wizards maybe. and of course - vampire hunter d: bloodlust

the movie has one nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. it is quite a long scene. what was the point? i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.the movie is cold. none of the characters are even likeable. audrey tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl.i really would not recommend this movie. i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, educated french family and he looks down on these characters.

witty. quirky. genuine. surreal. butterfly wings? one could ask what all of these words best describe, and some (those in fuse with the international film community) may quickly say happenstance, but others may jump aboard the more american train and immediately yell, the butterfly effect. strangely, i would be one of those screaming for that sci-fi kutcher film mainly because none of those words that i initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the tautou feature that i witnessed. sure, we all loved her in amelie and thought she was the daughter of jesus in the da vinci code, but in this film first-time director (of a feature film at least) laurent firode doesn't give tautou the opportunity to shine. sadly, he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of "random chance" to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer (never a true boil). firode has ample, and i use "ample" as a small word, moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story, a genuinely whimsical fairy-tale of love and coincidence, but instead he fell face-first into a mud-bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.tautou's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box, but do not be so taken immediately as i did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into tautou's french cinema. tautou is in this film, do not get me wrong, but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story. firode's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly (albeit confusing) ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing "melodrama". he utterly, utterly fails. firode fails by giving us, the audience, too many characters. with too many characters he gives us too many random interventions, and by the end you don't really care who is who, or what is what, or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival. tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only firode would have given her the center. alas, he did not, but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny. it just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.firode fails because he focus' so intently on the minor details that, for one of those rare film occurrences, he actually forgets the central focus. i can say that there was no defined central focus to happenstance. in the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight, but we never go back to that throughout the film. instead, again, we are bombarded with new characters, stuffy scenes, and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of "ifs, ands, and buts". i couldn't do it. i couldn't believe this film. writer firode (yes, the same guy directing this garbage) uses a technique so primitive in this film that i immediately felt like ending it immediately. he must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline (or the scientific premise) because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks. i didn't need this, nor do i think firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter. while there were other elements that just didn't seem to work for me at all (again, felt like a jumbled parisian collage of shredded paper), this was the icing on the cake. i don't need my hand held through films.i will give this film one star for credit. this is a rather difficult genre to master successfully. time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for, but with happenstance it works because firode semi-explores the different avenues. while i will counter with saying that he does not do it well, it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment. i liked where firode was headed with this film, he had a genuinely diagramed story, but the final execution just blew this film to shreds. firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters, while lightening up his premise and story. i think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken. oh, how i only wish i could time travel back to the production of this film to show firode the errors of his ways.overall, for the first time (and probably last), this was a tautou film that i must say utterly disappointed me. from the choppy opening to the apathetic ending, i just felt that happenstance failed due to firode's leadership and horrid marketing. marketing is something that i didn't mention before, but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an amelie 2 (per the title released in hong kong), and why would you place tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all. i believe that from the first minute that passed on my dvd player, this film was in shambles. while i will applaud his subject, everything else was well below the level of mediocrity. i cannot suggest this film to anyone.grade: * out of *****

a missed train. a wrong phone number. an extra cup of coffee. what happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions."happenstance" tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal parisian folk. it has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.there's a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. audrey tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist (in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film) and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life.she learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her. what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters. does the prediction come true? the concept is good, but the storytelling is flimsy. the connections from one event to the next are weak. there's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the liberty mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of happenstance.if you enjoy audrey tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film, but you'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director.

i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that. the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) effect the lives of the others. the film's premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise. too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. as a result, i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. by the end of the movie, i had a "so what" attitude about all of them. a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but as it stands it is merely so-so

somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for "casablanca", didn't he? or didn't he. maybe there's more than one koch slinking around in hollywood, and i'm not too fond of "casablanca" anyway. wait a minute -- yes, there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood. that's the one who wrote "casablanca." no matter. i'll put as much care into this comment as "howard w. koch" put into this production, which is to say only a little.you know what this sounds like? somebody read cliff's notes on shakespeare's "king lear" and decided, since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express, to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending.there are differences. lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so, asks them how much they love him. two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money. the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear. but in the play, lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl. he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. kids can do that to you. (take my kid, for instance. after all the effort i squandered on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? no.) in the end, everybody in the play dies.in the movie, evidently, the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself, somebody jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy. that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy, unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself.

i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end, after you've already invested an hour into it. and that's what happened with this film. i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story. i haven't gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends.fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect).but milo o'shea as a jew?!!!! now that was funny. i haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film. before that point, a story and characters were developing,there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted. but ooh that last 1/2 hour- if that wasn't the screwiest, most worthless denouement i've ever witnessed, i don't know what is. i just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that; it feels like an act of violence.

i watched this on the tube last night. the actor's involved first caught my attention. the first scenes were attention getters. some funny some sad. good character development. i felt that the latter third of the film diverged. if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching. i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together.unfortunately i feel that it never happened. i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). was that the other shoe?would i recommend? no, i think not. as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. the ending totally turned me off.

i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story. this is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust.a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. if morris mishkin (zero mostel) will only believe in the angel (belafonte), his wife fanny (ida kaminska) will recover. the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel.when he believes it, fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly. it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris.jan kadar, who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's "the shop on main street" directs this film as well. kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces. she keeps calling for ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion. for most of the film, she does not realize the angel's appearance in her apartment.the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel's girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment, is memorable but all too brief.we don't know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died.those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation.

lol! not a bad way to start it. i thought this was original, but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong. i never saw king kong until i was 15. i saw this film when i was 9. the film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head! not to mention the film's theme song by the yetians. this is the worst creature effects i've ever seen. at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b-movies. memorable quotes: "take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power." i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira. there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse! in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl (who was falling)! also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man (1977) which came from hong kong. there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. this film will leave you laughing. it is like i said, just another king kong clone. rated pg for violence, language, thematic elements, and some scary scenes.

when i was a kid, i remember watching this while visiting a friend of our "uncle" phil. we're back! a dinosaur's story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called rex (voiced by the wonderful john goodman). he tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to earth to live. he explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. the doctor/professor villain of this film i think might have been responsible for them being them back, but i don't care about him. the kids might like this, but personally it is just too cheesy. john goodman was probably the only decent thing. poor!

children love dinosaurs. it's somewhat part of their culture. but they've got the land before time. the original. at least that movie had heart. this. this movie is just plain pathetic. just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children. this movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more by the numbers stuff. not as soul sucking as theodore rex, but it's lightyears away from being a land before time.

we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. basically, dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyes(which i needed after i watched this movie). apparently, neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation. the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter(too bad the screenwriters didn't have it). by the way, does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world, neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times? why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine? disease? war? i mean come on! doesn't neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has??? finally, when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing, dancing and wrecking havoc(basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip, i mean where else could you see a t-rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider-man?). they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes(???) makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. why? why would kids sign a blank contract??? screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some..."brain-drain" that he will let the children go. the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb, give in and agree to his terms. what?! this is stupid! they could have just menaced him, made him drop the contract, eaten it then walked off with the kids. i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him. oh yeah, that's not violent at all! we're back makes no sense, it's not fun, it's goofy, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film. even for a kid's film... this is bad.

this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series. a short lived japanese tv-show, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. this short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. a group of guys have captured a young woman. they tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her. they beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in "loving" closeup, push a needle through her eye. this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movies, and one of the first. it was probably this film, more than any of the others, that gave guinea pig the rumour of being snuff. they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas cage's movie "8 mm.". these movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles. they have progressed to more polished, but equally graphic movies like "naked blood". they probably fill the void left by the mondo movies, that got slightly cleaned up and became reality tv. not recommended, but will probably allure those who will see anything once, and wonder why afterwards, i know i did.

i've seen other guinea pig films, like mermaid in a manhole & he never dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them (however dark). devil's experiment though, is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever. it isn't remotely scary, except for perhaps the mind-set, but it's definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment. now, i'm not the paragon of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze, but this was too much for me, really. i'm all for disturbing, in fact, i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible, but this was a bit much. the young woman is kicked, beaten, submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools, and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere. if you think that sounds great, go for it, but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.

a found tape about 3? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways.yeah, spoiler.first of all, the acting made this short not scary at all, the woman seemed to have orgasms, not suffering. some of the punishments were so ridiculous! what's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair? if you are shooting a nonsense tape, at least make it good. the only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye, the rest of the film is really poor. to end the boredom, the supposed story about the tape being investigated, extra bullshit.

i just finished watching guinea pig - devils experiment. i have to say that this movie, although having very good fx, better then i expected, was not a good movie. i honestly cant say that i enjoyed this movie at all. of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but i found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). and also i found that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time, that ruined it even more (and im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). i have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - flowers of the flesh and blood. i wont say much more about devils experiment, other than great fx, descent acting from the girl, annoying fu**ing torturers, overall i give it 4 stars on account of the fx cos they are awesome.

this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. after having just viewed it, i can say it does not live up to those claims.the idea of the movie is indeed demented. but overall, the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy. even the final scene (the eyeball thing) isn't really that nasty. i was expecting something insane, instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent sh!t.any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed, since there is no story whatsoever (though surely most people know this). gore fans will be disappointed since, contrary to belief, the blood and guts here are few and far between. not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.regardless of what people say, this movie isn't that shocking, it just plain all out sucks. avoid it.

ah, the infamous "guinea pig" series...i honestly have to say that i've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ("he never dies","mermaid in a manhole", and "flower of flesh and blood" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but "devil's experiment" just plain blows. there is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "hilarious") tortures. "flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake "snuff" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, but "devil's experiment" just doesn't hold up. worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...

this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest, in my opinion. a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. and at this point, i will say that these films are not real! they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. for example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! and how stupid this looks! the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the ripping off of fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that. very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant. this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, flowers of flesh and blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible.guinea pig: devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is. this is still (of course) faked s(n/t)uff, the only difference to genuine "snuff film" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film. i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive. they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it. i watched this as a curiosity (as the other parts in the series) and now i know how insignificant trash these are. they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement. devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole (guinea pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen. so these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.

this movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is lindsay crouse's acting. i've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.her delivery is robotic. when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. so, her voice has very little inflection. i can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. she has to know somebody in the biz.now i hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be "this" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.however, i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it. the first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. but the end was disappointing as well. maybe if her acting had been better, i would have liked it.

here's a review for people like me. this movie sucks from beginning to end. i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000. the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? and she's rich???? and she's a famous psychologist????? come on, people. she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. rain man would have been insulted. i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. my hatred is so complete that it defies logic. but i'll give it a shot. that it's not supposed to sound real is fine. i don't care. it's that everyone talks the same. mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. no wonder his actors are so wooden. they're confused about everyone being the same character. (however, his later films do improve.)

by far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one over on us, as well as their dumb-witted marks, the cops, the mob and (ideally) each other. but this film never pulls this off. every scam can be seen coming a mile off (especially the biggen!) neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. perhaps mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships. if so, he failed. the lines are alright, but they're delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylised way that i thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time... but it wasn't. as for the psychological complexity, the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore, but she gets over it. i really liked the street scenes though. looked just like an edward hopper painting.

the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent. the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie. it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to one another. while the film has elements of early film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre.given that the presentation had no appeal to me, i was at least expecting an engaging story. usually i am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes. by the time of the, "gee, i forgot the $80,000," moment, i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous. for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief. if at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart.this wooden production left me cold.

david mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-man's movie, a movie that makes you question everybody and everything. i saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best-selling author. margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone. she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named mike (played by joe mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this film). she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her. intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book). she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.i don't feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of $80,000.first of all, the big twist towards the end was very predictable. any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads. not only that, but the audience (and the main character) knows that they're dealing with con men, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned? besides, margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people, yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind, she knows full well that mike is a con artist.secondly, we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning, yet in order for the con to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do. first, she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt, allowing her to meet the con men in the first place. if she hadn't done this, the entire con would have failed. i just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt. not only that, but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? did they simply show up at that bar every night, hoping she would come and see them? another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. what are the odds of this happening? and yet the whole con is based on this premise.another problem i had is with the ending. margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on mike. at first, mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con, but that falls through, so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area. somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade. not only that, but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her.ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. and if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying.

the plot of 'house of games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters, but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge. that's about the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets. it has to be the director mamet: lindsay crouse has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career, so she can't perform this badly all the time. she's supposed to go from uptight, cool, controlled professional to calculating, wicked fast lady having fun, as shown by the change from beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear) to floppy floral sundress. but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped, precise way; i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed. the effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. at times 'house of games' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot. the clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help either. the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic, two-dimensional performances. and they smoke too much!!!

i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions: jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. as a huge fan, i was sure he'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? yesterday, my bubble got burst big-time, boys and girls, because i saw the movie. the first act (where it's set up that he hates his life, he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god) is serviceable, the second act (where he's summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty) is great - carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny. but the third act is wretched beyond belief.the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace (jennifer aniston, who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her name reeks of unsubtlety) - she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead, he tells her (on bended knee, yet) that he's finally getting his news anchor job, and isn't it so exciting?she doesn't think so. she wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still loves him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next, until by the end i was praying, too. . .for it to be over. i didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, bruce prances into the room singing "what if god were one of us, just a slob like one of us", blah blah blah), and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us (for openers, morgan freeman - a/k/a god - tells bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this, a lot). those choices were forgivable - this is a jim carrey comedy, directed by tom shadyac - it aint the remains of the day. or rather it was supposed to be a comedy. when the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of (gag) message movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that grace is his saving - have to say it - grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued. all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way, however. the film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points. unfortunately, the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, light-handed way, so they went the bang-'em-over-the-heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice. they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste. it didn't work for me.

why did i go to see this film? honestly, because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star jennifer aniston's involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.however, as my "one line summary" suggests, i was disappointed. for various reasons;reason 1: it wasn't funny. in a 2hour movie, i laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time i sat thinking "i really should have got some ice-cream". i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes gem's such as 'the truman show' , 'liar liar' , 'me, myself and irene' , 'dumb and dumber' , 'the mask', and the 'ace ventura' films then produces, in bruce nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?reason 2: jennifer aniston's role was criminally underwritten. i mean hello! she's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. wrong.reason 3: one word - clichéreason 4: a casual deployment of specifically american references - jimmy hoffa, walter cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. "a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education - that's a miracle! want to see a miracle soon? be the miracle!" god tells bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. additionally, i still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.

jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. he has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala ace ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. or, in the case of 'liar liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. he was excellent in both 'man on the moon' and 'the truman show.' the guy is remarkable.then comes 'bruce almighty,' an ideal vehicle for carrey, and a premise that should have worked; carrey, after complaining about god and how his life stinks, is enabled with god's powers. however, the script is pure recycled garbage. now, no matter how bad a script is, carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. he seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it's really just annoying.i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on 'friends' and she was superb in last year's 'the good girl.' she too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. she comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'bruce almighty' should have been a comedy that works. but it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. a few minor giggles (his internet is yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. the movie fails on nearly every level. that's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it's close. any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. but hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it.

when i read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, i though that was clever and original concept. casting was promising too, carrey, freeman, aniston... how can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? it can. idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. bruce nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely deserves (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and oh horror!!!! dog who is not house trained!!! yes, as soon as bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a "god, why do you hate me!" manner, average viewer must think: "why, what's wrong with your life, bruce?". bruce is not, and definitely not the man with real problems in life. most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but god still addresses to him. why? though morgan freeman looks nice as a god, i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers? god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. no, wait, a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce. what does bruce do? pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! no more, bruce, please! what bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is "nice, family, little movie" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! nothing. just carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. aniston here is understated. she plays pale, undeveloped character of bruce's girlfriend grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. when grace says prayer for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. these two are not meant to be together. i would give three stars, but i doubt movie deserves a one. bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated freeman's and aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. but ok, there were few funny moments, and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.

i caught this movie on fx last night, and as i was sitting there watching it, it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever. bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally unbelievable fight sequences, stupid characters. all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i've ever seen. it was so bad, i was enthralled by it's sheer lack of anything semi-competent that i had to keep watching... and they made a sequel!

play mystery theater 3000 at home with your friends! rent this movie for the laughs! the acting is poor, the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable. i thought the movie was a joke until i looked it up on imbd. i can't wait to rent the sequel, china o'brien ii.

someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to high noon. now that is a real stretch! i'm a big sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been don knotts. first off, as someone pointed out, sinatra just doesn't have the build for a western bad-guy wannabe. he's just too 'slight' at this point in his life. maybe he was about the same height as say audie murphy, but murphy had a pretty solid build. sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously.the story is uninspired and really not credible. i don't want to spoil it but i think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story doesn't make any sense. another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy'. this is just a little town, so i don't get the attraction nor do i understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way.there is a 'love interest' in the story and if i followed it right, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy wouldn't kill him. now there's true love for you. 'stand up for yourself! tell him your name so he will kill you!' lol. stop, you're killing me.unfortunately the basic premise of the movie isn't good enough and no matter how they tried this story didn't have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket. want to know why it's not on video and never shown on tv? the critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. i would almost bet sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible.you want to see a good western where a town stands up against a bad guy? try tension at table rock, or at gunpoint - two really, really good westerns with that theme. johnny concho is johnny stinko. frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you didn't belong in a movie like this.

frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. he was a great actor, from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. i blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it? i think that this film should not have been withdrawn, because any film with sinatra is worth seeing, and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable

i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festival's prestigious competition section. i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.the film, some reviewers, have noted does not have too much of gunfire--but the inherent violence is repulsive. imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copolla's "godfather" that seem to resurface here in this chinese/hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.this film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here. at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values.

it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the source.here's a review without pretensions:just when you think nothing is going to happen, it doesn't.dress it up any way you like, this is a dull film, full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest.one to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're like, so deep, man.not something to watch for your own pleasure though.unless.you're.pretentious.

cut tries to be like most post-scream slashers tried to be, a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies. now, i am not bagging 'scream,' as i think 'scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy. cut fails on most levels. it has its moments but overall it just does not work out, not even as a "so bad it's good" movie, just a below average one.the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well, apart from the fact that kylie minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out, go figure. go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off, which is apparently cursed. and, as you have probably predicted, one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.unoriginal plot, poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow. there is plenty of referencing in the film, everything from 'scream' to 'the texas chain saw massacre.' this isn't smart either, it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream. for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it. really, i should be supporting this movie because i'm australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror (we do have our gems, though) but cut is definitely not one of them.however, it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so, so that is something good at least. i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away.2/5

this movie was pretty absurd. there was a few funny parts. its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think, "hmm.....that movie had a few funny parts, but overall, pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of)."i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy. and i didn't understand how he was a self made multi-millionaire and still such an idiot. anyways, i like ben affleck. he makes some crap, but hey, i can forgive him. i mean, i liked jersey girl, i didn't think gigli was all his fault, i like him overall. i guess he's kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can't seem to get it right.my advice would be to avoid this flick. it didn't really develop in to a workable plot and catherine o'hara and jimmy g. weren't used as well as they could have been. they deserved better. overall, this movie is not home alone, it's not a christmas story, its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics. forever forgettable.

i get the feeling that those involved in making "surviving christmas" didn't put much thought into the movie. the characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the one-liner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend christmas with them.ben affleck portrays drew latham, the typical hollywood image of a wealthy, egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life. his girlfriend, missy, leaves him shortly before christmas because she's disgusted that drew wanted to take her to fiji for christmas, which she calls "the family holiday," and the fact that drew has never introduced her to his family. we later find out that drew's father left when he was 4 years old, and his mother is dead, so it's a mystery why he doesn't just say that he has no family, rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn't care about his family.out of fear of being alone on christmas, drew tracks down missy's shrink (why? i have no idea), who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home. when he meets the family living in his childhood home, the valcos, drew offers them $250,000 to pretend to be his family, so he can relive his fond childhood memories. he gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter, alicia (christina applegate), because he "doesn't have a sister," and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his "real" family. none of this makes any sense once drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother.also inexplicable is the character of alicia, who is annoyed that her family accepted drew's money, and refuses to play along with his fantasy. but for no good reason, she suddenly starts to like drew, and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend. drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy; i almost wish he had finished with, "just kidding! the real reason i don't see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me!" (2/10)

there is one great moment in *surviving christmas* that almost makes it worth the pain: james gandolfini cracks a shovel over ben affleck's stupid head.this movie serves as yet another unfortunate example of james gandolfini proving what a great actor he is whilst simultaneously besmirching his career by acting in this film.young and wealthy ad exec, drew latham (ben affleck) has been inculcated into believing that one must never be alone on christmas. (and there, from the outset, is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie: how many people of drew's social standing, in 2004, truly care one way or another whether christmas is spent alone or with half the family or with a fifty-dollar prostitute?) storyline finds drew buying off a family to spend christmas with, on the condition that they pretend to be his own, insensately ignoring all the indications to the contrary that his money has not bought the emotions he was seeking.for $250,000, a surly suburban truck driver, tom valco (james gandolfini), and his disheveled wife, christine (catherine o'hara), agree to be drew's ad hoc family, against protests from their son, brian (a very one-dimensional josh zuckerman) and daughter, alicia (a very soft-focused christina applegate). drew then spends the rest of the movie supposedly recapturing his youth or - something. the messages in this movie are as twisted and illogical as its dry-mouthed storyline. fraught with overt psychoses, drew plasters a fake smile on his face and blindly remains in denial against every denigration that he was supposedly buying the valco family to avoid.which begs the question: if drew is paying these people to recapture some semblance of joyous familial emotion, how psychotic must he be to pretend happiness amongst their barbs and mental anguish over his presence? it is not a case of the valco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while around drew - three of the four members make it patently clear they despise him. is he so incognizant that he cannot see that his money is not buying him the "family" atmosphere he was inculcated into believing was a truth in the first place? as with all movies this opprobrious, one wonders how *four* screenwriters could possibly get so tangled in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a credits sequence that they will overlook any semblance of plausibility, or intelligence.director mike mitchell, who was responsible for *deuce bigalow: male gigolo* - stop right there. 'nuff said.gandolfini and o'hara somehow manage to shine, proving their mettle amongst this mess. christina applegate is willowy and cutesy and blond and fiery in all the right places, scathingly cutting drew into little strips of carcass for most of the movie, then doing an about-face and falling in love with him because the script tells her to.and i wouldn't go so far as to say that affleck is a bad actor, but john schneider better look over his shoulder. there's a whole new level of desperately seeking talent in town.

question: how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration ? answer: by turning it into an existential alienation parable.yes, we're back in the early 90s, just after the disintegration of the eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the european union, and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated upper-class politician, his existentially alienated rich wife, and so on.in the background, immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed greek village near the borders. i guess that way angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with the existentially troubled upper-classes. i mean honestly, the scene where some top-ranking army-officer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in london is enough to make you puke.anyway, it can't be that bad, angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all, right ? wrong. it's at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial, sort of like a filtered image in photoshop. his usual tricks show up: there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a weird wedding, a walk by the river-shore, and people with yellow water-coats. also mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever. avoid really. go for his early films.

this was my first, and probably the last angelopoulos movie. i was eager to get into it, as it featured mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo, of whom i've heard a lot. the opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian-greek border. ok! but that was all. nothing left. the movie had big holes and i don't know which to mention first. the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. it's like a 15 minutes monologue, killing the action and viewers patience, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart this old lady telling a story. all that is presumed to be shown through action, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. in a moment, the equippe of tv was heading to the bar. they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! probably, shot in different days, continuity leaked. a lot of problems with the story-telling, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. poor mastroianni, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. on the other hand, as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with, the movies showed lot of historic, ethnic, or politically incorrectness, just for the sake of making a movie about "humanity" as a red in another review. a lot more to say, but no time to lose on a poor movie, which was not movie at all, but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.

having enjoyed jean arthur in "the devil and miss jones", my interest was peaked, so i tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey--but i didn't make it to the end. arthur, photographed in a gauzy, movie-magazine fashion, either wants alimony from ex-husband william powell or another shot at marriage, but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness, but once inside a morgue--like all women in these '30's comedies--she faints). william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur, but you'd never know it from the end result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant over their banter. the actor playing powell's valet is excruciating, and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease.

apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called "movie." they described "blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence." i saw no "intrigue." i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. i saw no "violence." at least, i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with "impervious" skin--but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the "plot." furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. whatever you may choose to do, i will always remain correct, jonathan tanner  p.s. i was not blinded by the choreography.

i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. i buy them for fight scenes. a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes, but not the other way around.the story was decent, but moved too slowly for my tastes. there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout, lasting only a couple of minutes apiece. the last fight was a bit longer, but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it.

okay. who was it? who gave revolver 10 out of 10? are you tripping of your head on ecstasy pipes? there were so many of you. did you do it for a dare? is this some kind of cult? or did guy richie himself sign up 788 times under different names?before i say anything else, i'll say this. just because you don't understand a film doesn't mean that it's not great. maybe you've had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then weren't in the mood. maybe there's a more fundamental stumbling block- like you just don't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it. but. and this is a very, very big but. the xxl elephant-sized mega-but to end all buts.please don't confuse incoherence for complexity, and please don't confuse this two hour non-squirter for an interesting film. really. you may think you are pretty smart. you may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure: an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. please don't. you're embarrassing yourself. revolver's a waste of everyone's time. if you thought about if for a few minutes, you'd recognise it too. it was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of the caterers, and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you can't get them back you know) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable, wretched mess."no - wait," comes a voice in the darkness. "you just don't understand. its non-linear. that means the story doesn't go in a straight line. this is actually the complex and subtle work of an auteur. it addresses difficult existential questions. and anyway - they slated fight club when it first came out - didn't you hear? -because they couldn't deal with the complexity. they're eating humble pie now. bet you hate lynch films too, doncha?" hate to disappoint you, but i am quite a big lynch fan. i rather like memento, so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesn't necessarily fill me with fear. and although i've only studied it briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me greatly. i don't dislike revolver for these reasons. i dislike it because it purports to be about weighty, big-brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable. i'm not much of a chess player, but richie's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old. i dislike it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. "aha!" cries the richie apologist. "guy is cleverly tipping his hat to brecht!" just maybe you're right. i think its more likely that he just can't write a decent script for toffee.comparing revolver with fight club is actually really instructive. fight club has acid-tongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one-liners that make your ears bleed. fight club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened. revolver has, as far as i can tell, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because... well, they don't make sense. if you keep pulling the rug out from under people, they eventually kick you out of their house. and then they lock all the doors and windows. and they never let you back in. ever.guy richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz-phrases. mostly they are spoken, but often they flash up on the screen with attributions. it's almost pathological.but what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichés in the world. ultimately its so inconsequential. you don't care about anything. you don't understand anything. you go home.actually, there was a bit i really liked: the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence. he's great. but i can't recommend you see the film just to see him. he's only in it for a few minutes.please believe me. it's horrible.

i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before. after loving guy ritchie's two previous films (i don't count swept away - he was pussy blind), i was so looking forward to seeing this. the reviews were poor, then again, i don't trust the press anyway. more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation i handed over my £4.80 yesterday afternoon.i'm not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it! unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously.it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots, laughs, snappy dialogue and good characters. it's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones i noticed:the matrix, fight club, kill bill, the usual suspects, vanilla sky...i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors, jason statham and ray liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction that let the film down.so a big, big thumbs down from me.

was convincing the world that he didn't exist...this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. it's from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser gold..i mean sose..i got another one like that: -the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline-this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making i have seen in a long time. it starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. but alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction. and it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts.pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. and they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.and that's all jolly swell. but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. and apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like "fight club, kill bill, casino, the usual suspects, snatch, magnolia and shachnovelle. and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it's a blatant robbery.what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed. if this movie was a roller-coaster ride, you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off. there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it. nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going, you get pulled in yet another one.i guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next david lynch or something.1/10 for totally violating one's own work (ritchy: seek professional help). what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece, food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs. spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all cost!

after seeing "driven" on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created, and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again. unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case. revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it, just so i don't feel like i'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this. its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant, and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters, with totally inane pretentious nonsense! i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film, whilst all the time thinking - what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster/con man, whatever he's supposed to be, when he made his "offer"? i'll tell you what. he would have told him to f**k off, blown his head away, and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jake's head when they offer him their "solution" to his problem? they're con men, therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! i mean ffs. doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know he's been conned. anyway, i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films. bulls**t! this film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines, oh no. it somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny i genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the ugc in sheffield knows how full a main screen can get, and not 1 person so much as smiled. maybe he never wanted the film to be funny, and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy, but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask? the unnecessarily baffling plot!?? i sincerely hope not!by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end. it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over, and they were free from their torment!i'll round this off (i've got to finish, writing this is making me angry again) by elaborating on the "end". i mean sh**t! the ending.. no, sorry i can't, your just going to have to go and see it. it can't be put in words, it just can't, and after you've seen it you'll know why. uuhhhhh  shudders 

ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. here, he raids two recent classics  'the usual suspects' and 'fight club'  and still comes out empty-handed.despite parading itself as a con-mystery (with the sub-'usual suspects' twaddle "the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you" or whatever it was...) and attempting a 'fight-club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. by the last third, you know you're being lead down a blind alley, and tediously slowly at that.cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material.the only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is ritchie's bold way with with a scene and maurice-jones's dynamic camera. if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper.as it is, revolver is a waste of your time. incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. if you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'lost highway'.

guy richie's third proper film (not counting the god-awful "swept away" is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling, gangsters and chess. fans of richie's previous efforts will probably hate revolver as much as i did, with its twists and turns. richie stalwart jason statham plays jake, a newly-released ex-con, out to wreak revenge on the ridiculously named dorothy macha (a superbly ott ray liotta) but instead gets embroiled with a couple of other cons, (one of which is andre 3000 from rap outfit outkast) who throw him and us the audience, a number of red herrings throughout the film, all of which becomes extremely tedious. the high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot, slow-mo shootout set to beethoven's moonlight sonata. all in all, revolver is a flawed work, not truly awful but far from richie's best. that would still be lock, stock. if this film was a school homework assignment it would be graded 'must try harder!'

just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris. then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw) and kid (a very young scarlet johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack. the kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once.

the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. there are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. at times, this is truly an "edge-of-the-seat" film. but it disappoints, and disappoints severely.the villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. i refuse to "spoil" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.the second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "friday the 13th" films. not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.though the film features the magnificent sean connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.

just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof, kate capshaw (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer.weird casting, but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) first of all, i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. the coroner, witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black.connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. he is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial.connery is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good il' boys club but finds that the case against blair, the alleged killer, now on death row, was all fabricated. the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him.the beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him. connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting, hannibal lecter-like ed harris, he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon.he gets a re-trial and blair is freed.i think... film over....then suddenly! it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to enlist connery. he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris.now blair is on the loose again, thanks to connery's deluded pc principles! the final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama, connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades.that was one weird film.so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers, but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry.truly depressing on every level! the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too.two thumbs down. connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something.

a childless couple (brooke adams, jeff hayenga) go to a doctor (james karen) to try to conceive. it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby...pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script--the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end. i saw every "twist" coming. the direction is poor--he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene. the production values are--to be nice--lousy. very shabby. and, the gore scenes are too unpleasant (i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with lousy special effects. the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film.some good acting makes it somewhat bearable. adams, hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it. this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown--it's easy to see why. i give it a 4.

this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified. of course there probably wouldn't be an x-files if this show hadn't prepped this audience for it so well. darren mcgavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a plausible(enough) guy to deliver heroic deeds. check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents. here he is the main attraction, there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who's a distraction. in fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show. something i'm noticing as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way. there's a lot of throwaway humor to this show. sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax. there's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style. not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone.

no laughs whatsoever. yes, i watched this entire train wreck but only so that i wouldn't later wonder if cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (no, he had not.) this may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that british "humor" included black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago. what amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. if the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then i certainly pity your torturous existences. the humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. so who is this for? people who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other "low" humor. the three stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. they exerted some effort in making jokes work. this however is sloughed off schlock. i fear that it is the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. next you'll be telling me that tabloid tv is popular. :(

i was expecting a very funny movie. instead, i got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn't work. i didn't like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes' and moriarty's descendants. it was confusing. it would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of moriarty resurrected. some of the things were funny. burt kwouk was very funny, as always. mccloud on the horse was funny. the mcgarrett from hawaii 5-0 was not even mcgarrett-like. connie booth obviously is very good with accents. she is from indiana, but played english and a new yorker pretty well. unfortunately, she was not presented much into the script. i was expecting a more funny film. instead, i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script. rather ironic, since both booth and cleese were together on this one. maybe they were about to break up in 77.

i viewed this movie in dvd format. my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd. i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani. while fun to watch, i feel she didn't live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films. i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance. the other two actors i wasn't very familiar with so i can't compare their performance, however they were fairly enjoyable also. the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. the story line, while some could say slightly compelling, lacked direction. i feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.

this movie is a re-write of the 1978 warren beatty movie, "heaven can wait", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of mr rock. the premise remains the same: lance barton, (rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god's representative, mr king, to come back to earth as someone else. as in beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered charles wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies sontee jenkins (regina king) who happens to turn up at wellington's house during the murder. the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work. also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real 'white' wellington, fail miserably. improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - but they certainly were not to be found in "down to earth".

jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease. were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film, this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism.stefan (tom wlaschiha) journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused. he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory, but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation. simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place, each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini's opera 'turandot' which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera. a police investigator louise tolliver (irit levi) and her companion cop (kalene parker) follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory. he encounters a strange lad jeffrey (jim thalman) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs (richard conti) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects. how this all come to an end is the play of the film, a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders.while tom wlaschiha, jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles (they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film!), the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker: when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero. there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit, but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of 'nessun dorma' as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film! good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors, but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing. grady harp, february 06

one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film ascript existed that made any sense. was the rough cut 3 hourslong and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? why would anyone finance this mess? i will say that tomwlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canwith the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. butcharacters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity isnon-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (toput it politely) amateurish. not one sleeps is an unfortunatechoice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyoneactually attempt to actually watch this film.

i can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton, and sure it's his company. but "you're fired" or "you're hired", for how many seasons now? after watching the show i wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.i'd love to hear just one person get up and say "donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo". i see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe. i hope he gets hurt so i don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. i'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that.

i bet you gene simmons and vincent pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. isn't just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? and big pussy? what the hell was that "look at me, i'm a rat!" double episode crap? all that cliché mafia banter- come on! the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. hmm... this is not reality but staged drama! mark burnett's other show, "survivor" also raised questions for me when johnny fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.yuk!

i loved the apprentice for the first two seasons.but now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things are getting just plain too tiring.i used to like the show, but its become donald trumps own ego fest. granted its his company you'll be working for, but come on! some of the things says "you're fired" is just insulting.after watching the show, i would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or such. its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm. good entertainment? yes, but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring.. its not team work, its not personal, its just business. watch your back jack.

for the first couple of seasons, i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show. the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job-interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there".the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (that means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.). the boardroom can be entertaining to watch, but it's entertainment at it's low-point - sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode. the tasks on the show are, at most, boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity. and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life. i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem like idiots to me. in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. it also seems like donald trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest, i can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth.r.i.p the apprentice. please nbc, for god's sake, get the show off the air as soon as possible. it's just too embarrassing to watch. the apprentice was once a great tv-show, but now it's just a big fat joke.

besides being boring, the scenes were oppressive and dark. the movie tried to portray some kind of moral, but fell flat with its message. what were the redeeming qualities?? on top of that, i don't think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did.

for anyone craving a remake of 1989's slaves of new york. what are there, seven of you? here it is... was.this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (well they're club-kids, ya big jerk!) that are in holding patterns. the big question seems to be, just how long can a young adult remain juvenile? it took three people to write this 'story'? good god, it was easier to come up with citizen kane. rather than take viewers back, this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s.the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-somethings could imagine it. the odd sidebar about library work is not the sub-plot one expects from the equivalent of parker posey's breakin 2: electric bugaloo. her "i'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical. posey's shtick is always amusing, but there are projects that are beneath her. i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark.

i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. so after watching the trailer for "water lilies," i expected to like this film because i thought i'd stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of "beautiful thing." the main characters are young french women 15 years old. marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it. "water lilies," however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless, mechanical sex. it also proves that screenwriters and film-makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.in the extra features on the "lord of the flies" dvd, director peter brook says, "french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex," meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. part of the downfall of this film is film-maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism."where is the joy?" i asked myself while watching this film. yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-affirming way. these positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no balance.organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. first, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema, as evidenced by films like "the slingshot; the rascals; the devil, probably; the little thief; murmur of the heart; friends; beau pere" and "europa, europa"; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - "see, audience, i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude." either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go.there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing. what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie; it is film-maker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she's about to request something that is "not normal." marie understandably asks, "who cares about being normal?" then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because floriane's request is a phony, derivative and substitute question - not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve. here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves: 1) since when do the french - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2) what teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?the three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors. louise blachere (anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. adele haenel (floriane) could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. pauline acquart (marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. in the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.all in all, "water lilies" was very disappointing. will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! no - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. and yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.

when i ordered this from blockbuster's website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was. who knows? maybe i'd forgotten to take my add meds that day. i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon, donned in their late 70's-style wide collars, bell-bottoms and feathered hair, i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe, forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer. from the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the "monsters" from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'the vagina monologues'.throughout the film, the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear. the "ship" was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path. of course if moved slower than bob barker's impacted bowels, but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two (with some assistance).moving on... as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue... we found out that they're caught in a "space time warp". how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information? because the oldest male lead tells his son that, in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion, like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola. was pops a scientist? nope, but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein's theories.the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality. the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, other than that, it was really, really, really bad. (there's not enough 'really's' to describe it, really).i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. i never saw this film on its original release, but even back then i think i would've come to the same conclusion: bury this one quick.

this, is not one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe i have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason i bought this was i wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one i could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is really tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed i would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, do not buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! utter utter utter uttter unbelievable garbage! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow that.

i saw this when it was in the theater, it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time. now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations, and other related psychological factors. now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining. it builds to an excellent climax then.... it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it, besides being a very poetic description. in my experience, it was just not strong enough. my wife and i were well... how can i say this? we were upset, i mean we paid money, invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent. "we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly. in fact my wife said it best, it did not end, it just stopped!

hi, may be because i am not a theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher ... i think this movie is "boring" and "dumb".i rented this movie because of charles bronson and it's title ... but boy what a waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ...the movie on this dvd was so "dark" ... i had hard time watching the darn movie ... i realize it is a 1968 movie ... but they are putting it on a dvd then they should do some digital remastering.also, i was totally surprised to see these high marks on imdb for this movie ... like i said before i am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier.

what a dog of a movie. noni hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast. many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated colin friels.very little works in this pretentious garbage. much of the "character development" is done through a silly, angst-ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on-screen. in fact, it's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen! how are we meant to know colin friels (javo) is meant to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? one of these silly voice overs tells us. for crying out loud, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin' voice over! the real killer is the characters. everything about them. their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers. they are all absurdly well-spoken for "junkies". none seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.monkey grip deserves no more attention than a weekday tv movie matinée. crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere. at least noni gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity. there's no other sane reason to endure this junk.

okay, now what the hell is this supposed to be? is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg's "close encounters of the third kind"? or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as "when dinosaurs ruled the earth" and "the lost world"? perhaps it's an intellectual & philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend? yes, that must be it! whatever it is, the creators of "the day time ended" (good old john 'bud' cardos of "kingdom of the spiders" and writer david schmoeller of "tourist trap") must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres. the story doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but, hey, who cares as long as it's got papier-mâché dinosaurs, miniature spacecrafts, headache-inducing light & laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas! the voice-over introduction is practically inaudible, but no worries as it's all gibberish! did you know that the definition of 'time' isn't what we all think it is? time doesn't necessarily pass by chronologically, it is one giant paradox! words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us. i have absolutely no idea what all this means, but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap-dancing midget aliens and well-mannered dinosaurs on screen together. i deliberately say well-mannered dinosaurs, because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets. the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar-powered house in the middle of nowhere. grandpa is extremely annoying, the granddaughter even more, granny is a walking & talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery, the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is  incredibly hot! chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy's husband on business travel. the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable (i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about "excellent special effects" was being sarcastic), but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs! just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing: grandpa: "you know what this is, don't you? this is a time-space warp!stevie: "i'm not quite sure if i know what that means, dad"grandpa: "well, i guess nobody really does" make up your mind, gramps! do you know what it is or don't you? and stop talking about "the vortex" like you're some kind of expert in the field! "the day time ended" is an incredibly childish and not-worth-bothering-for fantasy movie, though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects. the ending completely comes out of nowhere, like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly.

c'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. it's just an old 60's tv show ! this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe (yeoman barrow's) ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.this use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.except a few notable exceptions i.e "the city on the edge of forever" , "assignment earth" and "tomorrow is yesterday" the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery. half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a lot of rubbish! he doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example.just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view. they used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. you can clearly see the folds in the paper ! every expense spared or what !

this picture started out with good intentions, bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and shue is cute as usual in her role. it all falls apart after that, it's your typical hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul. in other words, don't waste your time watching this. get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead, also starring leonard nimoy. now that was good, and hg wells is well served, unlike with this mess.

i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie. it's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. the problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle, overlooking the capitol building in washington, d.c. that kind of life on a government salary? hah! it only gets worse. toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool. the special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films, but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven's previous, facially stupid movies (showgirls, starship troopers), but this movie should stop the wondering. he's just plain bad.

that's what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film. first off, the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back. the rest of the movie, though...none of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable 3rd act (i promise i won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. please, give the viewers more credit than that!!!some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. what would you do, after all, if you were invisible? no one could catch you! these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933. there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. if more attention had been paid it, kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense. the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno, since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner. but this piece of work... go see something else. or don't, and live with the consequences!3/10

when i first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. bill compton introduced himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and sookie presented herself as an independent woman. however, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box.as the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities. by episode 5, bill's furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead. sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. all these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity. personally, i think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show. the way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more. as soon as sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz, only thinking of bill's libido and the size of his appendage. bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just gets plain silly. his actions are never really explained except he does it for sookie. why? their love for each other is never delved into, if there is any love. so far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship.yeah, yeah, vampires usually equal sex but come on. every five seconds i see some sort of humping going on. it wasn't that much of a surprise, since hbo always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent tv show. bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with sookie with no reason what's so ever? i laughed so hard i almost peed myself.the plot is just a stream of consciousness. the characters never go into detail about anything. all the events that happen are usually left unexplained. the only thing that is constant is the sex.the only thing i can say that i do like are the minor characters. tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters. the only reason why i continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters. minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile.

for every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. from such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.and so it goes with true blood; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen play, a pilot, and finally a series. unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings. oh how wrong they so often are...true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines, worst acting, and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history. its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents. alan ball's not so secret desires for ryan (jason stackhouse) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline. tara's angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the confedercy. sam finds suppressed love for sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning, noon, and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship.as for bill the vampire, his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her (although she remains somewhat unharmed). we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy meals with legs.despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes, i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show, its still bad. somethings die for a reason, even vampires. maybe this show should to.

this show had a lot of hype but i didn't know about it until the midseason (season 1). someone even recommended the show to me. but i decided that if i was going to watch it, i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk. due to the show's format, i'm happy i waited. i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story.somehow, this show has managed to throw in too much sex. jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves. right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed, he's in bed with another woman the next night! then tara and sam get it on, despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie. and for some reason, sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it--even though she's sleeping with a vampire. one of the problems with the show, is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters. i really didn't care for jason at all. along with his endless pursuit of tale, he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him. after a few episodes, i wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow. for that reason, i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookie's grandmother became a victim (since the first two were more closely involved with jason).then once sookie and bill have sex, the story gets a few more subplots. tara's mother wants an exorcism, then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon. i wasn't so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff. however, they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about $1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother. at other points, some of the developments happen too fast. jason continues being a jerk, trying to sell his grandmother's stuff to buy vampire blood, which apparently is the new crack or something. in his search he finds this girl who will do v (vampire blood) with him. they get high, and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v. another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal. he's only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks "vampire politics" are more important than her.subtlety is not this show's strong suit. it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog. although my assumption wasn't dead on, it wasn't that much of a surprise. but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself. when tara gets into the car accident, the naked lady's face with the pig is clearly shown, and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout. as if that wasn't enough, they later show the lady again with the pig at her house. then it's time to wrap up the murder story. at the end of the penultimate episode, it's revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer. in the final episode, they shove renee being the killer in your face. sookie remarks that it's odd that renee's thoughts don't have an accent. i thought that was fine, as it adds to renee being a fraud. but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee. they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of renee's boxes about how to fake a cajun accent. at this point it was just ridiculous. i mean we get it!!! so blah blah blah stuff happens. bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie, who still manages to kill renee. they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues. the naked pig lady and sam have a history, lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed. jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti-vampire church--which makes me care about him even less.it's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show. i think i just expected this show to be better. i'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2, but if i watch it, i'll most likely wait for the season completion.

after watching some of hbo's great stuff - band of brothers, rome, etc. - i must say i had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of "true blood". jeez. often the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old, some parts are just horribly filmed, (the scene in which she "saves" bill, i mean come on. she throws a chain at the guy and ow! it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him! that was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion. or a few moments before that scene, when she finds out that the couple is gone with bill, ridiculous. she hears them plan their stuff, and like 5 seconds later, magic! the 3 of them are gone, and without any struggle or noise or anything!i mean the idea of the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires co-existing with human in our modern society... but honestly i don't think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show, that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about... unfortunately, the script is written poorly, mediocre at best. it's shallow and extremely predictable. often i thought that this was some kind of a joke or something. the actors deliver really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. they seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were some kind of a regular, low budget family tv show (well maybe thats what it is, if you take away the family part). the only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was stephen moyer in the role of bill, considering the poorly written, extremely short replies he had to say "what are you..." "can i give you a call sometime...", i think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have, actually. anna paquin was okay as well, but not more. but the guy, playing her brother though, jeez, he's horrible. the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television. the acting is bad, the construction site looks fake to the bone, and the two other guys "why is he getting arrested? uh.. i dunno..." that was pretty embarrassing. another thing that i think was completely missed was the way they presented sookie's psychic powers. they make us hear what people think and speak both at the same time and thats just wrong. often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel, and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think. and finally, the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting. don't get me wrong - i wrote all these comments not because i thought the show was bad, but because i was very disappointed. i expected quality stuff. i didn't think it was going to be like that. it's definitely not a good show though. mediocre at best.

one of those classics, held up next to "deep throat" and "behind the green door."sure, it was clever, but the female lead isn't that attractive and sex isn't that hot. but if not for this film, porn would not have blossomed into what it is today.harry reems was the ron jeremy of his day. worth a look if you're a fan.

a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like "debbie does dallas". nowhere close. i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever. even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. but i read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value. i was unable to find it though. see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies. i know i am not. but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person. he even tried to get simon & garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs. of course, they rejected.

there is a dvd published in the uk in 2002 code hrgd002 on the cover, no asin, vfc 19796 on the disk, no ifpi code in the inner rim.probably a straight transfer from vhs. there is no much point is commenting an adult film. but this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas.i've seen it in pensylvannia way back in 1975.as such it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies. the dvd has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a vhs tape as source

yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. still, i did not like this one at all. about a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. crappy sex scenes to follow. why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. i mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. little girls blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. of course the girls in that one are very cute. here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. if you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. the sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre...i mean there is a snake in one of them people. so for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off.

to describe this film as garbage is unfair. at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining.kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance, so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay. the mad scientist story of 'hollow man' has been told before, been told better, and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects.most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies. in the uk they were marketed as 'the transparent man (/woman/dog)' which is maybe where they got the title for this film.clever special effects, dire script, non-existent plot.

another violent, angry fantasy from paul verhoeven. verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`the river wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.

there are two kinds of characters on the shield: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope. more than any other show, the shield is about hypocrisy and self-delusion. unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes, and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again, making fools out of all of their peers.the show boasts excellent camera-work. the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. it really is a work of art to see. unfortunately the story is a cartoony, overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape, and lies.the hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications. if another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause. every time.like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season. boring, unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody, perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups.most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims. sometimes, they want us to see shane as the enemy. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel. then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends, that's it. it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. but then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.

shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role. elizabeth shue is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? i must give credit where credit is due, though. some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon's character, sebastian caine. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, that has any form of self-respect to account for.

i consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama, i can be very stuck up about films, too.not all art films, however, are better than king kong. i quite possibly would give kong two stars, double this film's haul.my guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play. for the less discerning art-buff, a film that looks like a play is 'great art'.this film, however, was useless.there was hardly any story so it relied on high drama. the only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not. so, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? no. great acting? hardly.to be excessively fair: some of the scenery was interesting, though: communist flats, city vistas (petersburg?) and the soviet trams still in service.

like wearing a hair shirt. positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever. pure torture. zero stars out of ten. one long, tedious, labored, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical, and leadenly artsy scene after another. intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic, the soul bared, it is, instead, morose mush. half-naked, father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers. "homo-erotic" is the point, loud and clear. ok, so what? repeated more than once by the son is the line, supposedly lifted from "lives of the saints," "a father's love crucifies. a loving son lets himself be crucified." the parallel to god and his son, christ, is heavy-handed, irrelevant, and bombastic, like everything else here. some reference points to the theme of russian filiality: "mother and son" (1997); "the return" (andrei zvyagvatsev, 2003); "little odessa" (james gray,1994); turgenev, "fathers and sons"; and, of course, dostoyevsky, "the brothers karamazov."credits in english indicate intended international distribution, meaning that the excuse cannot be used that you have to be russian to understand this mess. this is nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as sokurov's last, "russian ark" (2003).as in his "mother and son," an equally powerful soporific, some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors, though not as interestingly. the film is almost monochromatic, shot from start to finish through beige filters, making it as visually as it is dramatically numbing. a soft-focus haze only adds to the drugged feeling.an annoying soundtrack drones on, never shuts up, like a tape loop. an old radio constantly plays in the background. russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "themes based on tchaikovsky." the presence of a "sound designer" (sergei moshkov) signifies, of course, that all those irritating little sounds, radio static, noises, distortion, and such, are "designed." it's hard to believe someone (sergei potepolov) actually wrote this thing. it all seems as arbitrary as traffic, as if improvised by bored actors, popping out of nothingness into nothingness.modern art has finally succeeded in signifying the thing without being the thing, so that what we behold is the idea of the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, merely the idea of a shell. could one ask for a better definition of decadence?

this film is beautiful to look at, but is like watching really bad experimental theater. the plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense. but it is very "artistic". lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes. lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame. mumbling and people wandering wistfully. lingering close-ups of faces and bodies. by the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of ky at the screen.it is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship, but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f*$& each other and get it over with. if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish has been granted.

the film begins with promise, but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. we are left hanging, but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour. certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over. it's a shame, because the concept is not without merit.we are left wondering why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining. this loss of presence in the real world is, rather too obviously and unnecessarily, contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces. why not the circus, so we can at least appreciate some colour? we are left with a gnawing sense of loss, but sadly no enlightenment, which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all.

from a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. basically, five characters appear in the movie, a son & father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. the movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. there were a couple of brilliant scenes. at the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. the photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was "older". end of that story.

set in south africa, a young black guy tries to land a part in a 'gangsta' movie. but with no knowledge of street life, he's told to find out what that life is really like or he won't get the part. he manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted. but for the gang's leader, the burgeoning disaster of his new friend's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own.while that may sound relatively interesting, it's anything but. the first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious, while the "hijacking" only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases. in those "chases", only two police cars are used, both of which are early 90's nissan sunny's. not only would these be rather cheap to pick up (and i find it rather hard to believe they'd be using such mundane old cars in south africa in the year 2000), but as far as i can remember, there's only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once. the car chases are very badly shot, with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads, and they're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting. this now leads me onto the characters and the acting, which are equally bad. the aforementioned kid who drives the car, looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police. everybody else is equally unconvincing, so much that they even look bored at times themselves.at the closing scene of the movie, our main character ("sox moraka") is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park. while having trouble opening it, the police arrive and ask him what he's doing and he replies by telling him it's their car. after a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car. after he's in, the police return fire and in turn he gets wounded. after another pathetic chase sequence, they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence. what follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects i've ever seen. when the car "explodes", superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that aren't even in time. it's so badly done and so phony looking that it's hard to even put it into words, and really needs to be seen to be believed. if you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier. i've seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries. the car is a volkswagen golf mk2 gti. something that wouldn't be worth a huge amount at all, and they seriously couldn't afford to destroy it with a real explosion? i'd love to know how large the budget for this movie was. it feels so cheap that i'm surprised it made it outside of south africa, and even more surprised it made it to a dvd release.i know it's not a big budget hollywood production. i know it's meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of south africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market, but with the laughable effects, poorly executed car chases, awful acting and ludicrous characters, any sense of reality is completely lost.overall, i most certainly do not advise you to watch this. if you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done, low budget messes of amovie ever created, then i'd recommend it for that, and only that.it is a wretched, poorly made, poorly edited, poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts. i've seen many south african movies, including lots of cheap nuimage/nu-world action pictures, and despite their cheesiness, they're far better than this on all counts.

this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. there are some interesting visuals.aside from that, it's typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. true to the title.it's not worth picking apart the story. that's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. there's not much there to begin with. it's nothing original and not very special. so don't go in for the story at all. just look at the effects.as has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. however if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it's a sight to behold (or not to behold).all in all, it's a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone.

the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear. sadly, they stopped there. they should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. because, there's nothing else there to show.gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. i don't really think they exist. i think they bought this script at "scripts-r-us", where you buy a standard blank "monster movie" script and just fill in the blanks. there's a monster stalking us. let's split up. (they actually "let's split up" in this movie). hit alien/giant-bug/monster/invisible-man with crowbar. not dead yet. burn huge-rabbit/shark/invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. not dead yet. you know, the standard stuff. even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (ir glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. they psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. all in all, it stunk.i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but i don't want to do any spoilers. suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than...

i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. the special effects of this movie are very good. i have seen most of this movie, since it's been airing on hbo for the past couple of months. i must admit, i may have missed a few scenes, but i'm usually drawn into movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. but every time i see some of "hollow man," i feel depressed, almost like a "film noir." i'm not sure why; perhaps it's that i don't want kevin bacon to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. but i think it's witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes. regardless, i can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are mature).

other than some neat special effects, this movie has nothing to offer. they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting, but with no success. kevin bacon's acting was pretty good, but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot.

paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one. he became a joke on himself. once again we have a film which includes sex and violence, immorality, leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans.its all for nothing. because their is no action at all in this film. it fudges all its set pieces. all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film. in other words rampant over acting on almost every level. starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited. in this scientists are acting the same way. sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset.one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens (elizabeth shue excepted) walk and talk. why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all??? think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of story and characterisation. then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was.more insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius. well one out of two isnt that bad.this film has nothing of note in it. just like the title says.hollow!!!

unfortunately, one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering, silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate, clichéd screenplay. hollow man is a rather useless film.practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects. however, it is just the same special effect done over and over again, and by the end of the film that has been done to death also. i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. this is not so. it isn't long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clichés piles up so fast that it's almost impressive.on top of all this, kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best. good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score (but no competition for his better efforts), a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects. i was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push hollow man's merit up one notch.4/10

i don't normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i don't like, but in a case like this one, i just have to say something. this movie is terrible, illogical, and stupid. there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience. the most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon's character's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition.granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff (the director's cut of robocop on dvd is great). however, this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter, and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment. in short, as many other reviews here say (wish i had read them before...) - stay away from this film!

motocrossed was fun, but it wasn't that great. i guess i just didn't understand a lot of the motocross racing "lingo" (and there was a lot of that in the film)! the plot wasn't what i expected from the disney channel previews, so that could account for some of my disappointment.

although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front, this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary. this depicts the funnest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times.when we finally see some battle, it is lame: an enemy plane flies over? shoot it down (in one shot). sniper in the tree? kill him before he gets a shot off. enemy soldiers in the woods? not to worry, they gladly surrender. ho-hum.tepid, turgid, predictable...

'nobody knows anybody' is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist/nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week. he also happens to be the best friend of the film's hero. the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game, with himself and the hero as players, and seville as the virtual environment. the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman-type games. looked at this way, the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black-hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays. from the start, we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game - the hero's job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper; at one point, the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend's father. clues are liberally scattered, as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant (e.g. the advert in the bar). the detective/paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress, rather than an investigation after the fact. the film borrows heavily on 'se7en''s pattern narrative, and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter.in this reading, the game is on the level of narrative, with the hero fighting against an enemy (in this case, the computer) to win and save the day. but there is a second game, the film itself, which subvert the first. there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer's intentions, but the filmmaker's and his hero's. in the first ten minutes there are references to chess, a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin. if we remember that the chess-loving nabokov's 1930s pseudonym was sirin, we see another game afoot, one where we suspect not the villain, but the hero himself. in a nabokov novel like 'pale fire', an author-figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives, provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text. throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted (e.g. the image contracting), or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero's point of view. the opening references to games are all linked to him. in the early sequences, much is made of the character's sexual and creative impotence, so the film could be his attempt to master his life, to be a winner, in a way he can't for real. no sooner has he won the game than his writer's block vanishes; the words he types are the title of the film, suggesting he is the overall author. further, that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively, a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero, like kinbote, trapped in his own solecism.this jumble of post-modern literature (borges, eco, pynchon et al are alluded to also), fincher, 'x-files', 'run lola run', chris marker (the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text; and as a cultural history haunting the present), bunuellian anti-clericism, and alex de la iglesia's 'shock' films result in a film that is just that, a jumble, each clever-clever allusive element cancelling out the last, dissipating interest. the lack of clarity about the game's rules renders it incomprehensible, and eventually wearing. ironically, in a work of such overdetermined artifice, the film's main interest lies in its documentary quality, as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently. such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like 'sans soleil' or 'london', but, ultimately, you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness.

holy crap! what a terrible, terrible spanish thriller! i've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night. i watched an hour or so before heading to bed. i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing. i finished it last night and couldn't believe where i stopped it the night before. literally, i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill.like i said, i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar. i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a "menacing" game of laser tag. whew! then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds. whew! you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil (co-writer of amenabar's two big previous hits). there is an excellent score and great photography. but this scenario reeks of silliness. how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.

absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by amenabar's usual collaborator mateo gil. the film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers none, and seems like an exercise in boredom. the only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100-plus minutes, and is resolved too simply. the plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). the hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. if you're fans of the genre, watch "tesis" instead.

it's not the most well made slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty amusing. the plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. i have to be honest, if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film, you wont find this film as funny as those who do. i knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour, in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. it's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills,most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch, drink and be merry!

i just finished watching this movie. i was very excited since i'm a big fan of punk rock, horror films and spoofs. i was very surprised at what i saw. i knew it was low budget, but i wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera. it opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, the horrorpops, reforming their song, where they wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. it's a great opening. but the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. a live performance, a death. another live performance, a death. it gets old. and there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. why doesn't the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. like the hardcore french band, known simply as beret, the prospect of a band named atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and bowling for soup's overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that i will save for the future watchers of this movie. but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the "actors". especially warped tour creator, kevin lyman. he tries very hard, but i suspect that he didn't want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something. in addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd. the movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil. bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror, music, or comedy film. although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to, otherwise. such as tsunami bomb, and the phenomonauts(an insane, psychobilly band). i recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on. if not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances. they rock! long live punk rock and horror!

well, if you like pop/punk, punk, ska, and a tad bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching. this movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with president of troma, lloyd kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of goofy death scenes. sounds like it may be good, right? well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event. some of the deaths start of stylish, but then they are recycled over and over, to the point of being completely repetitive. almost everyone dies of having their head smashed, or intestines being pulled from their stomach. the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas' "zombie 90: extreme pestilence"; with this being the "watered-down type blood", but now that movie is actually decent, and provides humor-something that this movie terribly lacks. sure, the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma, it's got great low-budget potential, and it tries...but just too hard. everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie, and thats what brings it down. everything tries to be too comic and goofy, by using intentional bad acting, an overuse of pointless deaths, and doing the same thing...over and over. it's basically "mulva: zombie ass-kicker", "chairman of the board", or any movie you have made with your friends: it's funny to those who made it, and that's about it.great potential, great idea, great use of effects-but it's the same thing...over and over: a band plays, a band dies, fans die. everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated.the question is for these types of movies-which is basically 'bad slap-stick'-do they try too hard, or not at all?

judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic, many places ridiculousone wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife? when he earns so much just to show how poor he is?the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny- paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny, paresh irritates farida is decent

men, do i love police movies filled with action, shooting, chases etcetera.boy, was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. we've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding... yet, 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some kevlar.not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. going back into the bank, where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out. how stupid did the director think we'd be.okay, the shots in between that fake a documentary were good, but after seeing the film i only got the thought: why didn't the police get a decent shooting course? and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break. truly bad.

the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot. so the basic idea is, the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one, but they're powerless because the villains' guns are just a bit bigger. i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of. they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously, what is wrong with these guys? they're talking like they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. okay i admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire, even when the situation is so much to your advantage, but don't go nuts. and why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? i'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot. they're like ten ft. away, they hit absolutely nothing. then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. and then yeah, there you have it, one of the cops actually hits someone. bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something. i had a good laugh i guess.

contrary to my principles, let me first come up with a conclusion, because i have just seen this piece of "art", and still am under strong impressions. the reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary.well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and i would never bother to write a single word about it, if it were not for the fact that "44 minutes" made me sick to death, which rarely happens to me. the fact that i paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better, as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here.so what is wrong with the movie? it has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". one first thinks about "15 minutes", which is by the way a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and indeed the two can be compared to some extent. but, as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst characteristics. they both feature mr. oleg taktarov, who with his strong russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices. his purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind. ah, do we miss the good old times. now, i don't imply that he is a bad actor, i am yet to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype. how anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension. we can recognize modern american xenophobia here. the point in the movie when taktarov explains to his companion that romanians are not germans, and that they are in america is truly laughable. are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become "true" americans? then, there is the media issue. yes, it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. the director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes. instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show, trying to reinvent the wheel. in 15 minutes the issue of media is the central one.the point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are focusing on 44 minutes now. so, i have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie. what is it? to provide good time for the audience? to glorify weapons? to glorify police? portray violence? oh yes, the officer gives the bible to the underage delinquent. so it must promote peace and understanding after all? i don't think so, but don't ask me. i only know i didn't enjoy any of this.ah, michael madsen. i admit, i am a big fan. i hoped he would be a bright point, but i was wrong. it's not his fault though. as the final note, comparing "firepower" to "willpower" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines i have ever heard.to summarize, on the scale 1-10, i give it a pure, unadulterated 1.

i gave timecop a perfect 10, i gave this 1it's story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original timecop. lots of things from timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. this story is taking place in 2060 (if i remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them aren't... only the first one is great... and there aren't many action scenes at all, and they're all pretty shortat one point in the story, the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes... no wait, make that two times...in short: don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it

"everything a great documentary could be"?? yeah, if one is deaf, dumb, and blind. everything but meaning, wit, visual style, and interesting subject matter. aside from that. . .seriously, volken. this is a movie that is completely inauthentic. an adventure doc with no adventure, a war doc with no feeling for war, a campy send-up with no trace of wit. it means nothing, feels like nothing, and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. no wonder it has so many imdb fans! of course, going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture, no intelligence, no wit (other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness), and no recognizable human emotion  just adrenaline. "darkon" isn't a movie -- it's a panic attack! avoid. there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build-up such as "darkon".

the subject is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to "escape" from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence -- something almost everyone can relate to. the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings nerds and star trek enthusiasts. that's enough to get most people to watch. however, very quickly the film turns into an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who "don't get it". the filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming, and this particular one, waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords. it's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care. however, the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. moreover, the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them: a big no-no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.

this one is a real bomb. we are supposed to believe that merle oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the tom delay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. poor merle can't go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle harry davenport. she joins her two maids on a blind date and gary cooper happens to show up. some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things, a la "misfits," but no such luck with this one. gary later breaks in to a formal dinner, at which merle is presiding, and, though invited to sit down and join the group, reads them a lecture on their snobbery. where did this diffident cowboy's sudden eloquence come from? the most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife, merle. will it never end? one to avoid.

another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930's, resurrected by the magic of dvd.starring stock universal player lionel atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket. one kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and is proved "innocent" because he could not have spoken to witnesses.of course, where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? oh, well.atwill does a pretty good job here, faking being deaf and mute. unfortunately, no one else here can really act worth a darn.

uh oh! another gay film. this time it's showing the black side. bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending! but why? with only less than a half dozen exceptions, all gay films have to end in death or an "addio" finale. it's like all the european film noir releases in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's. the lead...male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. why in god's name must writers, directors, and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? after all, it's supposed to be gay...not glum. maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film. a large percentage of gay relationships do last and the couples do ride off together into the sunset! no matter who writes or produces, he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. this movie just proves my point. if you rent the dvd, take an antidepressant, for here comes another 'gay' film! this is wrong!

a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular. it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.if that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is. it's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). still, i mostly hated this.the film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace. three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored. but the director was there so i stayed. his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. i really wish i could like this more (there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but i can't. unless you're very interested in the harlem renaissance there's no reason to see this.

i watched this movie just a little while ago and i found that this movie was terrible! it moved very slowly and was hardly entertaining!sorry for all those that liked it.... this is only my opinion!

final score...who cares - it's a reality show. it has no love for it's audience, it panders to lazy tv viewers, puts nothing in and gets nothing out."joe millionaire", the most blatantly phony reality show of them all, is a television disaster of epic proportions. it's a watershed, rock bottom moment, not only for fox, but for the american viewing public who actually watch, like and talked about this crap the next day. you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves. because as much as fox promotes this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people (and boy was it, the finale got nearly super bowl numbers!?). it doesn't bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show?i used to be a staunch supporter of fox. it's those of us like me who like and seek out quality tv that helped build fox back in the days of married...with children and the simpsons. conveniently enough, now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management. the gail berman "reign of terror" as it's often called. the network has waged war on scripted tv and, strangely enough, it's fans. the very people who helped build them in the beginning. now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network. it boggles the mind. nothing fox, has done in the past 3 years makes any sense. from canceling hits like "titus", "futurama" and "john doe" (nbc can renew "boomtown", but fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot?). and the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like "joe millionaire". they can now say "we don't need you tv fans, we have reality shows". they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and will abandon them the second the next fad comes along. to alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back abc.the show itself is a joke. here we have a premise, in the now classic fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from "the bachelor" or anything on the big 3. fox has gone mainstream. the finale and "twist" (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve. now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will all end up the same cornball, fairy tale ending. we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head-shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this evan marriott because...well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do. marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured chro-magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences. but, how can the women (all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this) not fall for "joe" with such charming lines like "look, you're not stupid".i used to think that people who watched these reality/dating/game shows were just to lazy to change the channel, but after "joe millionaire" i think they must be genuinely mentally deficient. come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves. demand a little bit more from your entertainment then this.boycott fox.

you loose 100 iq points just for tuning in. this show has to be awful, i refuse to tune in from just what i've seen in commercials. where did they dig this guy up at anyway? also, what do they intend to do next season? the secret is out. everyone already knows the set up? are they going to look for people who has been living under a rock to star in next season? where are they going to dig up more stupid women? no wonder america is a big joke to outsider's,look what you are watching!!

what a piece of stupid tripe.i won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. it's not worth the time. the one comment i will make is - why get such a dumb, inarticulate doofus to be the star?!?there aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe (a decent series) but will bring back brain-dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public.fox has lost it, imho.

thanks to a dull, dimensionless screenplay by neil simon, and lackluster direction from robert moore, chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty(73), the goodbye girl(77), audrey rose(78) and only when i laugh(81);only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around. chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon's the cheap detective(78) and murder by death(76). caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and there's virtually no establishing detail. the first half is a less-than-captivating, meet cute, coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason, and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half. the nyc locations as well as joe bologna, and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. and last and least, there's an awful song played during the credits.

this agonizing comedy-drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979. i remember opening the movie-section of the l.a. times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for "chapter two" filled with glowing captions like: "better than 'the goodbye girl'!" and "neil simon does it again!" what does neil simon do? he takes an autobiographical situation (remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and--worst of all--unfunny. james caan plays neil--er..that is, george--a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife; enter spirited marsha mason (real-life mrs. simon...soon to be ex-mrs. simon) who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy. mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-plot concerning painfully-thin, blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt). i liked mason's outburst at the end ("i am wonderful! i am nuts about me!"), but i saw no happy ending for these two people...and time proved me right. ** from ****

tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite. there's a bit of subtext that might be about france's colonial past but it's mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things (like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers. sadly, that doesn't happen here. it looks good and the acting is fine and there's nothing really wrong with the concept but it's just so smug. god, does this movie love itself. pity it isn't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is. the only impetus in the show - sorry, movie - comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier, and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this. that's right: just like in a sitcom, which is what this is, with the added 'bonus' of delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time.

another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko's marvellous 1950 thriller "where danger loves". this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum, faith domergue and claude rains. crisply photographed in black & white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow. "where danger lives" is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood's past - (see my full review).unfortunately, none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc, the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension! poorly written (allen rivkin) and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by richard baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife (a risible audrey totter) is totally implausible and unconvincing (how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess). then when she "unsurprisingly" ditches him for one of her playmates (lloyd gough) our timid pharmacist, instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune, plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out. the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan (another bland performance). so who did kill him? well, at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry. mr. berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening. so much for that! a most unfortunate effort! c'est la vie!best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling, an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes. hey! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes! huh?in its favour however, are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers, commentaries and featurettes for both films. but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic!

the trouble with the book, "memoirs of a geisha" is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man's way of thinking. reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters.the movie isn't about japan or real geisha. it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha? is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? yes, but then why make it into an american fantasy?there were so many missed opportunities. imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups, no connotations of sin about sex. sex is natural and normal. how is sex handled in this movie? right. like it was dirty. the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? nope. one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha.did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? nope. she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. and that is what i mean about this movie. why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. he could have rigged the auction and won her himself. nobu didn't even bid. so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old-man stink, get his fingers all over her naked body? would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?let's try to make sense of this. by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri's geisha training. in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr. crab. through mameha the chairman sold sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her. the chairman wasn't her patron. he was her pimp! some romantic love story.yes, the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, alluring transvestite whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling. but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male. not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie, distortion, and terribly wrong.some contrasts between japan and moag:japanese style  refined, elegant simplicity. moag style  peking opera.japanese geisha  hair swept up. moag geisha  loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.japanese shaved ice - japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. moag shaved ice - the chairman buys chiyo, the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo, this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season. the thought made my entire body shiver with cold.japanese geisha  trained and skilled entertainers. moag geisha - sluts.japanese wind chime - used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes, thanks to the breeze, japanese people feel somehow cooler. moag wind chime - a door bell! if a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic, not gain entrance.japan  emphasis on human relationships, group oriented. moag  "i want a life that's mine" american individualism.japanese traditional dance  refined elegance. an almost geometrical and mechanical precision. moag dance  martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not-very-auspicious white japanese funeral shroud. performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? ha ha ha! is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?japan house fire  setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. fires can rip through those wooden villages, towns, and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. moag house fire - great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out. technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled.enough. the movie stinks.

"piece is cake" is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.in the march 1989 "aeroplane monthly", roland beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini-series. a few of his comments are worth repeating:"there was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that i saw in action, and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'piece of cake'. it would not have been tolerated for a moment... ...the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club, though with more discipline. nor was there any sense of 'death or glory'. raf training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we were required to do it - no more and no less."there was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice'. people either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did. but we knew fear, recognised it in ourselves and in each other, did our damnedness to control it, and then got on with the job..."...i could feel no 'glory', but there was a sense of greatness, and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'piece of cake'."beamont was, in his own words, "a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series, was there at the time".beamont served with 87 squadron both in france and the bob, before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the typhoon and tempest, and a post-war test pilot."piece of cake" is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time. it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace...

i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time. the movie was boring, long long and awful plot. the special effects sucks like hell - it's like watching a movie back in 1999. it's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. matthew settle's performance was quite bad. i saw him in band of brothers playing lt.speirs, he wasn't that bad. in fact not bad at all. but in this film, his acting wasn't convincing enough, it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either. plus, his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it. it surprised me, really, because he was good in band of brothers.anyway, don't even bother to watch this movie. it's a big big big waste of time. even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watching this movie. trust me, you'll regret it!

at first, three words: read the book! really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. it was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. the novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! that's only the surroundings. in the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! they screwed it up! ... i'll never watch it again!

if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country, "the celestine prophecy" is a good example: 1. perú, not even in its most violent times, has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film. this showed a country like el salvador when civil war. since i'm a peruvian who lives in lima (the capital of perú), it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here, there and everywhere. 2. if you have a car in perú, and you want (or need) to be a taxi driver, just post a sticker with the word "taxi" on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets (there are taxi companies, but their rates are quite expensive). no need of yellow or a black/white squared band on the doors of your car. well, taxis in this film have that band, somethin that you will never see in perú. 3. peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing. for example, when a taxi driver comes out, he was wearing a "guayabera" (cuban shirt), a white hat, and 40's mustaches, like clark gable. not one peruvian man looks like that, please! perú is not the caribbeans! 4. a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt, like the typical folklore dresses in latin america. take a walk anywhere in perú, and you'll never find a woman wearing like that, unless you are watching a typical dance. 5. cast could've been better: i can not deny héctor elizondo is a great actor, but he's not a latin actor (his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico, but he was born in new york) and his spanish is not fluent. it's notorious spanish is not his first language. there are dozens of very good latin actors who could've performed as cardinal sebastián. petrus antonius (general rodríguez) was also a bad choice for a "latin police officer". it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodríguez's office. they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class, making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish. unsuccessfully, of course. castulo guerra was better in his spanish. a "peruvian" officer, who announced cardinal sebastián, spoke a quite funny spanish too. there are very good peruvian actors, like augusto alvarez-calderón and christian meier (just to mention two out of many peruvian actors), who could've performed with excellence. 6. i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or, even, countries. but, please, when creating a name, be careful when using a foreign language: the town portrayed in this movie should've been called "vicente" and not "viciente". vicente is a male name, and viciente has never been used. 7. i disagree one user, who says that this movie was filmed on locations in perú. not one location is peruvian, although the production has used in excess posters showing "inca kola", the peruvian soda. as not few american films, this one must have used any latin country. after all, for american producers or directors, a latin place is identical to any other latin place. 8. in the first scenes, when john (matthew settle) flies to perú, he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in perú: jorge chávez airport (in lima, the capital). actually, believe me, it must be any airport in the world, but peruvian airport. and, of course, in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards. 9. when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel, this one has a fan and, obviously has no air conditioner. please, this doesn't happen in no hotel in perú(and other latin countries), unless you get a 1 star hotel! 10. the rebels who fight against the government are... ¡colombians! their accent was, with no doubt, from colombia. for casting them, the producers should've hired peruvian actors. in few words, it would've been cheaper filming in perú.i could go on with more examples out of this film, that led me to give it a "1" (awful) vote, but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning. but dear producers: it's not a tragedy: there are many worse movies with not few mistakes. just let's remember "indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull" and indescribable disney's "the emperor's new groove". the list of bad films could be endless...

i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of "spiritual" new age types, who, quite unlike me, very much enjoyed this movie---although according to those that also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the movie is not quite as good. so, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual", believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like "aura" and "astral body", and don't mind the frequent use of the term "energy" outside of the context of physics or technology, you might actually like the movie, and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on.however, if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based thereon, if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality, and perhaps even expect reasonable non-wooden dialog an acting, then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie: stay. away.don't even think about it. tonight, this movie displaced dungeons and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater (i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad, such as plan 9 etc.). at the same time, it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two (d&d being the other one). i do not walk out on movies, not even on this one, but i should've when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura, because the new age bs keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies, in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution. or something like that. they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution, which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe. the movie is shock full with whoppers like that. occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as "another dimension", or perhaps "another plane", only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment. goodness.at the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the "insights" making up the prophecy, painfully slow, presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better, more enlightened individuals.good things about the movie? some very pretty nature shots, and some decent supporting performances by elizondo and de almeida.i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable. it really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind, and unless that's your thing, you better do something else with your time and money.

i read the book and the book was fascinating.this movie, it's direction, the screenplay, and the acting were totally insufferable. i cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story.i can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. would not ever recommend this film to anyone i know. simply, one of he worst adaptations i have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth.the cinematography was indeed the only highlight. but, how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as peru. to prospective viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.

this movie is just not worth your time. its reliance upon new-age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. the plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times.i was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel. their motivation & objectivity is dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults, but at its well intentioned message of new age consciousness.so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians, or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies/television that support their views? in spite of the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? i hope not.i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.

this delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad film-making may not "open" you up, to borrow one of the film's favorite verbs, but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching. based on the best-selling book by james redfield, first (self) published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher (matthew settle) who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal. namely what he discovers is a schlock shangri la populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir. although there's a lot of talk about "energy," that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include thomas kretschmann, annabeth gish, hector elizondo and jurgen prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon. for those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the roman catholic church; armand mastroianni provided the inept direction while mr. redfield, barnet bain and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script. in short, easily the worst film seen in 40+ years of viewing movies.

i have just seen this movie and have not read the book. the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity and your part in the world.however, the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters. it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version. the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable. a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to. do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves (in little buddha) ? well, this is nothing like that.most scenes are poorly executed. there are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.the better actors in this movie, namely hector elizondo, joaquim de almeida and jürgen prochnow cannot save it. the first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help him at all. the scene where he first tries to convince john (matthew settle) to join him is just bad script. the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed. the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.overall this movie is a big waist of time, read the book! i have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than this, it has to be.it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb.

i will admit that i'm only a college student at this present time, an english major at that. at the time i saw this film i was a high school student--i want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like. i'm not a phd by any means.that said...this movie is simply terrible. it's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. my mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i'd seen with the films logic and science--and they are numerous--and she dismissed my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds." in this case, apparently so.leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film. leaving that behind, the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them.i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html

at first glance this documentary/fiction/cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking. of course, when something provokes thought, it can then be scrutinized. the reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions. the link that "what the bleep..." would have you see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. the transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area, washington d.c. in this case. in reality the hra (homicides, rapes, and assaults) crime rate was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992. there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. in fact, each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked.my conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. either way, i suggest that you do not waste your time.if you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts, you might consider mindwalk (1990).

i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. i found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). like others, i found this film to be an awful mix of "real" science and pseudoscientific, new age propaganda. as a psychologist, i was especially offended by candace pert's contributions. true, i was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the "consciousness" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ("consciousness") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. it is an old orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay "politics and the english language." to refer to "consciousness" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as "based in science" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave-states "democratic republics" and hitler when he called his party a "socialist workers" movement.i don't claim to really understand quantum physics. i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. ah, but we americans do love "instant enlightenment," and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. if it asked questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).by the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several "expert commentators" with the maharishi mahesh yogi (and tm), not to mention j.z. knight, who often speaks in her "ramtha" voice. (i'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. but then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10,000 years ago, i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? oh, i forgot, i'm the creator of "good" and "bad" advice, so it's all my fault, not ramtha's.)what a mess.

another cult strikes again. this isn't a spoiler, because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercial...ramtha's school of enlightenment.when any religion/philosophy needs to hide behind an oz-like screen of deceit, i walk away. thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend"...to have wasted precious resources on this new-age lobotomizer would have been tragic. i can only hope that they "truly believe they can walk on water" enough to take that guidance to it's "logical" conclusion...in other words; walk, drown...or shut up :-) as a movie...it deserves a strong "1" on it's entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographer's roommate...eeeeeek!). if you must see this film, borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it.

"what the bleep do we know!?" was one of the worst times i have spent at the movies. it was less of a movie and more of an after school special, but at the same time nothing special at all. the attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost anyone will tell you. marlee matlin in her underwear just shouldn't happen. i won't dwell on it. what i will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. this movie, while tedious, also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning. it was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative, become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shoeless piece of propaganda. interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence. however, the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds. it completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us, which seems to be more the case. or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us. in this way, the movie was inappropriately solipsistic. solipsism and interconnectivity just don't mix unless you're god almighty. if you are, you will be impressed (?!?) by all the neat things this movie will reveal that you can do. if not, you will be sorely disappointed, a moron, or perhaps both. also, the title is so ridiculous, i have trouble warning people not to see the movie because i feel retarded mentioning it by name. shame on everyone involved.

if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $9 on a used textbook, not this movie. i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana. i don't think the directors really got any point across, but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several: 1) science can explain everything we do, meaning that our lives are deterministic; 2) science can't be used to explain everything we do, meaning that we have free will; 3) science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) we are god; 5) the world exists only in our minds; 6) sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff.

if you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch "waking life," which is brilliant. "what the #$*! do we know" is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. it wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. the inclusion of that rambling freak "ramtha" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old atlantian god or something? what a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.

a definite no. a resounding no. this movie is an absolute dud.having been recommended to me by a friend very much into "that sort of thing," i watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed, changed, moved, altered, uplifted, and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when i suddenly see the truth. now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo-pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical, the metaphysical/physical boundaries of existence. believe me, i am not such a person. i try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.in terms of content, the only thing i found mildly interesting and informative, was the bit about peptides, emotions, addiction, and cellular receptors. that was the only "unifying" element i could find in the documentary part of this film. the rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere, try to tie up and conclude to a point. and what was all that stuff about native americans not being able to see the ships that columbus came in? who told the "authorities" in this film that that was what happened in 1492? where they there too? had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition (the famous gorilla video, for example, visit the visual cognition lab at the university of illinois site) there may have been a more convincing point made. here, however, it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo-jumbo.as a film: this wasn't one film, it was two. i found the documentary part mildly interesting, just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about (i was annoyed that their credentials weren't presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke, at least initially!) but i found the "story" part of the movie with matlin in it annoying, disjointed, intrusive, non-related and downright stupid. that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny. it was laughable, ludicrous, sophomoric, and stupid. and i found the use of the word "pollack" offensive. it just seemed so out of place and wrong. is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group? that may be okay to make a point, but it didn't seem to be used that way here. and in any case, i don't care what the reason, it offended me, a pole. i never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as "pollack." and i certainly don't like like it when others do. can i watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used? you betcha! but again this didn't seem to be the case here. it just seemed so out of place. unprovocked, unmitigated.the acting was abysmal. elaine hendrix's performance was totally unbelievable. at times, it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her. marlee matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing. perhaps she was baffled by the material. i know i was. if she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged-up anxiety-prone malcontent, it just didn't seem to click. but by far, the world's worst was hendrix! all in all, i found this a disjointed, poorly acted piece of clap-trap.

i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent "short history of nearly everything" and what i was able to choke down in "a brief history of time," it sounded interesting at times. however, the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually "channelling" some loony named "ramtha" completely upset the applecart for me.what a waste of two hours.

if you're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory, read "the elegant universe" by brian greene of columbia university, and "the universe in a nutshell" by stephen hawking of cambridge.recipe for #$*!:3 parts bombastic new age pontificator, 2 parts pseudoscientist, 2 parts real scientistmix together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance.serving suggestion: barf bags.

well, what can i say."what the bleep do we know" has achieved the nearly impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as "the postman", "the dungeon master", "merlin", and so fourth, it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive indeed, for i have seen many a bad movie.this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new-agy pseudo-philosophy. basically, if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g, this movie is for you. if you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a sizable portion of good weed, then this movie is for you as well. otherwise, stay away. take my word for it.the first thing that struck me about "what the bleep do you know" is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparkles across the screen, and other assorted silliness. who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you. the movie was permeated with cheesy gci, the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over-the-counter video editing software, but never would, because it's just way too ridiculous.the script was _obviously_ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever. not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief, but the "writers" felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this movie was all about, all the way down your throat. well, given the target audience, that may not have been too bad of an idea. the main character, for example, spends half the movie popping pills. apparently, though, it was deemed not convincing enough, so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout, which refer to her anti-anxiety pills specifically, just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down. the acting... well, i've seen better acting in ed wood movies, and no, this is not an exaggeration. heck, the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this. it really did.the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors, and self-proclaimed mystics, go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. reality, you see, is a probability-field of a bunch of different possibilities, and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it. what happens when more than one observer observes they didn't say, but then again who cares. listen to enya, meditate, observe, and you shall be god, and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". furthermore, the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities, parallel universes, and such.speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the movie. all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes. i'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing, but one thing i'm certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex. actually, the movie is _extremely_ anti-sex. throughout, sex is presented as dirty, ugly, and anti-enlightening.in any case, the talking heads talk, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker, and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with.i want 2 hours of my life back.here's a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember:"what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me, and that, which i used to consider real, is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal." - some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics."what does it take for one man to have an erection? it takes just one thought. nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are within. an yet he has an erection" - some self proclaimed mystic, head of her own school of enlightenment.[while looking at herself in the mirror] "i hate you! i hate you! you're fat! you're ugly! i have you!" - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.

i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom. we (my g-friend and i) walked out about an hour into it. what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon.sub atomic particles are thoughts? by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals? a drop of 25% in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated. wow, what a rigorous scientific study. i'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time. should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate? hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! btw- it was funded by the ramtha cult, the leader of which was one of the "experts" which were interview by the filmmakers. no ulterior motives here, right?

remember the chain-smoking channeler exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago? this is her. lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers. the producers have been using phony "word of mouth" promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe. if you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age dreck and day-old baloney, this film is for you. if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn't a wacko, so you'll give her a bunch of your money. if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman>

anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after 40 min., as my wife and i did. the ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand-waiving arguments and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without even an attempt at a logical reason) from real science. i'm offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science". i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book, didn't understand a word of it, then watched the matrix about a thousand times, and proceeded to write this movie.for example, the washington dc crime experiment was done by the transcendental meditation program. a brief search will reveal the science of their methods.

it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was. consequently, they had even more trouble delivering it. they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub-atomic particles. having established a fuzzy picture of heisenberg's uncertainty principle, they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale. then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen covey and tony robbins have made their careers: positive thinking, interrupting bad patterns, always look on the bright side, etc. next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins: hormones which we more or less choose to create. if you are sad, you will create sad proteins. if you are happy, you will create happy proteins. it's just so simple, isn't it? interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of amanda, a photographer who pops anti-depressants and hates her thighs. the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say, "hey, amanda, just cheer up!" why can't she cheer up? obviously it's because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion, that's why. the conclusion of the film (which is basically the entire second half) brought on a barrage of contradiction. we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings, but a collective consciousness, but we are individuals who can change the world, but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions, but we can choose who we are, and we have a purpose to do good, but there is no god because there is nothing better than us, so there is no such thing as right and wrong, so there is no such thing as reward or punishment, so nothing good ever came out of religion, but we should still do good anyway, even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is, except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate, and then crime will cease, and if we say nice things, our water will freeze into pretty shapes. still with me? good because there is more. according to robert l. park in his book "voodoo science", the whole meditation experiment put on by john hagelin in washington, d.c. was a farce, the numbers were doctored, and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since. and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy? this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight.so does all this work or not? i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where betsy chasse, one of the film's three directors (yes, three) fielded questions following the show. i call myself lucky because i had first-hand confirmation that these people don't know what they are talking about. several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband, a chiropractor, had to step in and recite the answer. i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political, and everyone, including ms. chasse, began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie.

this movie made me very angry. i wanted desperately to throttle the "scientists" and unseen film-makers during the course of it. very, very painful to sit through. sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. the little good information on brain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh*t. the worst offenders were the crack-pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza. mr. dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, is living on a higher plane. even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them. i think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they've taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum. much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. fittingly, the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and cliché ridden.i would refer people instead to bill bryson's excellent survey of science: "a brief history of nearly everything." there's plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual, established science.

as a physics student, i've become aware of many idiot professors, and other so-called experts, in the field. as i continue with my studies, i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on, and about the people who are doing things right.then, my friends tell me of this "physics movie" they want to see. knowing nothing of it, i'm excited, hoping that the information will be presented well.i've done real quantum mechanics; this wasn't it.this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can, and will, occur to you, if you just open your eyes. let's think about that, for just a moment.our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. that is a million billion billion billion particles! the more "mysterious" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely. as you add more and more particles into the mix, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, with no rationality behind it...it's just stupid.my friend, also in physics, and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie. but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen.i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie, as i have not had any kind of medical training. it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it, remembering my days in biology, but i cannot say.at least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all different types of personalities "driven" by their peptides*, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by cg peptides, and a fully cg scene, filled with dancing peptides. the film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we're "addicted to emotions," so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit, "addicted to love."this scene was redeeming, because anyone who could go through that scene, and still take this movie seriously...well, you are the ones that need to "open your eyes."

i had numerous problems with this film.it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics, which is fine. although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying: "aren't you just blown away by this!" well, not really. these aren't earth shattering revelations anymore. at any rate, i was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations, etc. is not new.the main problem i have with this movie, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. i don't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics doesn't really have anything to do with these things, and it should be kept separate. the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you, hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. the reasoning is completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. for every so called "expert" that they interviewed for this film, there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree. they would point out, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness.it disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. the main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments.avoid this film.oh yeah. at one point, one of the "experts" says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false, therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false. huh? that totally does not follow. and even if it did, i don't see how that helps his argument. i mean, if his ideas ever became common assumptions then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too, based on his own reasoning.

suffice it to say that this substandard b has nothing to save it - not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor. josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters. do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store.

a question for you : a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . which film am i talking about ? every horror film you`ve seen ? yes that`s true but that`s not the answer i`m looking for . i`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . doesn`t help ? well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s pov . no futher forward ? okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? could still be any horror film you say . oh gawd this could take weeks so i`ll say the film i`m talking about features loads of aussies many of whom have appeared in neighbours and home and away . yes that`s right the film is the third circle ( aka cubbyhouse ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? it`s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made

having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. davy crockett was very poorly represented by billy bob, who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam houston given both men's love of oratory. i think self-absorbed dennis quaid(an actual texan) would have been a perfect crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship. as a texan and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel davy crockett was the quintessential texan even though not born here. our unofficial motto is "it ain't braggin' if it is a fact" was made for crockett. and that last scene at the alamo where crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to davy crockett ever made. to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texicans vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained mexican regulars. every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during siesta time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand.

the wife of a stage producer in london hopes to fix up the american song-and-dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an american girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles. unfortunately, the couple has already met on their own, with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend (the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings!). wafty fred astaire-ginger rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by dwight taylor and allan scott's idiotic script, which is full of juvenile behavior. astaire and rogers don't just 'meet cute'--they meet ridiculously (he's tap-dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains). audiences of 1935 probably didn't care how these two were going to get together--as long as they did so, and happily. seen today, the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he plies her with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain "fancy free" in the love department) and she gives him the brush-off. nothing that a little dancing couldn't cure! this glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the london and venice settings, but we watch simply because the leads are fred and ginger. it's a fantasy for have-nots...ones who don't mind the dumbed-down plot. the musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario, yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness. ** from ****

the proverb "never judge a book by it's cover", was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface. as i viewed the artwork to,"king of the ants" i instantly thought horror! the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution. instead what i discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock."king of the ants" features chris l. mckenna as sean crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. except sean crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. in fact he's downright unlikable, but not as much as daniel baldwin (ray mathews)who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp. in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and george wendt as duke, which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean!now there are a couple of interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world. it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue, and unlikely event after unlikely event. oh the horror!

i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie. jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. the acting was below average most of the time, especially by mckenna. i haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone "badass" in a movie. oh man, this movie was a letdown. i also read somewhere this might be a cult classic. i know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just a average piece of film.the script was lame, for the most part the acting was lame, this movie was lame.oh and pray for the guy that used to be in cheers. he looks really bad. the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.4/10

i don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so i hadn't brought any prejudices to the film. based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting.but implausibility was piled upon implausibility. each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed, gruesome makeup, or special effects.the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing. it was positively repulsive.i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but i'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore.chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim (wendt) out of the deep freeze. mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck. now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt's demise. (what are the cops going to do, measure his bite radius?) mckenna unwraps wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in, takes an ax, and begins to chop off wendt's head. whack. whack. whack. the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendt's neck. the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh, one of which drops on mckenna's head. (he brushes it off when he's done.) mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built. he sits the head on the ground, squats next to it, takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed, and shows them to wendt's head. "remember her? we could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys," he tells the head. "duke, you've always liked bonfires, haven't you?" he asks. then he places the head on the fire. we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame.i don't want this sort of garbage to be censored. i'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff.there's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie. well, i'll mention one example of an "implausibility," since i brought the idea up. mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack. he knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days. (he's literally invited the heavies to do it.) what would you do in this poe-like situation? here's what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life. he finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates (successfully). give that man the medal of freedom! a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. the camera is often hand held and wobbly. the dialog has lines like, "life is a piece of s***. or else it's the best of all possible worlds. it depends on your point of view." use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, mckenna, walks towards us in the foreground.some hero he is, too. he first kills a man for $13,000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body. (this bothers him a little, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment.) then, i hope i have the order straight, he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck. then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it, although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it. next he burns the head honcho (baldwin) alive. then, having disabled the two lesser heavies, he deliberately blows them up, though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic. and we're supposed to be rooting for mckenna.these aren't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either -- bang bang and you're dead. these are slow and painful. the first one -- the murder for $13,000 -- is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life. it isn't really easy to kill another human being, as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain. but that scene leads to no place of any importance.some people might enjoy this, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies. some meretricious stuff on screen here.

a film without conscience. drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. then they double cross him. meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife, and, without her knowing he's the killer, moves in with her. then he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. then, in a walking tall kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him. the first problem is that, by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment, the drifter loses all sense of sympathy, worthiness, and heroism. we can't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center. we just can't care about that kind of guy. and the wife (nicely played by the fetching kari wuhrer - the sheriff in eight legged freaks), a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people, similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter (despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband). and, when she finds out he's the guy  what does she do? she locks him inside her house (as if all houses had locks you can't open from inside) with her and proceeds to berate him. stoo-pid. george wendt, however, is terrific in a role as a beefy thug. director stuart gordon did so much better with re-animator and dagon.

i was p***ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year, so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, i put it on remind as soon as i could. so was it worth the wait? well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot. sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is. enter duke (george wendt) who introduces him to his boss ray (danny baldwin). one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around. and it goes on from there. which leads me back to the question posed. was it worth the wait? yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me. he just took the ball and ran with it. but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. i know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without spoiling the film. but needless to say it happened. the ending doesn't save the film either. poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like "re-animator" or "castle freak".my grade: cwhere i saw it: showtime extremeeye candy: kari wuhrer shows her ta-tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta-tas and it pans down and...oh my god my eyes my eyes!!!!!

i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful. an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man? this movie was rife with absurdities of which if i mentioned them all i would be giving away the movie. norm peterson aka george wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie. the acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. as a sane minded and rational individual, i could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie. there was ineptness on the part of every main character, there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie, it only makes a talkative train wreck.

this movie is written by charlie higson, who has before this done the "legendary" fast show and his own show based on one of fast show's characters (tony the car sales man). he's also written james bond books for kids.actually i've seen before this only gordon's movies that are based on lovecraft's stories, and every one of those is marvelous. here gordon tries to do something different. the style is totally "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. it works quite well here, i guess, but it's still pointless and cheap. it makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable would come out of it). the casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good directing. i think the main character, the "zero" young guy, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". the fat guy is also good. and the guy who looks like alec baldwin, but is not him. but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting: in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness. there is not much humanity in this film/story: it's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. needless to say that there is no humor either. it's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment. anyway, gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today, and i think of this movie as an experiment, and as a failure in that. everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes, just to learn and to find their way again. this might be gordon's most uninteresting and empty work.

this movie was an attempt to go into places most don't and perhaps shouldn't venture into. it was a similar trial at the bizarre, head-case perspective given to us in the cell, although not near as in-depth and well portrayed. the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it. then, as the movie takes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place. basically the idea is that of a kid (chris mckenna) who needs money. he takes on the role of a hit man, killing a city accountant. then he doesn't get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the "brilliant" idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment. this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused. he begins to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). then, thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over, he visits the wife (kari wuhrer) of the man who he killed and wins her affections. soon after she discovers who he is, tragedy strikes, and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers (daniel baldwin, george wendt, vernon wells) for their previous "kindness".i got to ask though, what is it with kari wuhrer and horror/gore type films?it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre. granted, i liked her in "eight-legged freaks" and she was okay in "anaconda". but despite all her obvious cuteness and allure (wow, she's hot!), she can act much better and chose better roles. or maybe, i'm wrong and that is just a misconception. for all you guys out there, you get to see the "fully monty" of her in this film, although it's rather bizarre and short-lived. i almost felt like she did some soft-porn after watching this film (something not foreign to kari's career). the sex-simulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming. anyway, i will say there is some good acting. just don't expect much of it from daniel balwin, whose career seems forever destined to second his brother alex's. the film did bring out a few old greats though, george wendt (norm from cheers) and vernon wells (commando, weird science). above all, chris mckenna does the best job in playing the main character, sean crawley. his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth, bring some elements of substance to the film. i wouldn't go out of my way for this one. if you're bored and are tired of the same old episodes of "the hitchhiker", then i might advise watching this.and kari, please start acting in some better films!

you can't imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants. as a massive gordon fan, i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipation.especially since i loved dagon - gordon's last achievement - so much. king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it. unfortunately, i couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards. king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. really, the quality level never surpassed ordinary tv-thriller standards. the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical gordon-touch is never recognized. on top of that, the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese! it involves a young wannabe-crook who's hired to commit a murder. so he does.and of course they're not paying him.and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife.and of course he avenges himself.. only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a stuart gordon film. the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife, george `norm peterson' wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the make-up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur-horror fans. i read a few other comments on king of the ants, claiming it's gordon's best since it finally is a thought-provoking and mature film.well, if that's the case.i rather stay immature and give re-animator another viewing, thank you very much. oh well, i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually.too bad it also overcame stuart gordon.

i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; "rated r for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language".which correctly, imo, should state ; "rated r for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language".the word "sexuality" should come after a "comma", not an "and" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non-existent. my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like "vivid" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't.of course, this is only my opinion.joseph

this was a crappy movie, with a whole lotta non-sense and too many loose-ends to count. i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors (ron livingston) made a cameo in it, and i continued watching it because as a girl, i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change. later, i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get, and each time it got...more... ridiculous.sean crawley (good-looking chris l. mckenna, whom i've never seen before - but loved his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter, when he meets electrician duke wayne (george wendt from "cheers"). thinking he's getting more work from duke, sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews (daniel baldwin, playing a stereotypically evil guy). ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant (ron livingston in a cameo, who i've been in love with from "office space" up to "sex & the city"). ray end up offering the apparently desperate-for- cash sean $13k to kill the accountant, and sean accepts the job. sean stalks out the accountant, whose wife (kari wuhrer) he finds himself attracted to, completes the hit, and leaves - taking the file of information against ray with him. sean quickly learns he was being used, that ray never intended to pay him, and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.up to this point, it's a descent flick...generally worth watching. but as soon as ray, duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him, it just got dumber and dumber (and still dumber...), until finally it seemed like the film's writer, charlie higson, had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something. without simply detailing the movie, let's just say that in every-single-scene you watch after the kidnapping, you find yourself gasping "what the f**k!," baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption. in the end, so many loose-ends are left in the movie, that you begin to regret that you even watched it.this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable, and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it's full value. it's supposed to be a psychological thriller, and mckenna is a decent actor, but it's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have "norm" from "cheers" and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work, and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense. guys will love the violence, blood and guts scenes, and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. girls will enjoy handsome sean's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie, when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie. personally, i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks (ron livingston) is only in the first one-third of the movie.

i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast. i have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this sort of low-budget b movie. she is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in. this is no different. the film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesn't make it good. george wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. another note about ms. wuhrer. her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last. perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. this not a bad thing. she still looks great. i would like to see her in a better movie.

i guess it's jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is, but empathy comes at a price like all things-when he's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. he is a joke as a mafia-hit-man(also because the part doesn't suit him one bit, him being so extroverted)and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this.kathleen turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde, because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes, when she opens them wide which she's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and anjelica huston is the absolute same(granted interesting) in everything, just like robert loggia. the movie is a lame draft(and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster-movie, with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster(they certainly gathered the party-going elite in this). what, did they shoot it in 1 day?-cause that would be the only explanation.

with a cast of stalwart british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain, i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - i couldn't quite believe how awful it was. i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time, but this was really hard going.as others have noted, a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. i was a bit gobsmacked when jeannie carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in! it's not believable on any level, either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time. other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave donald sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for god's sake!), the fact he has diana dors for a fiancée and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her (i mean, diana dors! come on!) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher's office. the whole thing's silly in the worst possible way.if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor wilfred lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way.

of course, "flatley" is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but i think michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title: "feet of flames" one really can't resist recommending desenex foot spray to the retiring (and clearly, ailing) flatley.i might add that, much like that cheering london crowd (per review below), i too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance."hinting that it may be his last live performance, flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic london crowd." ~ perry seibert, all movie guide

this was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to fulfil local content quotas. the writing was truly terrible and i'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the honerable wally norman.nothing about this tv series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing. it was just tired and bad and, worst of all, it really thought it was funny. it was simply embarrassing to watch.there is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on imdb. try to find a (real) review by a (real) australian viewer of the show (there weren't many) and it is impossible. or crazy. there are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show. avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd, remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional.

there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: 1) the people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are serbs or of serbian origin, therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. for instance, they mentioned that the diaspora croats (the so called "ustase") played a huge part in the fall of yugoslavia, but they didn't mention that there were equal serbian organizations as well (cetniks)! for you who aren't that familiar with balkan ww2 history: the serbian so called "cetniks" that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british paratroops during the war. well, that's only half the truth. they were also a fascist (monarch) group who collaborated with the germans, but then switched side when hitler started losing the war. it's also ironic that they don't mention the cetnik leader mihajlovic in the documentary, a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over bosnia and croatia. but they mentioned a certain ante pavelic...hm...allow me to be just a little suspicious.2) most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. and i've studied this war for a long time (who is the old british lady!!! she really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name, so they could more or less be anybody, maybe someone they took from the street. who knows.3) in the documentary they talk about kosovo and how the serbs have lived there for ages, and therefore it should belong to serbia (even though they are a minority). well, when they mention the serbian dominated part of croatia (krajina) suddenly the serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. fine, but what people don't know is that the largest city in krajina (knin) has great historical importance for the croatian people. it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of croatian history (zvonimir) was crowned, and therefore the city has a historical value for croatia. the serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! but no, the serbs should have krajina and kosovo according to the documentary. is that fair? to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. plus, it is said in the documentary that the croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights, this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented because of the fact that croatia had a huge serbian minority.4) the film mentions a radical croatian paramilitarian leader called glavas. or the muslim radical oric. they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. yes, they were radicals, but if you want to talk about radicals, why not also mention the serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as seselj and arkan? the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them, just so that people get an overview of the documentary. it looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the serbs because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something. there aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality, but the best so far is "the death of yugoslavia" where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. milosevic, jovic, bulatovic, tudman, izetbegovic, karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of yugoslavia and the war.one other thing. i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country (bosnia) that had connections with bin laden during the war. well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the bosnian muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called "muslim croats") they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: their religion. and they took help from the mujahedin because no one else would support them. they had to fight the 4:th largest army in europe! they needed all the help they could get. nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war. history has shown us that.

i just want to say that this production is very one sided, breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously. there are no credits of the persons they interviewed, so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard.tells the story from just one point of view. to do this is very dangerous, because the next generations learns the bad idea, and thats why wars keep coming. i know this is not the only reason about wars, but doesn't help either.you can watch this documentary, but read in the internet a lot, before. balcans are complex as human history is.

when i saw this "documentary", i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again. even though serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of yugoslavian breakup, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", which is made by bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective. it is one in the set of lies pushed by milosevic regime. everyone else is guilty only serbians were right and victims, even though most of the war criminals tried in hague are serbs, even though serbs are one who have committed genocide against bosnians , and attacked slovenia, croatia,and bosnia all independent nations recognized by the un.breakup of yugoslavia was not avoidable because serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on federal yugoslav government, so slovenia, croatia, macedonia, and bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests.if you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of yugoslavia, and fact led documentary this is not it . you should watch "yugoslavia:death of a nation", made by discovery channel and bbc.

before seeing this movie, please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's falsification of events, particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 muslim men were bused out of srebrenica and shot by serbian paramilitaries. the documentarian also belongs to various pro-serbian american organizations. please watch this movie critically, and read reviews beforehand. most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far, even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war. a review in the nytimes by stephen holden states that it would be "inaccurate to label this documentary pro-serbian," but one should question both the presentation of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of those facts that inculpate serbian forces. i do not advise against seeing this documentary, but i do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye (as one should do at all times anyway).

don't watch this serbian documentary and serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/the death of yugoslavia documentary series (of five episodes) is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass-bloodshed which marked the end of the old federal yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990's. it includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both "yugoslav" and otherwise. the only real "improvement" which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the balkans since the program was made. this was indeed done in the late 1990's for a repeat showing on bbc television, but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work. perhaps another whole episode might be warranted? the very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term "yugoslavia" by the now-named federal republic of serbia and montenegro - a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before.not fiction like in "yugoslavia: the avoidable war (1999)"

first of all, i apologize for my english. everybody from ex-yugoslavia who isn't some extreme serbian radical will agree with me. this movie, shows serbian side, and only serbian side. no serbian crimes were represented. luckily, everyone can see that this movie was made by serbians, so there is no neutrality. all ''professionals'' who were interviewed are not professionals at all. some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian, the other one is genocide denier etc.etc.even slovenians were accused in this movie.and the whole war in slovenia lasted for few days, and only because slovenians were lucky.there weren't many serbs in slovenia, and yna couldn't reach slovenia trough croatia (after croatia-serbia war started). every slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie. every reasonable croat will agree with one thing: the independence was too early. perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided. however, mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington, and saying that was justified by hiroshima and nagasaki. you will find no evidence about strangled yna soldier, and murdered serbian civilians near vukovar. but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near vukovar were lies. all over the internet. and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of vukovar by yna (now on serbian and montenegro side-and 100% full of serbs and montenegrin) and let's not start about the chetnik movement. at the beginning, it was simply a resistance movement. but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis, including ustashe, ethnic cleansing, and fighting again the yugoslav partisans. there are thousands of other things, but all of it can be easily checked. there are many misleading things in this movie. only few of all accusations are true. every croatian is outraged by this movie. i believe that i don't need to mention srebrenica genocide denial, the genocide that has too many evidence. imagine the movie about holocaust denial. this movie is the same. and according to this movie bosnian muslims in sarajevo bombed themselves. every bosnian muslim is outraged by this movie. somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of macedonian (fyrom) land by the serbs. croatians, slovenians, bosnians, and macedonians never entered serbian borders. if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie, know that serbs have some kind of propaganda that croats, bosnian muslims, and macedonians are actually serbs who made up their history. so...even 50% of serbs will say that this movie is ''little'' extreme and pro-serbian. and serbian radicals are very, very pleased with this movie (there is about 40% serbs who vote for radicals).i think everyone understands my points in here. in this so called documentary is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: inform yourself before watching this movie. after that, you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations.watch real, neutral documentaries about death of yugoslavia.

this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed. the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere. this is a drama, but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was. that's never a good sign. the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien's roommates/bandmates. they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously. the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd. the soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. unless you're one of those crazy, rabid dominic monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.

when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll, and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his "character" movies, but it was my ambition to own them, too. what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen-year-old i must have been. thankfully sense prevailed and live a little, love a little is the only elvis film i own.the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single. (his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years  his first uk no.1 in 25) even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren't exactly first rate. however, a little less conversation - rollnecks and 60s grooving aside - is a real standout. finding a lesser-known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions. it's nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated, but it's also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult. (and what chauvinistic lyrics, too. though what other elvis song contains the word "procrastinate"?)but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it. actually based on a novel (kiss my firm but pliant lips - what kind of lame novel would that be?) this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a "comedy" dog and a nympho. within 90 seconds of meeting him, michele carey asks "would you like to make love to me?" quite a fast mover by any standards i'm sure you'll agree.i do seem to recall that some of elvis's early movies - most notably jailhouse rock and king creole - weren't too bad, but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers. being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts, causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh, and models dress as pink mermaids. there's even a dream sequence for god's sake. maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn't conform to is in not having all that many songs. with just four to choose from, including the credits number, you're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks. some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes, but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain. of the remaining three tracks, then the edge of reality isn't actually that bad, though elvis's dance to it must surely have been called "the bear trap".in one sense, for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content. sadly, however, with talking dogs, middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you'll ever see, elvis's dignity is obliterated by this movie.

a half-hearted attempt to bring elvis presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-playboy magazine subplot, presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clichés. a woman picks e.p. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life--and he doesn't seem to care! dick sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but don porter and rudy vallee (!) try hard as elvis' two bosses (he's moonlighting, you see). some of the songs are quite good, especially "almost in love", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated elvis sex-comedy--look elsewhere. when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together, there's actually a wooden board in between them! get real. ** from ****

if i write a review about a movie, maybe it will stick with me... but generally i expect that i will have forgotten i've seen this one a mere two weeks from now. so why bother? because again i find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. i didn't expect i'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on.it wasn't great, but at least it was not unbearable... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe. it was just sweet fluff... and if you can't take it, stay in the locker room boys. i agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic, and won't be a total bore to an adult.it offers a few good chuckles here and there, but nary a side splitter. sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining, but at least it doesn't suck (as so many have said it does). maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides? i have a tendency to grade on the bell curve, so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book. giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing. giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. i cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff (or that i am even bothering to write about it). am i missing something? anyway, it should be noted that emma roberts performs her role as clairedycat quite convincingly. ariell kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due. you might also recognize bruce spence playing leonard, though his role is ancillary.surely you can miss this one if you are an adult. but, if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her... and be prepared not to hate it (you might even enjoy it).

i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. this movie has the worst acting since killjoy.here is a brief outline of the plot: the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach, drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach "hunk" who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life. somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. uh oh! here comes the competition! the stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. we soon find out jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in australia, which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, i think i'm gonna cry). a huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yup, you guessed it, a mermaid! this is where the "story" really takes off. basically, they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the "hunk".this is a preteen flick with acting so bad, it makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of oscar-worthy performances. this movie has all the clichés possible... the best friends, the "hunk" who everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man... you name it, it's in there. i took one for a lot of people by watching this. consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you. please, don't see this movie. don't make it so i suffered in vain.

you like beautiful girls? yeah me too. what is there bad to say about beautiful girls/women? nothing imo, so why would i give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it got the "talents" of chiaki kuriyama and aya ueto? if i really wanted to watch beautiful people, i'd watch mtv or something that's why. this is a movie, a so called action movie nevertheless. so by definition it does not even really need a plot right? i'm not agreeing 100%, but let's say yes to that. so what does it need? 20 minutes footage from part 1 (i might be exaggerating a little bit, but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)?! that would be "no". but then again you never know, the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so hey let's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice? just to be sure they won't forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course!!!! so forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about the "acting" (and no, i don't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting!) ... what does that leave? yes the action scenes. the action scenes are not bad and that's the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! i was giving this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... you have better things to do/watch, believe me ...

there's no denying the first azumi film was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young, attractive actors and certainly wasn't lacking in the budget department. yet it more than entertained for what it was, and i can't deny i enjoyed it immensely."azumi 2" lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful. the first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb ryuhei kitamura at the helm. with him, he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics, but the originals style, beauty and most importantly, its heart. while the first had a simple "hitlist" plot, this one has a corkscrew mess of a story, with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated. gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters; azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest. characterisation is non existent; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies, i'll be shocked. the same applies to the villains here. the final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension. the fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness. the villains themselves try far too hard to be campy, and even if they were all combined, they don't come within a country mile of the pete burnsian antics of jo odagiri in the original.####major spoiler at end of paragraph!##### aya ueto tries her best it has to be said, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. azumi is now a fully fledged assassin, meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of man with no name style mysteriousness, ueto's model looks become even more inappropriate. i know this is supposed to be the point, but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around. the less said about chiaki "remember me from kill bill" kuriyama's performance the better; it suffices to say her "turn" from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm.overall, this was just a colossal disappointment. any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film. a lazy, unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess.

the movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (i'm sorry i'm biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1. i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. i amazed myself being able to sit through it. lets talk about the plus points of the movie. the girl. ueto aya is cute. thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. the fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. now lets talk about the minus points. firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back. it seems more like a drama way of shooting. typical japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. i do not mind unrealistic movies. but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of shinobi, though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. moreover, to portray "i-don't-know" what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... too many of these spoils the show. it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. it degrades the show greatly. thirdly, isn't azumi supposed to be an assassin. she seems more like an one-man-army to me, just that she is a female. i don't think you see assassins charging into army camps. the only time i felt she acted "assassin-liked" was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1. lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.

i loved the first "azumi" movie. i've seen ms. ueto in a variety of her tv appearances and i've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. i have to say that this movie was much weaker than i'd expected.given the movie's cast and set up in "azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in parts, and sprinkled with very poor, unconvincing, and wooden acting.when they bothered to reference the first movie, they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak. in "azumi", the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. in "azumi 2" she seems somehow diminished and less-impressive.that's not to say it was a total loss. there were a few decent fight scenes and some over-the-top characters. unfortunately, the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that shusuke kaneko and yoshiaki kawajiri are not ryuhei kitamura and isao kiriyama. the latter two truly captured the "manga" feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite "got it."

i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly. so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2, but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. the pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise (if that is possible!). i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment. there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. the fight with the spider guy (straight out of an episode of monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam!! azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but aya still does an okay job. she looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? i don't think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.

the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi's fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.that's as poetical as i'll get when talking about azumi 2: death or love, because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. but i won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. by the way, chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.this brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'death' side of the epic. in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. to no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. in azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, i won't lie and i'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film, but i'll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. for what it's worth, azumi 2: death or love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.

i am so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny... and i thought "mulan" was unbelievable! however low my expectations of disney have become, i never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off. there is no respect here for any true chinese culture, just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts.i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl... but, fortunately, most normal teenage girls--particularly asian teenage girls--are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. and from a cultural stand point, it's almost impossible. yes, there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion, but they're pretty rare. and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars. another stereotype, maybe, but a fairly true one. because that's how chinese parents work. that's how chinese values work. if they wanted to go for authenticity, they would've made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family.this just adds to my frustration with american movies. asian culture isn't about meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. we don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time, and we don't all know some form of martial arts. we're a people, and i'd appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature.

wendy wu: homecoming warrior has a very good, strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie. i am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much. i thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem entertaining to younger children. the matrix moves ruined the action, you know that it was absolutely fake. then there was the yen lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win. it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. so wendy learns a lesson...blah, blah, blah. i'm ready for the next dcom.

wow. this was probably the worst dcom ever. i watched the first half hour and i laughed. brenda song plays wendy, the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen. she is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts. shin teaches her the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world.this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible.brenda song is a comedic actress and i can't see her playing a serious role. it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin. shin couldn't act at all, and everything was totally unbelievable.i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing i came up with was the power rangers. this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger-esquire that it was just corny and stupid. the characters weren't likable and i just couldn't stand to watch it. disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel, along with other movies like jumping ship, color of friendship, go figure, read it and weep, & stuck in the suburbs.if you like action-adventure and corny jokes, you'll like this movie.

i'm here again in your local shopping mall (of course, 'cause that's where the high school kids hang out!!!!!) to demonstrate how awful "bendy poo: prom courier" really is!!!!! to prove how bad this joke of a dcom this is......we're going to take these four sumo wrestlers, and stuff them into this photo booth. how...cozy!!!!! hai! huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! uh!!!!! how awful is it????? it's so bad, disney channel flushes away its money, yet again, with those exciting yet determining 10-second promos, keeping the viewers wondering, "when is this going to be on?????" and then, suddenly, when it does come on, for one, this not only got a higher tv rating than usual, but this was only seen once!!!!! oh, no!!!!! one time everyone!!!!! plus, this movie is about high school and stuff, and believe me, i will not go any further with what else is in there.....say ch...smile!!!!! (snap!) avoid this one at all costs. 0/10

worst dcom i have seen. ever. well, maybe not as bad as smart house. this was just bad. the acting and story was fine, but the effects sucked!they were so fake! the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen. that was probably the only scene in which i was excited.overall, i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly. i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.4/10

there isn't more i can say that saying this film was awful. the whole chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell. but telling the audience that every chinese knows chinese history without even studying it just laughable. that is like saying every american knows american history without studying or every filipino, etc, etc. it just isn't believable.the story is flat out hideous. it talked about shin being from a monastery in china - later identifying it from bejing. however, the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on mongolia. i know the current chinese regime wants to claim areas like mongolia for its own, granted. but its a distinct nation and it even labels "mongolia" on the map. did disney studios fail 5th grade geography? the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him. her training is just cheesy as well. and, lets cut to the chase: everything about this film is bad. its bad enough to laugh at and cry over. the taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.the evil eyes thing was cheesy. however, the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it. they should have left the evil eyes ending in it. but instead somehow evil is defeated. yey! overall,not worth the time of the dog in the film. brenda song should get on with another studio. "f"

there are several things wrong with this movie- brenda song's character being one of them. i do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- i honestly don't. i believe she is given poor lines. she is just supposed to be, "that vain, rich girl", and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in, it can't even get a dry laugh from me here.either way, i really should have known what to expect when i sat down to watch this film.the movie was not that terrible...initially. wendy's reaction to shen was completely natural. i mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight "the great evil" and save the world? which brings me to another point. i know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in chinese culture. it seems like all of the "warriors" in wendy's family line were women. correct me if i'm wrong, but i doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that. sure, maybe they could've worked it in somehow, but they offered no explanation whatsoever. by doing so, they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by hollywood and the media.nevermind that, however- let us continue.wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on. yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming- i mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? the problem is, when "the evil" starts to manifest himself, wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be. she is extremely careless- even for someone like her. she continues not to care about her training. i will use this conversation as an example, shen: "if you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone." wendy: "whoa, talk about pressure. well...let's talk about something else." yes, let's wendy. let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training. of course shen lets her, but his character has an excuse. better that he cooperate with her, than that he not, and she not train at all, and get them both killed.oh, speaking of which. shen also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (i am assuming that part).this makes wendy's actions more unforgivable.as the script-writer would have it, wendy's homecoming and this "great battle" are on exactly the same day. do you know what wendy does? do you even have to guess? yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, (who shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she "felt weird fighting an old man") inform her that shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.we initially see some half-decent fighting, that is actually entertaining. until finally, the great evil comes out of wendy's rival-for-homecoming's body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.don't ask.anyway, wendy gets all "panicky." then shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.wendy catches shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.she screams title of said article out.now...it was bad enough that wendy became powerful far, far too fast. no, i will not let it be excused because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power within" her.since when, though, did she learn healing? no, worst...since when could she resurrect people? so shen is raised from the dead. then, wendy and he fight the guy.he loses way to easily. the worst part, is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. then the monks commend wendy on her sacrifice.two things, #1: don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more "finesse" to it? #2: what sacrifice? the fact that she didn't go to homecoming? because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleed. i mean, come on now, this movie was tv pg, i wanted to see somebody get hurt.ah-hem...moving on.i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one, based on my comments. part of critique, you must know, though, is breaking a thing down. you don't necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's there, you bring attention to it. this movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.so, i suppose it was all right. not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching it.

i thought this movie was terrible. i'm chinese, so i thought everything was totally wrong. many of the facts were incorrect. the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded shihuangdi. i also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. many of the actors and actresses were not very great. some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. i think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get. disney has really got to get more information about chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. mulan was quite accurate. watch this movie if you want to waste some time.

i thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. the elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. i'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:first, when shen told wendy that he would help her study the history of china, i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show wendy actually studying chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it. the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the autumn festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. they could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the moon lady. the myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the divine archer, hou yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the hou yi shot the eight out of nine suns). because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, chang-o stole it. after stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. she then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, i, most of the time, heard about this version). i thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally chinese oriented.the last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the terra-cotta warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese. the terra-cotta warrors serves as a connection of china's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. it would be understandable if wendy, considering she is chinese-american and doesn't have full chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.the whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and shen want to do is fight... i mean, it's rated tvpg due to violence, which goes against the confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.all in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, i would give it credit (2 stars) for removing one stereotype of asians and asian-americans of being smart and quiet.

this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous. if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which i might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to. the casting in this movie wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all. on a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4. brenda song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. when she made some of her "fighting" poses, i started laughing out loud. i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, i think that was incredibly stupid, and how wendy's (brenda song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to. so to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under.

i'd give it a 2/10.i was really, really disappointed.the storyline was poorly developed, for instance, the incidents were too short and brief, hence the moral was not clearly brought out. i thought brenda song did a fine job, but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role. i could see the need to put in western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts, where chinese elements were needed too! the villain for example. his physical appearance resembled a robot, instead of something out of the chinese culture. the final and the worst flaw, were the incorrect, and distorted facts placed in the show.others may point out that this is a 'kid's show' and hence, there is no need for the such high standards. however, there are other disney shows, such as mu lan, which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.in conclusion, i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned. a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on.

first of all when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu, i was definitely excited. brenda song, one of the hottest girls on disney channel, would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that... until i saw the movie. the action was poorly constructed, the movie couldn't have realated to anyone, the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked... along with the plot. if you really think about it's a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen, the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil. the idea just wasn't all that original, the movie is waste of time.

this reworking of anthony shaffer's classic play did not last long in cinemas. having recently suffered through it on cable, i still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. director kenneth branagh, writer harold pinter, and star/producer jude law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original.michael caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film. he now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead, played in that version by laurence olivier. (both were nominated for best actor oscars, but lost to marlon brando in the godfather.) looking puffy and washed-out, caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as batman's butler. he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter. what's next -- alfie ii, or son of the man who would be king? but then, no one benefits from this inane adaptation by pinter, who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of shaffer's witty character interplay. branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a second-rate nightclub. neither the shadows nor the tight, overacted close-ups can help law overcome his dull screen persona. the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller, almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.fans of the original stage production (with anthony quayle and keith baxter) and the olivier/caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream. the late mr shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as hitchcock's frenzy and several agatha christie adaptations, must be turning in his grave, wishing he could plan a real murder or two!

harold pinter rewrites anthony schaeffer's classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways. the original film starred laurence olivier and michael caine. caine has the olivier role in this version and he's paired with jude law. here the film is directed by kenneth branaugh.the acting is spectacular. both caine and law are gangbusters in their respective roles. i really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities. it's wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the script's direction goes haywire.harold pinter's dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and i understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play (which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like).the problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful. michale caine walks law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason. conversations happen repeatedly in different locations. i know pinter has done that in his plays, but in this case it becomes tedious. why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that law is sleeping with caine's wife? it would be okay if at some point law said enough we've done this, but he doesn't he acts as if each time is the first time. the script also doesn't move caine through his manipulation of law all that well. to begin with he's blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us.(never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered) in the original we never suspected what was up. here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why law's milo doesn't see he's being set up. there are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much.thinking about the film in retrospect i think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps. the opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between caine and law. missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller. instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesn't let them be real.despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work

i saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand. the plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing. the movie didn't have the "battle of wits" feel to me. the actors just spewed out mouthful's of nonsense, at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on. the plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end (i'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach), even the ending was predictable. and you could tell the detective was jude law in a costume, everything from the fake accent, terrible dental work, costume shop facial hair, everything pointed to it being a disguise. the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life. this movie had the feel of a puppet show with jude law and michael caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show, really boooring in my opinion.

if you're after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi, you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you've found you're movie.this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep. (type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs. fiction articles.) from a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit.i wonder how the director/co-writer agnès merlet defended her film at the time? perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim, which would've been unfortunate, because lets face it, she was.

dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result. violent sexy milligan at his most home made. little better than a home movie (as much of milligans films are) this is a trip into depravity 1960's style. notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint.(though decidedly r rated). the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production.(no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke). its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around.

sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail ("casino royale", "our man flint" are worse than almost any james bond movie). after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for some peace and quiet. (*1/2)

this was an incredibly stupid movie. it was possibly the worst movie i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. i cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6.............

imagine you're a high-school boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend. how bad would a movie have to be, in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended? this movie is that bad. really. movies often become so bad that they're good; this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness. it is painfully bad. horribly, terribly, crime-against-humanity bad.

this is a really dumb movie. it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't.some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween. they come to earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. these aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. other than the aliens, the acting is terrible. the writing is obviously meant for children, because every character is written like a kid.this is a dumb movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe.my rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. pg for mild language.

i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny. i saw it again last week, and you can guess the result. some funny parts in it, very few and too long. the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me.if you want a total b-movie this is a good pick, but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size

the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. in fact i am sure i will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, i will at least give it a go.firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. in fact the film might as well have been called 'toothbrush' or 'wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. at least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. i'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here.a more suitable title would have been, 'horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes.' yes that fits better.the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling, and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character....abysmal.the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off. bonus.otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one. no vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever, ever, ever watch this one again.no word of a lie, this film could put you off motion pictures for life.

i found it a real task to sit through this film. the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie. these conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together. it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking "so what" and "why did i waste my time watching this."

i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, did it turn corny, or should i say, "just plain stupid." this is just another example of outdated humor. it might have been funny in 1940, but not now....not even close.dick powell is always interesting to watch. i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it, too.he was fine as "jimmy macdonald," but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (raymond walburn) of the maxford house coffee company, who did nothing but shout all the time. he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie.

...but it's certainly not without merit. already writer-director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (no wonder the coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges.)the major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise, the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon, and the ending is thoroughly predictable. frank capra does this sort of thing much better.if you're new to preston sturges, check out "the lady eve" or "sullivan's travels" or "the miracle of morgan's creek" first. if you've seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one.

this one of the best celebrity's reality shows a ever saw. we can see the concerts we can see the life of britney, i love the five episodes. i was always being surprised by britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people don't watch the show at all we can how a great person she his. she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work. i just don't give a 10 because of k-fed he his a real jerk he doesn't seem to like britney at all. i they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how britney really is. go britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts.

the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. it's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.very little happens in this film. and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. but the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. it's a travesty. unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. the story in general is, to say the least, uneven. the women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious.the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.a few people have said that this movie is a giallo. i cannot agree less with this opinion. anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. it's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. but it's not very erotic either.i can't recommend this to anyone.

la sanguisuga conduce la danza, or the bloodsucker leads the dance as i believe is it's common english title, is set on 'ireland' in '1902' where the mysterious count richard marnack (giacomo rossi-stuart) invites soon-to-be out of work theatre actress evelyn (patrizia webley as patrizia de rossi) & three more of her fellow soon-to-be out of work actress friends cora (krista nell), penny (lidia olizzi) & rosalind (marzia damon as caterina chiani) to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast. at first evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand samuel (leo valeriano) goes along as well. once there count marnack tells his guests that his father & grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife & there's a feeling of unease when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current count's wife who ran away not too long ago... along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off...this italian production was written & directed by alfredo rizzo & is total, complete & utter crap from start to finish. first things first lets start the criticism with the title the bloodsucker leads the dance, lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there aren't any vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever, no-one 'leads' anything at anytime & there most certainly isn't any dance or dancing so don't expect any of these things. what you should expect though is a tedious, dull, boring pointless little 'giallo' that takes over an hour before anyone is killed & any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape, the first hour of la sanguisuga conduce la danza is as plot less & uninteresting as anything out there. the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft-core porn film you've ever seen, then cut most of the soft-core porn out & that just leaves bad actors, bad dubbing, bad dialogue, a tiny bit of soft-core sex & lesbianism & absolutely nothing else. yep, it really is that bad. the mystery elements are crap, people do illogical things for no apparent reason & the overly complicated 'twist' ending is as bad as the rest of it, the sixth sense (1999) this ain't!director rozzi does an ok job & la sanguisga conduce la danza actually has a nice look & feel to it despite it's obvious low budget, i mean there are scenes where he shows a 'storm' raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black & white! so the film jumps from bright colour to black & white whenever it cuts to the storm & back to colour again! there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid & her friend discuss her breasts & she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments, this scene is so funny & just so unnatural that it's priceless & easily the films best moment even if a bad 70's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue! there is minimal nudity & the sex/lesbian scenes are very tame. forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a decapitated head.technically the films pretty good, the period setting & production design are actually quite impressive although it's not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough. the film has a nice sense of colour & the cinematography is fine. the film is dubbed so it's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible & the dialogue is even worse than usual.la sanguisuga conduce la danza is a terrible film, it makes no sense, it has virtually no story for over an hour, it has possibly the most misleading title ever & is really dull & boring with a confused stupid 'twist' ending. as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't waste your time, as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid. trivia note: the notorious (& banned in the uk) nazi exploitation/horror film horrifying experiments of the s.s last days (1977) aka ss hell camp & the beast in heat was directed by luigi batzella & he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la sanguisuga conduce la danza.

this movie is not only a very bad movie, with awful actors --or presumed actors--, a bored direction and a story unattractive, it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent "giallio" "torso", directed by sergio martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world. in "la sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. naturally, the scene in rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino's film. to put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo's movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. i think that such things are an offense to spectator.

after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles, redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance. i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie.the story is simple. a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation. after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one. who is the killer? who knows? there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday.the pace is excruciating. the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either.give this one a miss.

a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot (if anything, the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot!), this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo (with a strong dose of erotica) only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout  actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful! here, we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a count  since he had become enamored of the leading lady, a dead-ringer for his missing spouse)! the characters are pretty much stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing hero (played by giacomo rossi-stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, sluttish companion (recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot!), a meek but devoted stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who, for once, gets in on the action, if you know what i mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star femi benussi though, for what it is worth, this is really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. while the film is not by any means unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, snail's pace, shoddy production (with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not help matters. besides, marcello giombini's score, though pleasant in itself, comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said, the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one (considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here).

wow-this one sucks. i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible. a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. a bunch of nothing happens for a long time. some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-the end.the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few brief nudie shots. and believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. in fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. as everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no bloodsucking, nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. it may as well have been called 'the goat-raper leads the circle-jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely...) so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious.  i can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10 

(aka: the bloodsucker leads the dance)lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in. the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me.gothic lesbians get invited to a count's island castle for the weekend. one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.it's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit. go figure...(sic)dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity. directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo, this is one snoozer.pretty boring 2 out of 10

in contrast to my fellow reviewers, i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see.yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping.something must be lost in the translation of the word "bloodsucker" from the italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so tacked it onto the film anyway.this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film!now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - italian softporn from the mid 1970s.i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli (credited most often as "krista nell").the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s.i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned.i think krista nell played "cora" but underneath that massive hair style, costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure.there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out.maybe something is lost in the dubbing process.what were the positive points?well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there.the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island.it purports to be set in "ireland" (north or the republic?)in 1902, so everyone sports period piece costumes.some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!anyway an enjoyable romp.i rated it 4/10.

the animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however, the story was too long, way too confusing, and over the top dramatic. after about an hour i couldn't wait to get it over with. with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies. if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it, but frankly, i've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell. go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice, you'll get way more out of it.

the last station, director michael hoffman's melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy, begins with fog and sleep. tolstoy (christopher plummer) lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana, taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his "movement", people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism, vegetarianism, sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away. his wife, sophia (helen mirren) wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov (paul giamatti), who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death. observing all of this is tolstoy's new steward, bulgakov (james mcavoy), a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife.hoffman's script, which is based on the novel by jay parini, quite often veers itself into confused territory, building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way. the scope of the film is grand, and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy, whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks' and those of pacifists like ghandi. it unfortunately doesn't, it's un-unpickable, building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness. the three-way relationship between the church, the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy, for example, is referenced often. in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up, but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy. there are a ton of details in the film, but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered, overburdened, energetic but unfortunately pointless.at its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy, and that story, as baffling and cramped as it is, is the reason to watch the film. mirren and plummer are, unsurprisingly, the best things in the film. plummer's tolstoy is vague, at once confused and resolute, apprehensive and full of joy and certainty. mirren's sophia is in full panic, in a righteous lather, forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time, his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas. they're great performances, all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple's place in history and the script's ability to support that, both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone, both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there. giammati and mcavoy, both talented actors, are unable to do the same and giamatti's chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief (and not both at once, either) but rather a cipher, a stand-in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses. the scope of this thing never boils down to anything, it hitches along, getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else. it's interesting and pretty, but ultimately unrewarding. 4.5/10

it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see "the medusa touch" should be warned about a scene that's eerily reminiscent of the sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in nyc. but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. despite an interesting pedigree (producer elliott kastner produced "harper" and "the long goodbye"; co-producer arnon milchan co-produced the oscar-nominated "l.a. confidential" and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for "gandhi") and an international cast, i found "the medusa touch" to be a heavy-handed, unintentional laugh riot. it was a poorly directed, horribly written and acted mess. it tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre. the movie fails on many counts. please consider "carrie" and the underrated "the fury" (both directed by brian depalma). they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter.

if 1977's "exorcist ii: the heretic" did him no favors, it's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills. you've seen it all before: burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind (and you thought "carrie" had no impact on hollywood!). though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway, "medusa" plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid (if typical). lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak. burton is hammy but weary...not even telekinesis could save him at this point. *1/2 from ****

what a great actor to have in such an awful story...the film and its production, however, is quite good, even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol. no matter  see one cathedral, you've seen 'em all, sort of.the story however...is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything, should he so wish. with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis, the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy, a teenager and finally as a man; so much so, in fact, that he exacts vengeance at will, literally. over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it!the trouble with the narrative, however, is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi-religious claptrap to produce a hodge-podge theory about it all. mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and i'm afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing. his very best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home: sharp, witty and deadly dialog, delivered as only burton could.a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better, though, beginning with lino ventura, whom i last saw in garde a vu (1981), as inspector brunel; harry andrews as assistant commissioner; the much under-rated lee remick as dr zonfeld; derek jacobi as a publisher, towney, and a few other well known character actors.i liked the way the story was presented, as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar (richard burton), the writer with the killer disposition. up till that point, it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick. still, it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would-be murderer.then, they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes. if you want a clue about what that is, think samson and delilah (1949), from the illustrious cecil b. de mille, and how samson got the bad guys in the end. and, the very last scene is just plain stupid. why? because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar's rampaging could have been stopped, absolutely.shame, actually, because this could have been a lot better story and movie. i guess burton really needed the money.if you're burton fan, then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above. otherwise, don't bother.

early film directed by d.w. griffith; it features a gloriously happy king (arthur v. johnson) and his queen (marion leonard) - but, wait! when the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the palace's minstrel (henry b. walthall). when the king discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe-type revenge. it's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). the sets make "the sealed room" look very staged. the performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. *** the sealed room (9/2/09) d.w. griffith ~ arthur v. johnson, henry b. walthall, marion leonard

terminus paradis was exceptional, but "niki ardelean" comes too late. we already have enough of this and we want something new.big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time, not behind. why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country?we are just born not reincarnated, and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times. most people dont remember or dont want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit. this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi! maybe younger directors should make the move.

yes, he is! ...no, not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies. pintilie is the naked "emperor" - so to speak...it's big time for someone to state the truth. this impostor is a voyeur, a brat locked in an old man's body. his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever. it is 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies. and if he does this in front of the audience, he might eve get a hard-on! did you know that, on the set of "niki ardelean", he used to embarrass poor coca bloss, by telling her: "oh, coca, how i wanna f*** you!"? she is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction! and, as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences, so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all?

this guy has no idea of cinema. okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. this all is very good, but look carefully: he does not know his job! the scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. he has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language. how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art? why don't they let him succumb in piece?

it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the "garcea" series or the "vacanta mare" child-plays... the difference is that mugur mihäescu, doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as "art". pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie ("duminicä la ora sase") followed by another one, nice enough ("reconstituirea"), tries to declare his film-lenghts "art works" - but, unfortunately, he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression. as such, "niki ardelean" offers again a sample of "how not" - this being about its only merit.

this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany.i find "the wooden horse" disappointingly boring. the subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but "the wooden horse" is told in a very plain way. it's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. the latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! i am disappointed by "the wooden horse", it wasted the potential to be a great film.

whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration. if in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afro-americans in georgia, such as shown in this film, obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there. it is rather hypocritical, to say the least, if everyone adores halle berry, whoopie goldberg, beyoncé, noemi campbell, denzel washington, will smith, et. al., whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides.white grandmother suddenly gets black grand-daughter thrust upon her, only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater. the story is sweet, not lacking tragic overtones, and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films, though the final scene has you guessing............ will he? won't he.......?gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering, and louis gossett is a good match for her; the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the show.a `nice' way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much, though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it.

my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos (battle for space) shown on russia's first channel on april 10-13, 2006. bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it's the case. the number of factual errors is such that it's impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). even the u.s. half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. the audience is not told of any v-2/a-4 launches from the u.s. three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number 'ue' onboard. apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon, etc. in the russian half, each and every person is ludicrous. korolev is scared of nkvd, glushko is saboteur and traitor, mishin is alcoholic etc. men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. uniform and decorations are awful. gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (i think this was added specially for russian version).

shocking!in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive. he was sincere, unpretentious and kindly, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person. in this movie i saw a clown! the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry. they made a cartoon! the real gagarin was someone else! don't believe in this movie!i saw this movie after the movies like "taming of fire" and "apollo 13" and after reading books "rockets and people" by chertok and "korolev: myths and facts" by golovanov. i was shocked by tiresome scenario, poor acting and producing, and a lots of inexactitudes of "space race".the movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in russia historical facts. a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated. some facts and details were perverted. for example, in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine, but in special prison design bureau. korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners. but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 (because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform). imho, the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies.

i've just visited russian forum of our tv-channel that had showed this film. well... 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed. we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film. but authors had in mind something else... :( we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here. we are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand. so i'd like to ask authors: where is our lunohod? and where, the hell our mir station? ah? i'm quite sure, that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrong's "walk on moon". and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes - i really have no time and enough space here! se our constructive critics in russian forum on www.1tv.ru

this movie sucked. the acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. examples:the heroine's negative comments about the hero. the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. no explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. it was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)

i sat through this movie this evening, forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two leads, gérard philippe and michèle morgan, were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in "something different," which this certainly was. they both gave fine performances, but of distasteful characters.indeed, the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is, of course, the major exception). what michèle morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained.this is supposedly based on a work by jean-paul sartre. all i could think was that, if sartre's work is anything like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus' masterful novel the plague, which dealt with a plague in north africa.a well-acted but uninteresting movie.

kurt russell (as steven post) works as a mail-boy for struggling tv station ubc (that's united broadcasting corporation); he is going nowhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like "abraham lincoln's doctor's dog" to studio executives - because lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. programming director joe flynn (as francis x. wilbanks) wisely rejects mr. russell's proposals, but has no idea how to pick a hit tv show. his secretary heather north (as jennifer scott), who does double duty as russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who bugs the heck out of russell when he wants to watch tv. turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily pick the hits. russell discovers the chimp's talent, and uses him to advance his own career. understandably, things gets hairy for russell and the cast!raffles the chimp (handled by frank lamping) performs well; raffles does look bored and/or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimp is supposed to look interested; these could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. a mild satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit tv shows! and, it's a monkey who gets a beer during the commercials (drinking in a disney film)! a look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun tv actors to recognize and try to place. you could make a drinking game, in honor of raffles' beer-guzzling, by guessing actors, and where you've seen them before. here's a start - hey, isn't that "dr. bellows" from "i dream of jeannie"? down the hatch! **** the barefoot executive (1971) robert butler ~ kurt russell, joe flynn, john ritter

i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad. until this. this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time. i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is. robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this 'classic'.

sometimes, making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to everyone's advantage. while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting, the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn't work. this film was so hideously slow and pointless, not even robin williams could save this garbage. it's obvious barry levinson's dream fell flat on its face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.

watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction--none.the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. so, how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! it's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career. the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school.the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. i really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment.

you get a gift. it is exquisitely wrapped. the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. it is a sight to behold.then you cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open up the box, and find...nothing. that's toys. you either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.the film isn't without its point and purpose: war is a not a good thing. well, isn't that original! the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. it's like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying "just kidding."but even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. but the images are cold and emotionally sterile. like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. the film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. robin williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his ad-lib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. for this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an oz far removed from kansas. every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.it is said that this was director barry levinson's pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. like most pet projects that finally get made (radioland murders, radio flyer & battlefield: earth being great examples) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage. he had already perfected it to death.many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy, mechanical, wind-up monstrosities. so is the film itself.

my life is about saving animals. i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life. i can't even kill a spider, i put it outdoors. the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies, with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. the ending - the foster parents adopt sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty. why would anyone want their child to see this film?

this film reminded me so much of "a history of violence" which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence. dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble. don't these men have a job? anyway, dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap. funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it.sam peckinpah who made the "wild bunch" which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared. but it was done with style, and you believed it. straw dogs is not believable. first of all the location is wrong and does not work. why place it in england? i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930's or something. second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife.sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one.

ridiculous fluff, that compounds its error by trying to have meaning. joan, this time as a congresswoman, agatha reed, chairwoman of a committee dedicated to "investigating the high cost of food." says congresswoman reed, "the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year, see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant." she's all business, but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college, where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night (the parallel to joan's real life is unmistakable here, as it is in all joan movies). the degree causes much consternation on campus ("that would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education!")  but joan is unaware of this as she arrives. the college president, jim merrill, played by robert young, at his handsomest, happens to be joan's former teacher  and lover. it was with *him* that she spent the night out, all those years ago, but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married. naturally, this high-profile event will be covered by *life* magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be? yet another of joan's old lovers  this one, she hung out with in china "during the war", and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame. eve arden, playing joan's assistant, "woodie," is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job, if you didn't like her so much. but you not only like eve in this, as in all her roles, you adore her. she is so droll and no-nonsense, you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys. when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater, eve tells her it "looks fierce." but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings, she, joan, sees youth  herself at 18 "eager, expectant  a little frightened, asking 'what is life? what am i?'" but, of course, if we actually go into depth about joan at 18, the truth may be a little different. for me, this is the major problem in watching any joan movie. you can call her characters whatever you want to, but it's always all joan, all the time. so, since what we're always seeing is joan being herself, it's easy to dispense with character's names. it's just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue, like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18, joan had already been around the block several times. many men would have described her as eager, and as far as being expectant, she had already had several abortions at this point. but that's a personal problem, and i digress, but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as "and then joan does" this or that, or "we see joan as..." when we are not literally watching a home movie.there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks. it fails. what also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness. in the story, joan has written a book about free speech and made a film (no, not the one about the plumber), and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical, dr. pitt, who is about to be fired for his views, which are shockingly similar to joan's. this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one, to be sure, but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion.

this series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing: made ian mcshane code name: diamond head instead of code name: tree. diamond head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue, which mcshane proved he could do with the lovejoy series. roy thinnes, the actual diamond head, is really only so-so in the role. mcshane is not really that good as the bad guy tree. france nuyen's character, tso-tsing, can't seem to make up her mind as to whether she's the hapless victim or the tough-and-ready-to-fight woman. she really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of diamond head's lover. after viewing an episode or two, i ended up not caring what happened to anyone. tree gives us a lot to hate him, but diamond head gives us nothing to like him. unfortunately, the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960's.

think of this pilot as "hawaii five-o lite". it's set in hawaii, it's an action/adventure crime drama, lots of scenes feature boats and palm trees and polyester fabrics and garish shirts...it even stars the character actor "zulu" in a supporting role. oh, there are some minor differences - roy thinnes is supposed to be some front-line undercover agent, and the supporting cast is much smaller (and less interesting), but basically the atmosphere is still the same. problem is, "hawaii five-o" (another qm product) already existed at the time and had run for years. it filled the market demand for hawaii-based crime dramas quite adequately. code name: diamond head may have been intended as the hier to h50 as the older series eventually dwindled away...but it comes across as a superfluous, 2nd rate copy. it doesn't suck, but it's completely derivative and doesn't do anything as well as the original.there is some decent acting talent involved here. thinnes is an old pro, and he gives the role his best shot, and he isn't bad. but thinnes is only as good as his material and his director. ian mcshane is in here as an evil spy master named "tree", and mcshane tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in. but he's phoning his part in here. frances ngyuen is reasonably exotic looking, but her astounding skinniness, opaque features, thick accent and wooden delivery aren't the stuff of which dreams are made. relying on her to supply the 'romantic interest' for thinnes was probably the series' biggest mistake. at least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with marsha brady and peggy lee as our love goddesses. give her another 30 lbs and a year with a dialog/voice coach, and she might cut it. zulu is, well, his usual self - enjoyable in bit parts, but he isn't a person who can carry a feature by himself. in addition, the plot and dialog are strictly by-the-numbers, with nothing to distinguish them from any other quinn martin production. and by this point, the american tv audience had seen a whoooole lot of qm productions....i think "cn: dh" was one too many, and it sank without a trace. it wasn't the really the actors' fault, and i hope they walked away from this with a decent paycheck and one more entry on their c.v.s. mst3000 revived this for their treatment in their sixth season, and they had a lot of good natured fun with it. worth seeking out in that version if you enjoy the mst approach to movie japery and lampoon, but i can't imagine anyone caring about this pilot for any other reason.

ahh, the dull t.v. shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t.v. movies! some examples would be riding with death(the most hysterically cheesy of the lot), stranded in space(confusing and uninteresting), san francisco international(horribly dull and unbelievably confusing), and this turgid bit of quinn martin glamor. shot in hawaii(although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots), it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. the real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters, including the drab main character diamond head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss 'aunt mary', who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; diamnd head's girlfriend/fellow agent(hell, i can't even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick zulu(again, i can't remember his character's name)who wasn't bad in small doses. the most interesting person in the whole production was ian mcshane, who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops. alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable. i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator cum american general. nor do i care. the plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on. just call this one - hawaii five no!

it doesn't take long to see why code name: diamond head didn't make it onto the network schedules. the tv pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be. maybe i missed something, because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. based on what i got out of the muddled mess, a terrorist or thief or something named "tree" (ian mcshane) goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. the world's dullest secret agent, johnny paul (roy thinnes), is out to stop him. there might have been more, but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway.action movies should have action. suspenseful moments should have suspense. and dramatic moments should have drama. there's none of that in code name: diamond head. i've seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this made for tv snoozer  and it's better than any one word description i can come up with. none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about. and roy thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable. his charisma is just slightly north of a slug. ian mcshane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member. now if mcshane had been cast in the series lead, well then you might have had something.i'm quickly discovering that these gawd awful 70s made-for-tv movies make great mystery science theater 3000 episodes. and that goes double if quinn martin was involved. very funny stuff from mike and the bots. so while i may only give the movie a 3/10, i rate episode #608 a 4/5 on my mst3k rating scale.

another turgid action/adventure flick from the quinn martin productions factory. roy thinnes plays undercover agent diamond head (mr. head, to you), working for his g-man handler "aunt mary", looking for "tree", who's on a mission to...well, just watch the movie. this one deserved and got the full mst3k sendup. as the boys and various reviewers have pointed out, the movie "fargo" had more hawaiian locations than this film. apparently shot on a puny budget, this movie highlights hawaii's broken-down dive shops, gas stations, and cheapo hotels. zulu -- later to star as kono in hawaii-five-o -- appears as thinnes' lumpy, inept sidekick, while france nguyen models the jenny craig diet gone horribly wrong. others sharing the flickering screen include a drunken richard harris knockoff, a george takai imitator, a not-so-smart hit-man with sprayed-on sansabelt slacks, and the villain "tree", sporting a veddy british accent. you can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits, but relax--just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70's movie-of-the-week.whenever i think of this movie (and i think of this movie often), i catch myself humming the theme, written for flute and tuba...no one knows why. trivia note--diamond head was directed by jeannot szwarc, one of three contract directors at universal who would go on to make much bigger films, in his case jaws 2. the others were john badham (war games), and a young fellow named steven spielberg...

don't get me wrong , i want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. i shall digress now. the writing, though, was unrealistic. a pta mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person. give me a break. the smugness of very pretty mary louise parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. the characters were not at all likable. basically, the plot lines went nowhere. i understand its only tv land . the hypocrisy was blatant. mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this.... why ???? i just got the feeling i was being preached by a show reeking of seediness. its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status. ok not exactly the same thing , but i think you people get my point. that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails , i guess, but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom , as the local pot dealer.

i had heard (and read) so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series (like entourage, sopranos or mad men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one. (didn't make it past the first six episodes) the writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing. the dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laugh.the characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. i absolutely hated the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator) and the removal of the hodes' daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and cliché, i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer's loyalty.episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.add to that i heard that season two wasn't as good, so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.if you're a fan of good casting and writing, i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you're stoned and then all bets are off.

though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series, bulldog drummond escapes, this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of ray milland.that said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. also john barrymore is present, popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises.anyway it's another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining.

weaker entry in the bulldog drummond series, with john howard in the role. usual funny banter and antics, but not much plot. barrymore gets something to do as the inspector, swapping disguises to follow drummond, algy, and tenny on a wild goose chase (mostly in circles; perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to rescue poor phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure drummond to his doom. for those keeping score, in this one, drummond is planning to ask phyllis to marry him and algy is worried about missing the baby's christening. it's fun to see algy and tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at the angler's rest, but little of it rises above silly.

this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but i really can't recall when i've seen a worse one. i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation. what it really was is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. they overplayed the 'conflict' card to the extreme. the first hour or so seems like a shouting match, with some implausible scenes thrown in.*possible spoiler*the 40-or-so minute 'memorial' scene (with requisite black umbrellas and rain) to fictitious crash victims was lame, and i thought it would never end. avoid this one at all costs, unless you revel in 'conflict'.

in the first 20 minutes, every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director. there was the ntsb primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically-tortured ntsb board member played by [i can kill any tv] ted mcginley; the tortured father of a crash victim; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer.hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft. the crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap. the first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in iowa after it lost its hydraulics. most of this tv plane wasn't even burned.it reminded me of the scene in "air force one" where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it's made of inch-thick steel.the show was so bad it was impossible to watch. even my wife, who is more accepting than i, was commenting on technical flaws. what had me stunned was how this pos could ever get made. are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them? somebody read this script and said: yes, i want to spend a million bucks making this real. i wish i was the guy's next appointment. i have title to a wonderful bridge in new york that i'd sell cheap.

this movie is very very very poor. i have seen better movies. there was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair. it begins slowly with the building of tension. which is not a success. at least if you ask me. though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down.they should had made it something like scary movie, then it might be a better movie. because i watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie. i must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so i sure can say it is not worth it.don't waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is. somewhere very dusty..

the story is seen before, but that does'n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard. it is clear that the director haven't spent his work on the storyboard. alongside this, the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie. the funniest is, however, if you take a look at the movie's website, you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles. because it remind us about hunting. but i have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) it will have 1 stars because the story is ok. it is a pity that ti west, has not spent more time to review his story. it is as if the movie was more important than the planning. because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away... come. everyone can make a movie, but not all will be just as good. so a word of advice to ti west are: stop and labeling what you want. use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard. you certainly have the ability and desire - so don't abuse your talent.

susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt. i'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers. i'm not one of them.i've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens. the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there. she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn.young mr. rijn contributes the worst performance in the film, in fact one of the worst acting jobs i've seen in a long time. no wonder he's not gone anywhere.i will say that seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot. but her work with her live performers didn't measure up. i'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with.look fast and you'll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler.if you like punk rock, you might sit through this for the soundtrack. i'll stick to bing crosby.

as a true elvis fan, this movie is a total embarrasment and the script is a disaster. the movie opens with the beautiful son "stay away" and the scenery of the grand canyon gives the viewer hope of something special. elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time, especially on the rest of the featured songs. i sat through this movie twice, just to make sure it is a piece of junk!!! 1 out of 10!!!

some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made. well, they are only partly right. for me, this is the worst movie ever made period! i have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry, this isn't even so bad, its good. there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis' other bad movies like clambake. this one is so rotten to sit through its painful. pure garbage. native americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here. actually, perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. grade: f

without question, the worst elvis film ever made. the movie portrays all indians as drunk, stupid, and lazy. watch elvis's skin change color throughout the film.

ok, the portrayal of the stereotyped 'indians' in this story is just plain wrong. i do agree that elvis looks rather good here, but yeah, his skin color does seem to change during the movie. i was thinking, ok,...he was never that tan in real life. it's some of the most obvious brown 'indian' makeup that i have ever seen. it's as bad as the 'indians' on 'f-troop' and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans!this movie is o.k., but typically lame story and mediocre songs, like in all of elvis' later films. he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible! i keep thinking 'thank god' that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. it is cool to see character actors joan blondell, katy jurado, l.q. jones, henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie, though.burgess meredith's 'indian' makeup is absolutely awful. it's the worst of the bunch for sure. what were the filmmakers thinking? was mr. meredith doing this one just for the money or what? i do love certain elvis movies, though. for example: 'love me tender', 'jailhouse rock', 'viva las vegas'. i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co-stars mary tyler moore and ed asner,'change of habit' in which elvis plays an inner-city doctor.oh well, at least elvis made a few good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.i'll always love elvis! thank you, thank you very much!

a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy. elvis presley plays an indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud). what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills, though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary isn't exactly pointed, but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest. as for elvis, he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point. this shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it, and though spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. *1/2 from ****

after a few lean years, 1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis: not only did he make that celebrated "comeback" tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  speedway and live a little, love a little. therefore, personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away, joe which, at best, emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering. sure, burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing  as, respectively, a dopey indian father to elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr. presley too - but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado (as meredith's mexican wife), the two jones  henry and l.q. - and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day! while there is a surprising (if not unwelcome given their usual blandness) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs! as can be expected, the typically 'western' arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy, snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point. on the other hand, the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here...

inventor wayne szalinsky (rick moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking/expanding machine to the smithsonian institution as he and his wife diane (eve gordon) get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam (bug hall). wayne's brother gordon (stuart pankin), his wife patty (robin bartlett), and his kids jenny (allison mack) and mitch (jake richardson) volunteer to look after adam while his parents are away, but as luck would have it (and the title would lead you to expect), the grown-ups are accidentally zapped by wayne's shrinking ray. as the kids run amok, their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects, wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons, and other threats to them. this was bad, like most straight to video sequels are, honey, we shrunk ourselves was sort of laughable. i had to laugh at that movie "roach" stuart pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous, view at own risk!

this straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career. as is the disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man', when this kind of thing was done properly. shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.

yes, talk about bad sequels. rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining "honey i shrunk the kids". the concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. if you think this sounds interesting, think again. the movie is boring at best, right down an embarrassment at worst.first of all, the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet. the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis. the actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed... you name it. they try to make us believe this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say the least.second, the story is a rehash of the first one, with not one bit of originality. all the few jokes (and there's barely any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from "honey i shrunk the kids".third problem, the special effects. i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series. you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time.fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is just boring. only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all. the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the bugs that live in it. in this one, the adults (which come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. disgusting.i don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disney's executives, except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. i'm warning you: leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay: getting dust on the shop's shelves.

if you liked the first two films, then i'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one. this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video, probably tv made sequel. the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski (rick moranis) is still living with his family and he has his own company, szalinski inc. unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too. now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger. pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things, e.g. a toy car roller coaster, swimming in dip, etc. pretty poor!

the honey, i shrunk the kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. i loved honey, i shrunk the kids when i was little. it was an original story and had such an exciting plot! the sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. now honey, i blew up the kid was pretty stupid, so i think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved.basically, adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. but when wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. but when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son, they get caught in the machine as well, leaving the kids in the house alone!the plot is silly, but like i said, it was just a family film that i think some might get a kick out of. the original honey, i shrunk the kids is the best, i think everyone could agree. the third one wasn't so bad, i would recommend this one at least over honey, i blew up the kid movie, it was at least a little more fun.4/10

i had the "privilege" of attending a special screening of 'the absence of light' at a horror convention in ohio.first off, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film, saying: "now keep in mind, we didn't have much money..." not that no-budget films are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always poor. and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-fest. actually, 'absence of light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema: it's the only time i've seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me. charismatic actors like david hess, tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no-names. who are their characters? what are they talking about? who cares? it's all so dull, you'll cease to care about anything or anyone.after thirty minutes of this endurance test, i gave up and walked out of the theater. not surprisingly, so did most of the cast members in attendance. any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this. with a little luck, this movie won't ever see the "light" of day.

absence of a good plot, absence of decent acting, absence of good cinematography, absence of decent looking special effects...need i go on? review may contain spoilers. the actors appear to be reading their lines, and not very well at that. most of the "actors" were acting like they were in a second grade play. the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders...it's not really all that convoluted...it's just so simple and dumb, that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. nope it's not, it's exactly as simple as you think it is. i understood the "film", that's how i know that it stunk! most of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines), trying to look sinister. the narrator was annoying. the "special effects" were laughable. i love low budget movies. i also like carolyn munro, tom savini, jack scarry, and michael berrymore...just not in this movie...you can tell they weren't getting paid, or weren't getting paid much, because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it. i love tony todd...however, he was only adequate in this movie. in fact, tony todd's performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1...and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes (seriously)! i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment. if i had gone to the theater, and paid more than a dollar to see this "film" i would have been p.o.'d and demanded my money back. hopefully the people who made this will do better next time.

now i don't hate cheap movies. i just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder. if i rent a movie, i want it to be a movie, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv - tapes.maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't. maybe i hate it because it's cheap, has the dumbest plot ever, the most unrealistic characters ever and the really, really, really worst showdown in the history of films ever. even tom savini can't save this.seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.

i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad. it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no porn.the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable. at the very least, the pacing should have been picked up.while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write it. many of the action scenes were just pointless.it was a complete waste of my time.

i don't know where to begin. this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. sort of like captain power or the power rangers. it's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding "secret agencies" and villains.the acting is so bad that it's not even funny. the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. for some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as being "remote detonated" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. this chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. standing up on the bikes, doing wheelies and so on. at one point, a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. then, a few seconds later the rider and bike return...apparently unscathed by the crash. at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up her car. which was also clearly done with cgi. sound confusing? it is, and so is the rest of the movie.i might point out that when i say cgi, we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here. we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi, actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers.why savini and todd did this movie i will never know, i can only assume they did for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it...probably the last one.

it's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts. well, i don't know anyone involved, and i've seen the final cut, and it is pure garbage. the only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends (none on screen for terribly long). it's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like tony todd, tom savini, david hess and michael berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks. this is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe x-files with terrible acting from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. there is little or no action; it's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot. ther computer fx are a joke, but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way. after about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button...and not letting go. absolutely worthless.

in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems, where the geneva convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded, a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate. however, if you want to see a film about that, try ed zwick's flawed the siege instead, because nada is one of the most infantile 'political' thrillers ever made. like robert altman's pret-a-porter, the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of, and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame.his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes - fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine's 'spy vs. spy' strip, michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell, mariangela melato a cardboard middle-class revolutionary wannabe - who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught. the corrupt authorities fare a little better, but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes.it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people (cf election), but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they're intellectuals who are talking down to the masses. in truth, were one to recast testi, duchaussoy and melato with jim varney, johnny knoxville and shannon tweed, the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film, not lower it.chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously, but his staging is so inept (the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself) and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch (special mention must be made here of duchaussoy: so very good in chabrol's que la bete muere, he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it's back again).chabrol has made some fine films, but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess - a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this, which would be a great shame. utter drivel, and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material. one star out of ten - and that's being very generous.

"nada" was the most inadequate follow-up to "les noces rouges" which,with hindsight,appears now as the last good movie of chabrol's golden era (1967-1973) "nada" is chabrol's first real attempt at a wholly political movie;its previous work "les noces rouges" had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french provinces."nada" includes terrorists,ambassador,hostage-taking,a lot of blood,not really chabrol's field.a heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce :only duchaussoy,who had already played with the director ,and maurice garrel are up to scratch.viviane romance ,one of duvivier's actresses ("la belle equipe" "panique") ,is wasted as a madam (gabrielle).italian actors (fabio testi,lou castel)are awful.with "nada" this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol .it would be "violette nozières" before he was again at the top of his game.

saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated, hated, hated it! easily the most booooring movie i have ever seen in my life. don't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you. if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this! yes, leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss.

woman with wig, who "dyes" her hair in the middle of the film (=takes of wig) presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away:*** begin spoiler alert *** that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her. *** end of spoiler alert ***and what a spoiler that was: the title already gives it away, doesn't it? bad acting, bad script: waste of time oh yeah: in the end, she lives happily ever after....if you liked this movie, you'll really love "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death"....

i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script, bad acting except for janine turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings. if you have never seen this movie before don't even bother it's not worth it at all. the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner, did a good job acting. terry's husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off. he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut. her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. nice girl huh. yeah she's a real peach, not. she's no day at the beach either.

the complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. i am okay with these night time soaps, like grey's anatomy, or ugly betty, or west wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. however, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (taye diggs, tim daly, and chris lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like general hospital...or a female counterpart to baywatch. that was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.

"private practice" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written "grey's anatomy". the cast is fabulous. the premise might even work. but the writing is just terrible.the pre-pilot disguised as a grey's anatomy episode should have been my first warning. the plot was just blah. i thought maybe it was a fluke. so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodes.as i was watching the pilot, i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. there's supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. amazingly, this show had none of that.thinking it was a fluke, i just watched the second episode hoping for the best. and although marginally better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss tv.i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. not worth the effort imo, and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season. pass this one up folks.

i've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting, considering medical facts that can be learned. but this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters. everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. there doesn't seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all americans. indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome.then we are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. for instance, in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.and i think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro-lifers. addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. the general feeling was that if you opposed abortion, you're a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the us. two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets, in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. what's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in. the script could have been written by planned parenthood.all in all, this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole show.

i have seen every episode of this spin off. i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is grey's anatomy. thus i have continued to watch. i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor grey's anatomy. the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga. there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately pp is not so. i loved kate walsh's presence in ga. i'm afraid kate walsh's life in la is simply not interesting.

private practice is supposed to be a medical drama. so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. just by watching house, i "solved" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. boooring. seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap? house is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your "friend with benefits", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed "drama".and i won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite addison as we got to know her in grey's anatomy... on a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way addison ends up lusting after loser pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with mozart's requiem is a loser, phd or not) and derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle? apart from that little fling with mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. sometimes i think shonda rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one...

it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the mediocreland? "pp" reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flicks (picket fences, ally mcbeal, and now boston legal). the crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. and that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, "this could be me" sentiment. they are not funny either.the actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live. i'm a therapist, and let me tell you - amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference/counter-transference courses in stanford. somebody should give them a code of ethics to read (the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it). no therapists are that bad.women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death, we've all graduated "sex and the city". addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well. the only successful/palatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la, and the "voodoo dr" and his coping with widowhood.this concept might work with a whole new writing team.

råzone is an awful movie! it is so simple. it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. just like zappa did many years ago. but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors. leon are by many still the little girl in "krummernes jul", and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like "film folket"!all in all i think people should see råzone. not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!

this film was rather a disappointment. after the very slow, very intense (and quite gory) beginning the film begins to lose it. too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about. the characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts... like, the young cop has to do dig up a body. of course it's night and it rains and he has to do it alone... yawn! or the manifestation of the evil being "nazis" plus "genetic manipulation"... wow, that's really original. there are some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though reno and vincent cassel do what they can) that's definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)

four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy, reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist, who, both living in the big apple, develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site. this in itself is not so unusual, but what is, is their method of communication. foregoing the verbal, they take to writing notes and later communicating through video.the film is based upon the creator's (arin crumley & susan buice) own relationship, who besides writing and directing, take to acting as the lead characters as well. with elements of avant-garde, anti-plot, and docudrama, the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self-indulgence.as the movie wears on, a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality. focusing solely on inner conflict, or the woes of relationship, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original, nor poignant. this could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict, and a third act, to which there is none - just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere.what is even more aggravating is the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish. this would have been all fine and dandy, but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered.(on a side note, the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of the production.)but as always, watch the film and decide for yourself.

definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing over every neurosis. however, i can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30. another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. however, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. there are 2 points to remember here. first, beware of festival darlings. second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment. but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. in the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point.

i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts. the true test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review. most of us would agree--even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs--that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons. likewise, fem can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons, and i actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography. from start to finish, fem feels like a pieced together vlog. (heck, even myspace gets some pimping.) if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15--i don't--i'd go watch it. fem, while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. it's like watching the mundaneness of life, which i think most would agree is very naturally boring. and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it, their very postmodern film about making a film. cue my yawn.ultimately, i come away not caring the least bit about any of it. i'm shocked that i'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review, even. it's not that fem is downright bad, because it isn't; it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe--just maybe--something of interest is about to happen. it's rather that it's just downright...mediocre. i feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an oxymoron: passionate indifference.i hope the creators/"actors" in the film get out of debt from their efforts. they'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life.see this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do; otherwise, pass it by, and don't worry that you've missed some great, undiscovered talent. you really haven't.

all hype! what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor? consequently, they do it themselves. otherwise, the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film. the story is absent and could easily be a short. the acting is poor, but the animation and music is pretty good. otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! however, if you have the chance to see the film for free, do so. then you won't have to waste money. still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. otherwise, they're one hit wonders who never had a hit.

i don't know where to begin. the cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since. debralee scott is listed on cover boxes, but does not appear in the movie at all. the writing is quite bad, even for college films. it's obviously very low budget, with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing.the characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy, nerd, suave black guy, tough guys, guy with mustache, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. the featured teacher is about what's you'd expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.if you wan't to see a college flick, stay clear from this one. it's so bad, it's not even funny.

i think this is one of the weakest of the kenneth branagh shakespearian works. after such great efforts as much ado about nothing, etc. i thought this was poor. the cast was weaker (alicia silverstone, nivoli, mcelhone???) but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the bard's work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical/dance sequences.you just don't do shakespeare and then mess with the play. sorry, but that is just wrong. i love some cole porter just like the next person, but jeez, don't mess with the shakespeare. skip this and watch "prospero's books" if you want to see a brilliant shakespearean adaptation of the tempest.

this self-indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on mr. branagh's career as an adapter of shakespeare for the cinema. (released 4 years ago; not a peep of an adaptation since.) i just finished watching this on cable -- holy god, it's terrible.i agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill. that being said, i'll take the risk, if only because *love's labour's lost* is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr. branagh's directorial abilities in the past. branagh has always been a pretty lousy director: grindingly literal-minded; star-struck; unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors (he loves his american stars, but loves himself more, making damn sure that he gets all the good lines).along those lines, the sad fact remains that *love's labour's lost* is scarcely worse than the interminable, ghastly, bloated *hamlet* from 1996. in fact, this film may be preferable, if only because it's about 1/3 the length. branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeare's to the milieu of cole porter, george gershwin, fred astaire, yada yada. so he sets the thing in 1939, leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of thirties' standards (wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during "i'm in heaven"), and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing (himself included). the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didn't call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies. i don't even blame the cast. to paraphrase hamlet, "the screenplay's the thing!" no one could possibly come off well in this hodge-podge: the illustrious rsc alumni fare no better than alicia silverstone. who could possibly act in this thing?branagh's first mistake was in thinking that *love's labour's lost* was a play worth filming. trust me, it isn't. it's an anomaly in the bard's canon, written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers -- not the usual audience for which he wrote. hence, there's a lot of precious (and tedious!) word-play, references to contemporary scholastic nonsense, parodies of lyly's *euphues* . . . in other words, hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience. hell, it doesn't appeal to an audience already predisposed to shakespearean comedy. the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately "updating" it with any gimmick that comes to hand. which begs the question, why bother?branagh's second mistake was in thinking that shakespeare's cream-pie of a play could be served with a side-order of gershwin's marmalade. clearly the idea, or hope, was to make an unintelligible elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time. but again, this begs the question, why bother?

spoilers all too often, hollywood's shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema. beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text. films including branagh's "henry v" and 1993's "much ado about nothing" are powerful pieces of work. watching "love's labour's lost" therefore, it's such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste. sadly "love's labour's lost" is awful! the king of navarre (alessandro nivola) and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies. plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france (alicia silverstone) and her entourage arrive. soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the prince's mind.from the start, you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare. cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by ken branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste. classics like "the way you look tonight", "let's face the music and dance", "i'm in heaven" are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just don't belong here.aside from weak singing, we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars. ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film, but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles.the main eight actors (four men & four women) are all equally dire, and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy spall.in fact, only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that's the consistently magnificent nathan lane. lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester costard.there's little else to be said really. "love's labour's lost" deserves mild praise for branagh's original take on an old tale. unfortunately though, that's where the positives end. weakly acted, performed, sang and constructed, "love's labour's lost" is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years. it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made. a poor, disappointing choice by branagh and here's hoping his next effort is better.

this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story. two tabloid reporters, one seasoned(miguel ferrer)and one not so accomplished(julie entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer(michael h. moss) may actually be a vampire. stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally, but by way of a black cessna he seeks his victims. the gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale. keep in mind that mr. king had nothing to do with this film. i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night.

would have better strengthened considerably by making it as a50 minute episode of the outer limits. too much superfluous material and stuff like the chief bad guy looking like he'd escaped from the phantom of the opera didn't help. the whole 'night of the living dead' sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary. after all, if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins, now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again?

this film is so unbelievable; - the whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable. the vampire himself would not look out of place in a bela lugosi film. most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot. i await the day when someone makes a decent film from a steven king novel (with the exception, possibly, of stand by me). this film suffers from what most stephen king films do - lack of money used for the "special" effects, poor actors, appalling characterisation and dialogue. this film is cheap, tacky and fails in everything it tries to do.

i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less.scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism. in their lab(a run down warehouse in l.a.), they create a t-rex. a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase.of course the t-rex(a rubber puppet)gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast. it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off.one cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city. she is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio. she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost.the t-rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are blazing gun battles and buildings(cardboard mock-ups)blowing up, but a single police car, or the army, nor anyone else ever shows up. such activity must be commonplace in los angeles.we can only hope that a sequel isn't planned.

you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason? well, out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t-rex. knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t-rex from jurassic park, i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie.i was not disappointed in the least.mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives, and of course, a big, poorly animated, sock-puppet t-rex. is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies? not to mention the rex's hungry is never satisfied...ever. how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat (really if you look down his mouth when he roars, it's solid...like a toy or something). now, i like watching incredibly bad b-movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. this one was hilarious. i'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you will laugh. do i blame the movie's budget...yes, but the acting didn't help either. ok, tony todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles...when you cry shouldn't "tears" come out? meh, i am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what i recommend: watch this movie, then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back. you will be writing mr. spielberg thank you letters the next day.

i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed.acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.plot - being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable. i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.special effects - rotflmao!!!!! they were short bus special directing - until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this.it is good to know that your friends/family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie

my first opinions on this movie were of course bad.i was expecting a horrible, crappy acting, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects movie.what i got was actually not that bad.the special effects were absolutely horrible, but i found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent.the acting wasn't that bad, and overall i had fun watching this movie.it's still a pretty bad film, but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be, and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me, even when it wasn't that good.overall, it's a film that should be avoided, but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be.

if you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of the eden formula. this wondrous film must have cost all of $50 to make. it features a wafer thin script, pathetically bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion, paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable (it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful). the actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter. the special effects are way beyond lousy. and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'tyranasaurus wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes.this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath. i loved every minute of it.

this review is mostly all spoilers. if you plan on enjoying this film, don't read this review. that's the problem with kids tv nowadays. it's all so patronizing and condescending. `wow, that was fun, wasn't it?' no it wasn't. and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well. and that is what 'flight of the reindeer' is all about. admittedly i haven't seen 'flight of the reindeer' in a few years so i might be hazy on some points, but i remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time. essentially, the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for christmas. now, the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal. i think it was bullfrogs. anyway, through this book, mr lecturer / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs. apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the north pole. now, if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window. flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon, but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept. but, mr lecturer isn't me, so i guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he's gone. of course, things go awry and before he knows it, a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he's stranded at the north pole. are you still following this? good. his family, of course, are devastated. i would be too, i mean, what a suck-tacular christmas. elsewhere, mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. rather than try to escape immediately, as i would have done, he greets everyone there with open arms. this hidden civilization of midget monsters, and he greets them with open arms. oooo-kayyyy. they feed him this story that they are the elves of santa claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist. and mr lecturer accepts all this. he even accepts that santa claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. there's just one problem - they don't want him to leave. the world can't know of their secret existence. after all, before they'd know it there'd be a mcdonalds and a starbucks on every street corner. still with me?now, mr nice guy's family find the book and assume he's gone to the north pole. boy, wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he'd just gone for a brisk walk? before the audience knows it, they're jetting off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. meanwhile, mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave. i can't remember exactly, but i do recall him holding santa claus to gunpoint. a fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via santa's sleigh. with santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes, mr whatever, through some marvellous co-incidence, finds himself flying alongside his family's plane that is looking for him. so he jumps on to their plane, the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after. the fact is, there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it. and it's that charm that is utterly devoid from 'flight of the reindeer' there isn't much wrong with it; nothing which insults the intelligence (well, obviously there is, but it's a kids film and thus can get away with such things) or anything particularly offensive, but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either. it just doesn't feel christmassy. and for a film that is all about christmas, that it a pretty major flaw. but hey, i don't think 'flight of the reindeer's target audience mind about that? why should they? they're all so doped up on sedatives they probably couldn't spell `christmas' i give it three out of ten. if it was a tv-movie then i'd add another two stars onto it. we all know how bad they can get.

the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film, but i was truly disappointed. they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over, which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project. as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in, although beau bridges, as nick, did have a moment or two. if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume. it was an embarrassment. i had been a fan since his waltons days, but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offering.in defence of the actors, the directing was stilted, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish.i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film. however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back, even though it was on t.v.

this thing was bad. really bad. i mean, low budget can sometimes be very inspiring, but not this. the story was so off-the-shelf, the alien's behaviour so illogical, the characters so clichéed. i found nothing good in it. and i did try.

i'm a big fan of movies that make you think. i'm still thinking long and hard about this one, fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled. what's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body, made extra-tacky by being filmed on cheap video. this happens three times and i was certain it would be explained in the end. i put my trust in the film-makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified. it was not.the movie has to be the most apathetic i've come across in the genre. the sets look like a cross between a 1970s dr who set and someone's ill-formed idea of a sponge-painted living room. the lighting is unimaginative (if your sets are going to be that bad, at least film them in semi-darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance). of the abducted quartet, the girl stands out as being particularly lame, but none of them is given a personality. the aliens' plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved. most of the movie consists of people running down corridors. yes, it really is that exciting. the "ray gun" special effect is ... curious, to say the least (what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill, and even then the guy comes back for more?). the script is like a bad episode of the a-team, and the ladies' hairstyles come from the same era, so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders. when we finally get to see what the aliens really look like, they're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes. the resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who's never had an idea more complex than a saturday morning cartoon (i mean the bad ones with no plot, action, or characterization) in his or her life.but seriously, what is with the naked chick?! was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the dvd cover to boost sales?

pyare mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. the film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. vivek oberoi and fardeen khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. while black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, pyare mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. anu malik's music is fair enough. vivek oberoi who made a promising start with saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in hindi cinema. fardeen khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. amrita rao and esha deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. boman irani, as the villainous don toni, is somewhat acceptable. avoid the film if possible.

aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot, this movie wasn't too bad. unfortunately, that doesn't leave much movie not to suck. do not waste your time on this film, even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia, as i did. watch an infomercial instead.

too bad, i really like kristen cloke and gary busey. but the director failed to put this together. there's a lot of action, a lot of promise, but it all comes off hokey. the director didn't do his job. promising action comes off lame. so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. this version of "the rage" (directv credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. another director would have done a better job.

darkman 3: die darkman die is directed by bradford may, the same guy who made the first darkman sequel too. darkman 3 is worse than darkman 2, and is nothing special, in my opinion. larry drake is no more as a main villain, who is now played by great jeff fahey, whose character once again wants to get darkman's work and create this time some ultra strong humans in order to get the leadership of the whole city. the film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as darkman 2, but i was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from darkman 2. these sequels were made in short time and with little money, so these kind of decisions had to be made. couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exiting, but still this is pretty tired film and often irritatingly stupid, too. the characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying. there is no any philosophical depth in the film, and this is like a remake of darkman 2 which it still cannot equal. darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work, and larry drake's ability to play great villain. darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments, but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches. the few positive things in this movie are flashback edits (westlake's nightmares) and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks. and worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore. far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two. darkman 3 is worst in the whole series, and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they don't come even close to raimi's original darkman with liam neeson. darkman 2 was okay actioner with plenty of great scenes and suspense, but this last (?) entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel. it has some merits as mentioned, but overall feeling is that this should not been made in the first place. may is talented director so hopefully he can get some more noteworthy projects in the future.3/10

normally i'm quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films, but darkman iii is so appallingly unengaging that i feel nothing but contempt for it.it looks and feels like a tv show, and a particularly shoddy one at that. the sets are sparse, the lighting flat, the score and effects disjointed, and the camerawork is film school 101. there's no plot to speak of, the characters are one dimensional, and the actors are sleepwalking. most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn..... in fact, the only reward that i got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced roxann biggs-dawson (b'elanna from star trek: voyager) without her klingon bumpy head makeup on. her skin tone is about two shades lighter than it is in voyager; either she's been bleached down for this role, or blacked up for voyager. very strange either way.

if you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them, then this one is for you! but if you are somewhat normal, and don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this one up. this movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.with the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.i've seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (btk movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.we watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.if anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. as a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked.

i saw this film at its new york's high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore. although it was funny in some places, the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden, especially the "lovely lady" and the voice of the narrator (whom i have never heard of) had a lot to be desired. j.c.mac was, i felt, the redeeming feature of this film, true action and grit and (out of the cast) the only real acting. i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing, this could have been a half decent film. let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release, or if you really want a copy, look in the bargain bin in lidl.

this should be a great film... meryl streep and jack nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. mike nichols directing. uh uh. it's dull dull dull! pointless and predictable! slow and unfocused!it's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy' story. now theres an original concept! after squirming through two hours (was it only two? it felt like six.)i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. it was done in 1986. i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget. i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade. it's not that it's such a bad picture. it's just that it's such an un-good one.

the movie was watchable while nicolson was on the screen. however, i had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on meryl streep to carry scenes without jack; she was as bland as could be. the relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been portrayed before -- and much better. it felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring, and not worth writing about or watching. why ephron felt her life and relationship with carl bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me. perhaps she wrote it as therapy -- for many writers, putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic. fine: but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me.

you could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that statement wrong. most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to. they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways. the story is very simple. it could be summed up in a few words, but i'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film.i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. i'd have to say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. quite frankly, i'd rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth. personally, i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.outside of my own personal dementia, the film really lacked anything worth it's time. there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging. when something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry.best not to look this one up.

i just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. these other reviewers aren't joking around, this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. it really does. like the "director" took the family hi8 camcorder (before dv cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. no script, just making it up as he went along.when i watched it, it was on my mono tv, so i only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong. the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. they recorded the sound on different bloody channels! i mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. i'm not sure this is one of those. i mean, i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better, you know. but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.as bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. but alas, no. if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity. worked for roger corman.

i saw this movie a few days ago... what the hell was that?i like movies with brian o'halloran, they are funny and enjoyable. when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great, this one could be really good... some parody for slashers or another gore movies... but.. then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway... but it wasn't...my opinion: if like movies they look little bit like documentary, with little bit of comedy try some moore's movies or alien autopsy, they are really about something. this one was empty. and put a comedy to title... no comment... really bad joke

i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better. don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential. the premise is good, the cast is great (i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton) and, god love 'em, you can tell everyone tried their best. it just falls short over and over again. "brutal massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and, despite the fact he makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. naughton and brian o'halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often...they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me. if you're going to have the "spinal tap" of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made "spinal tap" to helm it...just thinking out loud there.

roman polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. his fame bewilders me. nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown (i haven't seen 'knife in the water' or 'tess'). any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (the pianist, frantic, oliver twist, the ninth gate, pirates).r's baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. it's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). but this is just misconceived horror sap. everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. it did not sustain my interest. i find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. there's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil.the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential.

lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires. as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together.great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film. yes its a sexy vampire story. no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women. to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great, but other than that...for those who want to see sexy vampires only.

another made for tv piece of junk! this is an insult of a war movie (i use the word movie in it's loosest possible form!) i thought telly savalas's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit birmingham video that's shown on tarrant on tv on a semi regular basis, but then i'd forgot he was involved in this! i'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but cable tv brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me!! i like the bit (laughs sarcastically!) in the film which claims to be a scene from liverpool in the forties, but it's blatantly a shot of zagreb cathedral in the late eighties. also the steam train the commando's are training on shows the jz (jugoslavia zeleznice, or yugoslav state railways) logo's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, even though the makers have tried to black them out. why not just film in the uk, if that's where most of the film is set? cheap rubbish, and a waste of celluloid!

it really was that bad. on a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived "dirty dozen" tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in yugoslavia).i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for telly savalas in particular. he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in "the green berets" pretty much sums it up.other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so i won't repeat them here. but i will add that i'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that savalas wears on his big, bloated head. i'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at imdb.as far as i'm concerned, it's a "1" right across the board. if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than "the dirty dozen - the fatal mission".awful - avoid!!!!

the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun. the good guys never die, unless its for dramatic purposes. the "plot" has so many holes its laughable. (where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train? erik estrada? please!) and the whole idea, hijacking a train? how moronic is that! the germans know where you are going to go, its not like you can leave the track and drive away! what a waste. i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again. i mean, seriously, it felt like it was made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88!! 1988!! the a-team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie. only watch it if you need a good laugh. this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne.

"lies" tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes. with very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama, "lies" quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam. with an almost 2 hour run, subtitles, and so little substance, "lies" is simply not recommendable. (c-)

i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york and was horrified by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography that i witnessed. the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes - and, not one is in the least bit erotic - sick is the more the feeling. the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this. see it if you can stomach it - i still have flashbacks.

i was at first disgusted with director sun-woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me. jang had the potential to create a strong, deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people, but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element. i couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best  yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it. what stayed with me wasn't the story, it wasn't the characters, nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film, but the transition that jang demonstrated between y and j. if you watch this film carefully, you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship, eager to jump into the unknown, but not quite certain the next step. as they continue to meet, exploring new avenues of pleasure, they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed. jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y. it is a very small change, and due to the graphic content of this film, it can easily be missed, but it is there. it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y, as their meetings become less frequent, and j attempts to become a part of normal society. this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes, but alas, it was the only element of this film worth viewing.i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic, because there are human elements at the core of this film, as underdeveloped as they are, they are there. it is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers. what happens behind closed doors is never known  or so we should believe. while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit, director jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery. our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh. this is fun at first, but again, jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting. this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film. jang had a great story with gojitmal, but where he failed (outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side) was that he took scenes, repeated them time and again, without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters. where was jang going with this movie? did he want the sex to tell the stories, or did he believe the characters would? he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves. the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two, absolute unknowns, of this film. i have to give jang some credit for trying, but not much. he attempted to create some sub-stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking, but they just couldn't congeal well together. y's brother and j's wife were those plot points, but again, due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element, these stronger sub-stories became un-rememberable and down-right dull. maybe it was just how i viewed this film, but outside of the sexual scenes, nothing else worked together. we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed.finally, i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us, the viewers, closer to the emotions being felt by j and y. from what i can remember, and i am trying to push this film far from my mind, i don't remember any musical undertones. gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings. while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself, there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more. technically, this was a poor film. obviously an independent film in nature, it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature. i didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above, i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough. this was no larry clark production; this was sub-par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release! overall, i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy, but i felt this film was rushed, repetitive, and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them. the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived. our characters were uneventful, our story was underdeveloped, and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex. to me, jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic  and it failed miserably. this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.grade: ** out of *****

this movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film-noir to it. it's basically one messy heap of different genres, of which none really works out like it was supposed to.this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor. he's a former child-star who always used to star in in happy comical- and musical productions at the start of his career. in this movie he picks a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the movie). but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie. i mean mickey rooney as a tough player? he's an extremely small boyish looking man. he actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old. hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right. he simply isn't convincing in his role.because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one. somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot-line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all. it just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch. lászló kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957. he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality.let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's. this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black & white. generally speaking black & white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception.it's a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence. it wasn't the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies, often simply as himself. i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie. the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song.an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney.4/10

i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good-looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket. after popping it into my dvd player i re-examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film. this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb.the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good ... then, a line-reading actor spoke. oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script. at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync, then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn't read the jacket... english dialog dubbed. if they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film might have been decent. i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off, but stay as the constant main fixture. yes, it is that bad! the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great, so gave the one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialog. i do not recommend this one!

as a horror-movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre, especially those which are the products of my native cinema. and i can say that that the "power of fear" (or "vedma" as the russian title of it) is one of the weakest film among them. firstly, it can't scary even a little kid, it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror. frankly speaking, it's bad in all points: from the goofy plot (i don't know why the russian producers/director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern-day-america thriller. i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it doesn't thrill a bit) and to the terrible and cheesy actors' work. all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn't even bother to play at all, only spoke their english lines without any expression. and at the end i don't really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors? i think it was their wrong turn. at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing. the same i can say about so called "small american town backgrounds" which were shot in estonia and look like it. the only positive moment i found in the "power of fear" is the visual effects. they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film. and the music is ok, at least it doesn't irritate me. that's why i give it two stars. overall, if you want to see good horror film  don't waste your time and money on this boring flick. and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i'd advise you to find a copy of "viy or the spirit of evil". it's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as "power of fear" but much, much better.

ivan (valeri nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. he travels to this small town where it's said that a witch (ita ever) is terrorizing the community.his car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the town is wondering who murdered this woman...who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure. ivan is now being pursued by her spirit, or something, and he has to have faith, or something, to beat it.i really hate christian films. they are usually filled with lame actors, stupid storyline and minimal effects. not to mention that this isn't just a christian film...but a foreign one as well. the voice-over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing, because it is so high pitched and whiny. you won't miss much by missing out on this film.

nikolai gogol's story "viy" has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films.the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him. greatly expanded and set in america, though clearly filmed in russia (the houses,clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs), this is an odd film that doesn't really work.part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't.there are also some weird, intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later. i'm not sure why they did that, even after watching the making of piece on the dvd) the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful. its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera- or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps. i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west (revealed in the making of piece).the film isn't very good. as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio. despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film. as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god.given the choice i'd give it a pass, even at a bargain bin price. my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god.

possibly very minor spoilersthis movie is billed as the first russian horror movie. unfortunately, as far as i am concerned, "the witch" (its russian title) will take a place of dishonor in the gallery of horrible russian movies. it is based on nikolai gogol's story "viy" which is a classic in russia. "based" is the key word here since no familiarity with the story is required. instead, the less you know about gogol, the better. it is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture. the spate of american remakes of foreign films is a prime example, but then again, sturgess turned kurosawa's seven samurai into the magnificent seven with splendid results, and kurosawa transferred shakespeare's macbeth into japan to make an incredibly powerful throne in blood, while king lear became a riveting ran. however, with "the witch," we have russians transplanting a russian classical tale onto the american soil. the movie was shot in estonia in english with the aim of dubbing it into english using american actors and have reasonably synchronous lip movements. as a natural consequence, lost is the colorful ukrainian background for the story, in comes a drab american small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book manual. gone is the boozy seminarian khoma brutus, instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win pullitzer prize, and who at the same time writes about x-files-like events and frequents miss boobs contests. (i never thought pullitzer prize was given for that kind of writing, now i humbly stand corrected.) in a strange nod to russianness, the journalist is named ivan berkhoff. they should've named him john smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, clichéd and generic than this movie. berkhoff goes to a town named castleville, gets stranded on a dirt road, staggers on until he finds a dilapidated house and is rather un-welcomed by an old crone. all that to the accompaniment of a radio announcement about the forces of evil being at their most powerful, and people better staying indoors and avoiding water. need i mention that it's raining really hard? after a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing, the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest, he's mistaken for a priest, and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights. at this point, the action supposedly starts. those who have time to kill are welcome to it. what is wrong with this film? everything, starting with the dialog and down to the prop department. the dialog which i heard in russian was clearly originally written in english, and it was compiled exclusively from clichés and platitudes picked from american films. the actors just as clearly struggled with english because the timing of their speech was labored and unnatural, and the russian dubbing followed suit. the acting is mostly atrocious, and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they don't have anything approaching a range of facial expressions. for the most part, they're just blank or you wish they were. the only exceptions being the sheriff played by lembit ulfsak, a fine estonian actor, and arnis lizitis who plays a wheelchair bound resident of castleville. oh, and a rooster of course who's absolutely natural on camera! i know actors complain of being upstaged by dogs and cats but when nikolaev is upstaged by a rooster it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film.there wasn't a single scary moment in the entire film, and there wasn't a single original moment in the film either. mind you, this comment's coming from somebody who's rather inexperienced with horror. the film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the genre's inception. at a critical moment, the camera lingers lovingly on a kerosene lamp. the lamp promptly goes out. it must have seen a few horror movies, too. an example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment, a character jumps out of a bathtub and runs at the camera. he's wearing something the looks like loincloth! it doesn't get any more idiotic than this!those in russia who liked it claim it should've been advertised as a mystical thriller. i wasn't thrilled either. it was run-of-the-mill from start to finish. i particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town behaved as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie, except they weren't quite sure whether it had zombies or not. therefore, some of them acted zombie-like just in case. the makers of the film say it's about finding faith. such a fine collections of idiotic actions, stupidly contrived moments, and, yes, clichés, doesn't deserve to be about finding faith. the movie is so thoroughly and utterly fake it deserves only to be an exhibit in a wax figure museum.

what's in here ?! let me tell you. it's the presence of (alec baldwin). he's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them. he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after. so not to mention (literally !) the matter of (steve mcqueen) being at the same role in the original because i don't want to make that comparison in the first place. i'm not a big fan or even a fan of (kim basinger), she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average ! and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty !!?? well, if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i'll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible ! and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger's legs ??!! it's surely insanity or bad tasting ? as i don't see them both as not sexy only, but ugly too ! and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what ?! i've just watched this movie so i'm dead already !. yet, what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the mostand of course i mean (jennifer tilly)..now we're talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette (marilyn monroe) however much more healthier !! (i can't help it, she was the only new and watchable thing in here !). (michael madsen) as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys, (james woods) is here to summarize the early events beside the pool (so the trailer would be by his voice later !) and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywood's stuff so "do your thing, take your cash, and good luck as an actor in other movies !", the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography, so the main goods of it (the action, the thrill, ..) are here and fairly well-made, though any echo for deep meanings about (the kinds of betrayal) as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so don't wait for it. ok, it's all in all another remake without anything special (except jennifer tilly's spicy moments !) so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldn't end my review saying that (basinger) or anyone here did better than this movie.. it would be an insult because frankly.. anything is better than this movie!

any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake. alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work. while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. mcqueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said. mcqueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable as doc, the film had excitement and suspense,baldwin and company made this into a comedy,i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film. and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors! did the makeup people have it in for michael, what were they thinking.if you wish to see movie-making the way it was under sam peckinpah's direction get the original!

nowhere near the original. it's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story. but the directing is very poor. basinger is weak - without good directing. baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen. i watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of peckinpah's masterpiece, and i got what i thought. almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing. i wasn't even disappointed, i just don't know what they were trying to do. this remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.this is a complete waste of your time. save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again:)))

don't even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on it's own merits, but when compared to the 1972 original (which is a classic) it's down right awful. and btw, somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book. this is silly, movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. they are 2 completely different art forms (as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does). if you used this criteria for all movies then "2001" would suck and so would "forest gump" and "silence of the lambs".

back when alec baldwin and kim basinger were a mercurial, hot-tempered, high-powered hollywood couple they filmed this (nearly) scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 steve mcqueen-ali macgraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome. it almost worked the first time because mcqueen was such a vital presence on the screen--even stone silent and weary, you could sense his clock ticking, his cagey magnetism. baldwin is not in steve mcqueen's league, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor--if so, this is not a showcase for his attributes. basinger does well and certainly looks good, but james woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role. a sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the '72 film and plays even worse here. as for the action scenes, they're pretty old hat, which causes one to wonder: why even remake the original? ** from ****

i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie. the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic. steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor. he has no passion in his play.also the action in the original "getaway" was fantastic. but the remake has no action! it is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico. i think this is a mistake in the story.so i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like johnny depp or brad pitt...

spoilers throughout: the gettaway is mostly an action movie. and what action there is to!! shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more. it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coy's.this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry. but the movie itself didn't do it for me.the gettaway became really tiresome really quickly. the plot is overshadowed by one fight/chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up, bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in. in fact, by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning. i don't think bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture.this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, certainly not, but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist i can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here. the gettaway isn't terribly original either, and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull. it really could have been better i think.bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives. sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale. didn't enjoy this one to much.

i have not seen this movie in ages but figured i'd comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells. the original the getaway was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) a sam peckinpah movie, 2) featured steve mcqueen, ben johnson, and slim pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.by comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, kim basinger. mcqueen and his then wife allie mcbride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.let's just get it said and out of the way -- alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the cooler king, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role. like someone else points out, peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre. by contrast baldwin, bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only michael madsen's and james woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. one viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. there's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.so i don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing. i'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie & fall flat with something original. this movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release mr. baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in hollywood. thank god for "team america" for putting him in his place.3/10

"this story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose-leaf system." when "politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only a decade old. and, the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group. advocating prohibition, and shutting down speakeasies, was a main concern for women at the time.good-natured marie dressler (as hattie burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy. she wants the liquor-selling joints closed; and, is drafted into a mayoral run, after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally. ms. dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend polly moran (as ivy higgins) and her stuttering husband roscoe ates (as peter higgins). dressler's run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town; so, dressler orders the women to go on strike, denying them, "everything" in the "parlor, bedroom, and bath." the film sounds much better than it turned out. the humor, frankly, isn't too good; and, it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations ("you look like madame queen" refers to an amos and andy character). and, the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well, this time. producers might have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on dressler and the characters played by william bakewell (as benny emerson) and karen morley (as myrtle burns).**** politics (7/25/31) charles reisner ~ marie dressler, polly moran, roscoe ates

tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn. the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner. just count the times tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. the old cliché about it "only happening in the movies" applies here in spades. then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. the static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. in fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. too bad that tieney's career never really gelled. i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. his ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough-guy best. anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.

the film did what it set out to do: show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity. however, for most of us, this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here. the movie fixated on breasts, which soon became boring and i lost interest. if this was on tv, i would've switched to the latest news on the starr report. that's how boring i found this movie.

i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed. slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todd's brand of humor. the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. maybe i missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience i am glad to be a man.

from the critical acclaim, i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins. the story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot. and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity "over with." maybe i am too young to relate (i was four years old in 1976), but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings. the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience. overall, slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, i would say skip this one.

the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it. the characters were stereotypical "white-trash", the movie's "plot" was stunted from the beginning, and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny. regretfully, that was the only funny thing in the movie. ms. jenkins would be better served if in the future, she would refrain from using her life-story to "entertain" people. it was simply that bad. the one positive aspect of this movie (this has nothing to do with the lack-of-quality of the film) is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker.

---what happened to these unlikeable people. alan arkin was, as usual, unfunny and just walks through the role. the kids are all a mess. mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way. and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad, mean movie? if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction, and not try in any way to do better, this is your film. all others, take a walk, read a book, or see something else.jane

this is a story of a jewish dysfunctional family. the parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house. the father, murray abromowitz, moves with his children to california, and moves around beverly hills so that his children can get the best education possible.things really become funny when marisa tomei, murray's niece, comes to lives with the group.the film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood.jessica walter costars as a woman who wants murray to move in with her since she wants a companion.carl reiner and rita moreno come in towards the end. they play murray's brother and sister-in-law respectively; they're also the parents of tomei. in front of the children, reiner lets loose reminding murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along.the film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around beverly hills in their car. i guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self-esteem.

this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen. i'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog, so the language barrier wasn't an issue. i must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie. there is only one professional actor in the cast and i'm guessing no professional directors or writers.although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating. this is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non-event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back.the real shame is that i am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length. however if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give "lost in translation" a 10 as well.

as others have noted, this should have been an excellent hammer-style film, and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it... but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them) that it's all too overblown and self-important. this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr. rock finally realizes what he's done. the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight. freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.

yes, this is one of those movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. i have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie. the other comments give the idea well enough. the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses.but the rat, yes, the big rat. why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. often the 'big one' isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. i surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry.the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. after figuring out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. if you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. really, you need to rent it and see for yourself.but not for more than 99¢, ok?

i enjoy quality crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. i quite enjoyed some of this, but the acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. i don't know who wasted more time, me watching this, or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. i can assure you, it wont. however, on a brighter note, i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie, so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.

nell shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the maxwell automobile's off-road capabilities. the plot of the movie is pretty simple, nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer's block, and needs inspiration, so she goes to visit mexico to absorb the atmosphere. there she meets the hero (bert van tuyle), a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. while nell is visiting with her father's partner at his mining camp, a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. the hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. this is where the film takes a weird twist. bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brush, scraggly tree stumps, steep inclines, etc etc, for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. now mind you, this isn't a modern-day atv, it's a 1920 maxwell automobile, so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle. and it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters, we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. but the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl, he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit (on horseback), and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks, getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush, going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs, the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. but they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. and in a silly climax, the car climbs a mountainside, and helps nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.after seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than hummers and bradley tanks combined. watch this film just for laughs, it's worth it just to see nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying "you did your best, brave little car"

being a fan of silent films, i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. i was pretty disappointed. as has been mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long, commercial for the maxwell automobile. perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is, i may have enjoyed the film more. but it got old very fast. and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without lessening a viewer's enjoyment, what was with the mexican bandits? i mean, they are chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour, yet they can't catch up to it?

nell shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in 'back to god's country' of the previous year, and she failed miserably. this time, she does better, although it seems pointless. 'something new' hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase. there's a brief premise, which sets up the hero (co-author and shipman's boyfriend) to have to save the girl (played by shipman), then it's nothing but an exciting, implausible chase from there. of course, it plays out like an hour-long advertisement for a maxwell sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. it doesn't seem that she learned much from the last-minute rescue films of d.w. griffith or its parodies by mack sennett and other comedians, which she's imitating.one point of interest is that shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film's story, which has as its protagonist a writer (shipman again), although she doesn't do much else clever or humorous with it, even though she attempts to. again, others had pioneered the writer's joke in the intertitles, like anita loos with 'wild and woolly' or frances marion with 'a girl's folly' (both 1917). at least, shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously--and neither do i. 'something new,' despite its claim, is hackneyed.

i doubt jigsaw was hip even at the time, the whole lsd theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture. the dated aspect aside, jigsaw suffers from many problems, including overwrought acting, silly and stilted dialogue, lsd flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. if it was a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook. i saw jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out. at very best, a three out of 10.

bradford dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; having partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", which one character claims to define as elective loss of memory), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hopes of piecing his life back together. abhorrent concoction very loosely based on walter ericson's book "fallen angel" (filmed in 1965 as "mirage" with gregory peck). it was probably too racy for television--what with drugs and hippies added to the mix--that nbc initially refused to air it, which is how this low-budgeter wound up in theaters. director james goldstone gets freaky with the hyperkinetic visuals and camera-tricks, while editor edward a. biery goes wild with the zig-zag cuts. unfortunately, their admittedly-colorful gimmicks cannot cover up the weaknesses of this updated plot, and the acting is woefully overripe. dillman, under pressure to recall the events of the night in question, goes through an actor's seminar of tics, stammers, nose-wipes, and crazy half-laughs while spitting out dialogue like, "dream...a dream...drugs...yeah, drugs...that sound...bells...help!" as a villainous fellow scientist with a cheshire cat smile, pat hingle nearly upstages dillman in the grand thespian department by continually addressing everyone in baby-talk, strutting about like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth around in agony. hope lange's scientist/love-interest is given the short shrift, but not before she screams at indifferent-lover dillman: "what do i have to do, talk ape man? me want you!" this is one frantic "jigsaw"! *1/2 from ****

the immortalizer was, uh, interesting. it certainly didn't kill me during its hour and a half duration, but it didn't impress me much either. a group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinema's least convincing head crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. here dr. divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as freejack! who knew that when you transplant an old person's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice? with all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of from beyond and re-animator dancing in the producers' heads. but the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off. i've never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore. the acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from clarke lindsley as the assistant dr. price. he has a nice evil laugh. the only other thing of note about the immortalizer is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts. seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks.

i just saw this movie on flix after timer-taping it. i grew up watching f troop and had a major hard for wrangler jane so i was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was melody patterson, who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. i would never have guessed it was her in a million years. what the hell is she doing in a picture like this? i agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing. no sex, no gore, no tease. it's also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being roughed up by the cop, all of it boring and time-filling. now if the italians would have made this, half the film would have been the slingblade/uncle ernest/jack elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls. but you only get that for 20 seconds.

the film released at the start of 2000 alongwith mela both disasters so sad to start a millennium with such nonsensethe film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000anywayz some classic gems from the film: paresh rawal i don't understand to laugh at his role or cry reason: he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here?the whole film is a joke can't explain we have anil in a dual role(one older and younger) and rekha playing the older's wife and raveena the youngers we also have reject harish while shakti playing the son of aruna irani who both fight on who has the worst wigdirection is outdated music is badanil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate, raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo

t. rama rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. he's like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.actors are not bad, not good either. anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. rekha is good, but then - she's always good, and here she's nothing more than such. she makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that. in conclusion, nothing great at all. raveena is ok, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing.this film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. maybe it's a delayed film? well, even then it still would be below standard. the script is terrible, the film is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. it feels like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like from the 1950s.don't recommend, unless you're a big fan one of the starring actors.

wwf survivor series 2001this was among the worst events of 2001. perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous survivor series'. there was only one survivor series match. and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes. what's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock prevailing for his team. and don't get me started on the preview before the event. no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f***ing die. there was no need for all of that pointless hype. whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event.and as for the rest of the matches: the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow. it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly. william regal versus tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. edge versus test was good but nothing great. the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place. the women's title match wasn't great. no, not in the slightest. the main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history. the alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned. the match itself was poor. the rock eliminated 3 of them and jericho eliminated 2. the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began. jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match. if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them. everyone knew that kane, big show and undertaker were just fall guys. 7 matches isn't enough for a survivor series. if there's ever a survivor series as bad as this again i'll

this was allocated to the fans as the "winner takes all" match occurred between two separate "companies" (the world wrestling federation and the "alliance": an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars. because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag-team match, the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match, interfernce is necessary. each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches, executes a special move, and tags in a partner. the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf. it was obvious, with that statement, that the wwf would prevail. overall: very innovative storyline but poor execution, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag-team. the remaining matches are just revolting:edge versus test: potent "big boot" by test, but this did not display the true talents of both starsal snow versus christian: good match but superflous to the pay-per-viewtaji versus william regal: the worst match of the nightimmunity battle royal: this was an outstandingly fun match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only a wrestler who characteristically appears on "heat" and is probably a wcw light-heavyweight reject (i.e. the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer)hardy boyz versus dudley boyz: the best match of the night: jeff hardy executed a "swanton bomb" from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage, which appeared to be extremely painful.because stone cold was the wwf champion, rob van dam was the hardcore champion, and kurt angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of "the alliance" were granted work after the match's outcome, except for booker t., who recently attacked a wrestler on "raw" and will inevitably be given work. shane mcmahon will return to television somehow, and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of "the alliance" to see stone cold out of work. the wwf has done much better. a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better, and what ever became of casket and iron man matches?

turkish cinema has a big problem. directors aren't interested in global cinema. they are local and folkloric, but want to be international. this brings kitsch results such this movie.film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don't have any meaning for non-turkish audiences. even for turkish audiences after 10 years.players, even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average. they act like puppets.movie was shot in cuba, but nothing includes about cuba. so cuba is thought like a banana republic.waste of money, waste of time.

it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film. an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in "rabbit test." so, as a small contribution to this future effort, i'd like to suggest this word: "hubiriffic" (adj.) a combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film "rabbit test."joan rivers and "hollywood squares" producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. trying to put together an airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags, (note to joan: german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the catskills - that's is bad enough. but compounding this cinematic crime is river's directorial style, which can best be described as 'ugly', and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags.adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel. watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test. cabbages, mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates. but for self-aware, thinking humans - i'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i'd recommend "rabbit test."

the opening 5 minutes gave me hope. then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie. absolute lowest common denominator humor. painful viewing. a complete chore. written no doubt in less than a week, just like the first one. give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell. and don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something, anything. he has it in him. these austin powers things are just embarrassing. let goldmember sink without trace.

this film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre. no jokes, but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff. the music and the girls are great, unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them. it was weak, very very weak.

possible spoilersthe spy who shagged me is a muchly overrated and over-hyped sequel. international man of mystery came straight out of the blue. it was a lone star that few people had heard of. but it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. the spy who shagged me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.ok i'll admit, the first time i saw this film i thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. the acting was ok, but heather graham cannot act. her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as liz hurley was in the first one. those characters who bloomed in the first one, (scott evil, number 2 etc.) are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand-alone scenes. the film is simply overrun with cameos.in particular, i hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in imom. when they killed off vanessa at the start and had basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. what was the point of that? they killed off number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. this is supposed to be a spy-spoof, i don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. it just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.the new characters are very unwelcome. the whole mini-me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. fat bastard is just a lame excuse for gross-out humour. in total there's about two or three good jokes. the rest are either tasteless or rehashed from imom.if this were the first movie of the series then i'd probably be easier on it. but the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour. so i say, only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor, because the spy who shagged me is one ultimate disappointment.

having enjoyed mike myers previous work (waynes world and saturday night live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. it became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. i swit ched off after ten minutes. i watched it the other day a second time to see whether i had been unfair the first time. i switched it off after ten minutes. i find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could find this funny. the dialogue is an e mbarrassment, myers is painful to watch (as is heather graham) and the succession of characters including fat bastard makes matters even worse. apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. i personally recommend you avoid this like the plague, though several friends of mine enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).º

the concept was ok but hardly original. the acting was plastic. but the real spoiler was that there was only one joke and a grubby one at that. this is a film for fourteen year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time. don't dare to watch it with your kids.

this movie is truly boring. it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why. it's not because it's critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality. i would never want to pay money to watch this. i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china. it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself. the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there's plenty of them. the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad. i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film. the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good. i can't see any reason why people would like this. this is not an art film it's of waste of celluloid.(that's if they actually shot it on film , which they didn't)

i have seen many, many films from china - and hong kong. this is the worst. no, the worst one was 'unknown pleasures'. i watched 'platform' yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang ke's other two films must be better. this evening i was disappointed again. i will not be watching 'xiao wu' tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin! whoever gave this film, 'platform' ten out of ten, needs to watch more cinema! the photography was very poor: it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close-up work. the storyline was so disjointed that i fast-forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration. i would not recommend this film to anyone. give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day. these are true masters of chinese cinema, not pretentious con men!

the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china. however, i found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. two hours in and i was totally past caring. as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china (and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema), i couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. it begs the question: if i disliked it, who on earth would like it? give me zhang yimou, give me chen kaige. give me the work of just about any other chinese director i've ever seen. this sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all. i'd be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.

this movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society. therefore, can thieves, rapists and murderers (the killer of this movie, carl panzram (james woods), is all three and worse) be held fully accountable for their deeds? an interesting notion, but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. and this is where killer: a journal of murder falls very short. although the film tries to put panzram's behaviour into perspective, with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never gets the idea that panzram is a victim rather than a culprit. sure, the system is corrupt, with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of leavenworth prison (where most of the movie takes place), most prison guards are sadistic bullies, and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot. but why on earth does new prison guard henry lesser (robert sean leonard) take such pity on panzram? even after having read his gruesome diaries? the movie offers some explanation: lesser witnesses panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guard, and is impressed by panzram's intelligence (though it isn't clear why exactly lesser thinks this man is so smart). surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like panzram, even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality? towards lesser, panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer is given the impression that for lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in panzram's diaries. does this man lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him? perhaps it is lesser who is a product of modern society, judging on appearance rather than substance.i can advise monster, starring charlize theron and christina ricci, as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope.btw: killer looks as though shot for tv (not so good)

carl panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything selfless for him. the book "panzram: a journal of murder" by thomas e. gaddis and james o. long, which came out the better part of a century after panzram's death, gives the historical context to a first-generation american's account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy, getting caught, thrown in the boy's home, getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized. as panzram grew huge and strong, he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to south america, europe and africa, and it didn't matter what people he raped, robbed, or murdered because we are all equally worthless.this film casts skinny james woods as the rough neck, mean-ass, son of a bitch carl panzram who in the film is a "drunk", overly-dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. the film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner (like robbing former president taft or being released from the oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return). in short, i don't think carl would be too happy.

i rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little laura ingalls for getting involved in something so poorly produced. i am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this swill. it consisted of a weak naive story line, very poor lines, and relied solely on pretty scenery, and pretty people to sell it. unfortunately this was not enough. you would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap. lindsey wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing, anybody who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from los angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world.

my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her. everything about it stinks.as such it is a true classic.who gave it 10/10? were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one?everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film. it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire.

i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohen's greatest fans. he does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonard's reflections on his own life and career. warming and humble. unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't converse the nuances of leonard's musical / literary manner. nick cave, jarvis cocker & beth orton were the exceptions, even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songs.what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him. a lot is said in this respect, but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen. this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge. they view leonard as a special icon, but can't translate their exact value of leonard cohen. the collaboration with u2 is a farce. the entire live registration looks like a rushed job. and just as in the whole film, only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part.the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project. the use of effects such as echo, slow-motion or flashed images are ill placed. some of the camera-work is dismal. part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected. at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. perhaps a reference to his once use of lsd.some unintentional humor ... at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. initially he can't recall the genre's name, until eventually he says it was punk, the punksters really picked up on his music. the next scene in the film is a live cover of 'i can't forget' ..."and i can't forget, i can't forget i can't forget but i don't remember who"

the saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave) seem to have missed the whole point where cohen's intensity lies: by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise, cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears in one.to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces, launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream "i'm a singer!," is a true pain. it's the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennon's "imagine." nothing, simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original. if there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments, it's cohen's art. embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make-up of sex for sale.in this cohen's tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations, all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and, if truth be told, several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show. it's cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material, really, not the other way around: they may have been friends, or his daughter's, he could have become very tender-hearted and in the mood for a gift. too bad it didn't stay in the family.fortunately, but only at the very end, cohen himself performed his majestic "tower of song," but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2, all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home.a sad show, really, and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do.

this film was a disaster from start to finish. interspersed with performances from "the next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves. this leaves little time for the clips of leonard cohen himself, who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence, wisdom and humor. the rest are too busy trying to canonize him as st. leonard or as some old testament prophet. many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially rufus & martha wainright's) or bland under-achievements. only beth orton and anthony got within striking distance of leonard's own versions by using a little restraint. annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurred camera work, use of digital delay on some of leonard cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what's being said) and a spooky, pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?). for the real thing, see the songs from the life of documentary produced by the bbc in 1988.

sure, if you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby in the world, she'd tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world. she's right, at least in her own world.the producers of the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend puffy. oh, well, do i need to say more? i'll break it down for those who doesn't want to do a simple deduction.the whole movie was fake. you may just put a few biggie's mtv video together and call it a movie.the beautiful angela bassett played biggie's mother. the real one in life looks like a dog.i just wonder why he called himself biggie small. big body small dick? big mouth small sound? big fat small eyes? disclaimer: i'm a person of color. so keep your racist remark to yourself.

if you didn't live in the 90's or didn't listen to rapper ever!! this movie might be ok for you, but any for any fan or any single person who ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where i said thats interesting or i didn't know that. another thing that bugged me was it made it look like anything in his life he did was very easy there was no struggle he made jail look easy, selling drugs, and even rapping it wasn't realistic. i think if the movie where released in about 15 years from now it might have more of an impact maybe!!! good rap movies hustle and flow, get rich or die trying not notorious

i thought the movie was ok but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life. i was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual jamaican, that it's driving me crazy. just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. which i completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie. i'm very disappointed, that's like watching a biography story on mark anthony and having arnold play the part. i don't know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which i'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life. i will say the movie was ok besides the major fla!!!!!!

i just rented creep and was not at all impressed. i didn't feel anything in this film. i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. haven't we seen this all before? i didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. i felt bad for him. but then again i couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep? so many questions need to be answered.someone mentioned references to the ps2 game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely.not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.

look,i'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that i wanna say but i will try to make it short but clean...first of all, lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made...how it didn't show anything of notorious and i agree with the most people here saying that it was "hollywood", i mean, what did you expect a real life story? when will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and biggie... its all covered up and buried deep down.second, i'm not against neither 2pac or biggie i love them both but 2pac and lil kim did get embarrassed in this movie for sure...next, for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth, either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about big or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this hollywood teenage movies. use your mind and see though the clouds... there is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic, i did not say 60% of what i have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie i can only say that it could have been a little bit, i mean a much better done. but anyways i'm just some person giving her opinion....no hard feelings...look, i love hip hop and i live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. with all do respect for 2pac and big, like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets, hustling and just grabbing for the paper....the true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all.ok i know that many of you will think that i'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. look i am maybe wrong about something and im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if i'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years i still don't know anything bout 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles i read or how much i support them and listen to their music...like most of you all out there. only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.and for the end i just wanna say for all of ya biggie and tupac fans and family, this two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future try to be better, learn and love each other, think good even for the ones that don't like you, because at the end...its not about how many money or fame u could get and how fast u could get to the top, its about accomplishing your self to the fullest and feeding your soul, your body and mind...because if u manage to do that, you will be living a life even after death!!!! peace and love to ya all!!!! rip biggie,2pac,aaliyah,left eye,jam master jay and the others who make a change in this world!!!!

as a fan of notorious b.i.g., i was looking forward to this movie. i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. jamal woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious b.i.g. a lot of the story follows notorious b.i.g.'s real son, christopher jordan wallace as notorious b.i.g. as a kid. unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean "puffy" combs. in a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing. it was boring, and did not give any information about notorious b.i.g. that fans and non-fans alike did not already know. i was especially disappointed with angela bassett, a very good actress wasted here as voletta wallace. the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious b.i.g. fans will spend tons of money on it. i am unfortunate to say that that happened. it's nowhere close to a good movie. i was expecting so much out of it, but unfortunately i didn't get anything i wanted from this. i think you should definitely skip this one.

if this is supposed to be the black experience, let me out at either the front or back door.a mama's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it's all down hill for him. angela bassett, the one shining grace in this film, plays his over protective, religious mother. despite her anger at how his life has turned, by the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. she allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children.this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. you knew where this film was heading.i literally laughed out loud when at the end, when bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. what man? he had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. that scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher.the east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. all we see are guns blazing.a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence. what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music. the african american community should take umbrage at their very being. who was this classless fat slob who portrayed biggie? he made rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison. i know it was the streets of bedford stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was. what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment.

this film reminded me of the sopranos, and not in a good way. david chase's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when junior soprano went on trial for his life. rather than pursue this riveting (and pivotal) plot line, the writers instead chose to completely ignore it, focusing instead on bobby baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's frozen pasta dish. when something of genuine interest happens in notorious - for example that first, mysterious assassination attempt on tupac shakur that ignited the whole east coast/west coast feud in the first place, and ended up leading to the deaths of both tupac and christopher wallace - the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through. why exactly was tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with suge knight? and was lil' kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex-obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here?none of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film's screenwriters, who are far more interested in depicting wallace's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail. these sequences (including a brain-frazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network tv movie.the storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. but more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work; the film is almost entirely worthless. the reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre plotting, coupled with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should soar, surely) result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only. and the final twenty minutes, in which wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint, quite frankly made me feel like throwing up. on that score, much as with any other, notorious is crass, calculating and compromised.

not exactly my genre, this straight-to-dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers. i'm relatively open minded, and quite a fan of eamonn walker, so i sat back ready to enjoy myself.blood and bone is the story of isiah bone, an ex-con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses. blah blah blah.what a tedious film. i understand that films like this don't rely hugely on plot, but do they have to stuff in such a silly, predictable and entirely stupid storyline? it may not be important, but by golly gum does it annoy me. better no plot and pure action than a clíche-ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative. infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards. i should probably at this point mention what is, of course, the film's drawing point: the fighting. even in itself, the fighting is rather poor. bone manages to take out well established tough-man street fighters in single punches (a large oaf or two is the filmmakers' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy. even this is repetitive and stupid, arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again.a run of the mill, film-by-numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again. and not even particularly well.

a black guy fights ..... and supposedly wins .... yeah ... 1/10. obviously fiction.so we're presented with a damm nice title, a real nice tag line and even a nice plot line .. thats about it, thats where it ends.. we move into fiction after that.michael jai white, the black guy so don't get confused with the name.. portrays a black guy.. umm, thats all there is to the name..its so hard to find decent help, must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget, low ineptness of this movie, has the camera's shadow trailing the first scenes.... yeah obvious idiot moment for the average guy like you and me.. but yeah...10 lines. review submitted,. if you paid to see this movie, you got screwed.

there is absolutely no plot in this movie ...no character development...no climax...nothing. but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. so there you go...as a movie overall is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie. do not expect nothing more that just that.decent acting and a not so bad direction..a couple of cameos from kimbo and carano...i was looking to see carano a little bit more in this movie..she is a good fighter and a really hot girl.... white is a great martial artist and a decent actor. i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art..imagine a film with white and jaa together...that would be awesome

creep - "your journey terminates here." some very graphic scenes and...well, yeah, that's about all for this film.no real plot, no storyline. no likable characters, well, 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is. i mean, they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing? why is he there?), that's quite scary i guess, but do i really care? no, i don't. why don't i? because i don't have a clue who these people are and i don't know if i should want them to live or die. it's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.this film lacks any meaning, any purpose. it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up. it jumps right into the action. basically, some women and her friends get locked in the london underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are ok, but that isn't what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.it's nothing new. another predictable modern 'horror', where kate (the lead 'character') consistently does the stupid "hey, i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! i'm going to do the total opposite because i'm a dumb blond" thing. i wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. in fact, i'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the, erm, grey alien-looking creature."your journey terminates here" is the films tag line. well, creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film. if you've had a few beers, got a couple of mates back at yours,then sure, watch it by all means. but if you want something original and clever, avoid.

basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'death line' which ironically was like this cobblers, also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station.making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych, this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not this film's strong point.indeed strong points are sadly lacking. the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device.franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often, indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film, out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin. if you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of death line (aka raw meat).if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film, you will need to change trains.....

this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. there are two routes to take in horror films: either you don't really explain what's going on (or who the killer is, like in texas chainsaw massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained (halloween could potentially be an example of this).unfortunately, creep fails in this area. i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. no character is fully realized, although the circular nature of kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.in the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film.this film will go down as another example of a film (as most are) that could be so much better even though it would never be great. the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting: the characters, story, direction, and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.creep does serve a purpose as a mindless, silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it...

please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen...ever. just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.so, it officially begins with a party. just your average party but there's some guy there. he's pretty into kate...if you know what i'm saying. memorise his face; it'll help later.so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney (didn't i say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. that's london underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. so the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. now kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground. alone. well, almost...so the movie just carries on from there. blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.in short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. or as the case may have it, creep.i'd say give it a go if you're into saw, hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us, scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.

okay i must say that before the revealing of the 'monster'. saying that he really didn't fit into that category, just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing, but anyway. i actually was getting into this film, although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't come as an appeal. but such scenes as when she runs away from the train, and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen.but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror, with limited thrills or scares. slowly i became more bored, and wanted to shut the thing off. i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it, specially the guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are! just boring and well not worth the money.if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a mindless gore fest (which is limited, hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go, but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else, much better films out there.

to be honest, this film is another in a series of huge disappointments...most of these so-called "masters of horror" films are only horrifying in terms of their sub-par effects and laughable story lines...aside from ron perlman, everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life...the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop-it under the boom mike or something, and looked completely unrealistic...overall, this film is about as scary as home alone...the only good masters are cigarette burns, jennifer, and maybe pelts...i don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand...

could anyone please stop john carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation? how low can you go? it seems this man has lost any self respect.this episode looks like it has been done by a film student, it isn't even worth beginning to talk about what was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation...come on, mr. carpenter, please retire immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from escape from l.a. to ghosts of mars.get drunk instead.

a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific, but, instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death, despite the title itself. being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twist with it's sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go, never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to "the end"..

i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween/the fog/christine/the thing - probably his best films.then you got this pos. i can't logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns. at least his son made a decent soundtrack.you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie. it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing. i won't believe carpenter put any effort into this at all.i was just listening to his old school h2/h3/the fog soundtrack and it was awesome, especially for the times.he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films.

there is this girl and she's running in the woods but she ends up at this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion. her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it. the whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic. i'm not really pro-choice but i wanted the choice to kill this episode. i was laughing when i saw the baby come out and it went into the corner. the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too. i was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode. he just wanted to protect his daughter and i couldn't really blame him for what he did. i don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. i was just laughing too hard and i would suggest watching "pick me up" instead of this episode. it wasn't the worst episode but it wasn't that great.

this installment of masters of horror was terrible. apparently, mr. carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent, plausible dialog. there were times when i literally shouted at the tv for something to happen. maybe he thinks he building suspense, but carpenter needs to trim back that overdone, over-simplified musical score of his (or his son's) and advance the action a little bit. how many times did the girl say, "oh no, i can't have this baby!" and "oh, no here it comes"? carpenter takes elements from much, much better films (assault on precinct 13 and the thing) and throws them in here as if we are supposed to acknowledge and appreciate his trademark style. what is lacking here is genuine suspense and energy. it's as though he's sleepwalking through the process of movie making. for better carpenter films, stick to the tried and true classics-- the thing, halloween, and they live. for better masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: family, jenifer, and dreams in the witch house.

wow. the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists. i know a lot of those. the guys that'll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror. this "movie" is utter crap. it looks and sounds like a porno (good lord, the soundtrack is awful...), and has sub-par porn acting, which is shocking, because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor. i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this. most likely "beans, beans, beans.." until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day... they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever, when they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it's the devil's baby?) but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed. it's just awful. like, plan 9 from outerspace awful. like, good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful. try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode.

"masters of horror" has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes,' and while a definite case can be made for joe dante's 'screwfly solution' (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). and 'pro-life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young angelique (caitlin wachs), seen running through the woods, is nearly hit by 2 doctors (mark feuerstein and emmanuelle vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. angelique's father, dwayne (ron perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. if for nothing else, 'pro-life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. even when dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion,' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. the poor performances (perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script, and carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'pro-life' is the source of his next hot meal. by the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking...

well well well. as good as john carpenter's season 1 outing in "masters of horror" was, this is the complete opposite. he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with "cigarette burns" but "pro-life" is perhaps the worst i have seen from him.it's stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome, despite the less-than-an-hour running time. the script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.and for those suckers who actually bought the dvd (one of them being me); did you see how carpenter describes the film? he's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. and in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut, he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. i fear the old master has completely lost his touch. i sincerely hope i'm proved wrong.i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome, though. technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and make up effects.

i went into a video store and looked around to find some horror movies, after about 30 minutes i just rushed and picked out a few. i stumbled upon "masters of horror" which contained "pro-life" and "right to die". they seemed ok, same-old cheesy horror crap, but i was interested for some reason. it said about pro-life on the case about being a classic, a return to form for john carpenter (i loved his "the thing", so i thought this would be good) and all that. so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting, i was very wrong... it started off casual, just a girl running through a forest, scared of something. a car stops and picks her up (just so being the people she needed to see, amazing?) they take her back to some clinic and examine her, at the sametime all this is happening her father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in, he isn't aloud near the area. most likely from something he would of done in the past, but you don't know of any of this at the moment. he really does not want his daughter in this place, an abortion center. he is very strongly against such acts, believing it's sickening and not what "god" would want. he "supports" what i heard is called "pro-life". acting against abortions and going to extremes to allow the babies to be born, they are sick. they don't like the life of an unborn being taken, yet they've killed humans in the past to allow the birth? justice is only a figment of the mind. anyway, back on track, after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant, but far ahead than what she should be. she is only a few weeks pregnant, but is months ahead. she keeps telling them they wont understand her, and that she wants an abortion and all, but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a demon from hell, and that her father wants this baby (but believes "god" wants this baby, not who truly does). he gets his 3 sons (they arm themselves with pistols and shotguns), and begin to make they're way into the clinic (shooting down anyone who won't co-operate). the head of the clinic, who must of had trouble with them in the past, is well prepared this time. ends up killing one the fathers sons, but in the end gets shot a few times (wearing a bullet proof jacket). the father then performs what he believes is done to the women. he cuts a hole, where the vagina would be if he we're a female, and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood. whilst all this is happening, the girl gives birth to some demonic baby with many legs, and some demon raises from beneath the earth (not in the same room) and starts looking for its child. the father sees this later on, and starts questioning why this happened, he did what he was told to do, and doesn't understand why it's like this. the demon had killed both of his sons earlier, and now goes for father... whilst the girl kills the baby, and the demon carries it away (not in the same scene).yeah, it probably sounds pretty cool, and a thrilling horror movie, but it isn't. the acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm, the script is boring and not even creative, they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them; just everything put together, all the small parts, don't even add up to something great, a waste of time. i wouldn't classify this as a horror, though it has elements of horror, they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed. it felt more like a "beginners" short-movie, than by john carpenter.sorry for my lack of information, and detailed review, i just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting. also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect, i couldn't really be bothered to research anything.

i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter's episode in season 2 because his first, cigarette burns, was by far the best from season 1 (and i did like other episodes from that season). oh, how i was disappointed.in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing. the characters, aside from the subject matter, seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker, texas ranger. the acting was bad, and i normally like ron perlman a lot, but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible. i'm not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror (obviously) with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion. in this case, not surprisingly, it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti-abortionists. and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency. this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing.while i don't think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for. there are a couple small bits that i found nice, hence the 2 stars i gave it.the actual gore and monster effects were good, but the cgi gore (two separate gunshots to the head) were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should've never been given the ok. i'm generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle. i have a problem with the execution of it. the technology, while amazing in some respects, is not good enough to match "real" effects, whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and/or alive, and therefore shouldn't be used until they are. cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated.i'll also take this opportunity to note that the show title, masters of horror, is a bad title to have. there simply aren't many actual "masters of horror" around. maybe two or three. if the show were called "tale of horror" or something like that it would be fine. but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes, and therefore being criticized for not being a "master of horror" is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career. and it didn't even have to be a good one.

slight spoilers (but it doesn't matter anyway).an exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines i need to put these remarks on the netwaves. this is the single worst episode of the masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct mystery science theatre treatment. even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very lame mess. its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are put to use. here they are absent and john carpenter is no master. period. and no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that. oddly, carpenter never has been anything more than a b director, but at least such films as 'fog' and 'the thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).abominable acting. camera angles stuck in cement. tensionless rhythm. yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course jc cannot really be blamed for (unless the writers were buddies of cody.) the initial two minute slo-mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be scully-mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film. but come on, a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez-vous with the fender of a pair of 'women's rights' mds whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner. oh, and i won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds. does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.then things fall apart real quick. the vacuous dialogue "i just want to help you", the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of cell phones?) followed by the the shoot-out: a born-again ramboesque clinic director vs ron perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at easter break. another lovely line: "so what are we going to do?" from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. er, no it isn't yet pheasant season. so who needs those teen boys anyway. what about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all-american suv?as for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves, the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a dc comics strip. all that was lacking were the wham, bam, and whiz of the balloon titles. and all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old mannix episode.at one point we learn that daddy isn't really the daddy, but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either. this story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins. yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are actually ever found together. they remain mere abstractions to each other throughout.with the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable. bland, hysterical, dull-headed, macho. as perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. none of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. and there's that bickering dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend. he fortunately got his. there are two great mst-worthy comic moments: the gusher when angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby's head. also cute was angelica's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right-to-life little monster from hell. as for that audacious male abortion scene...well, they should have retained miike's episode and banned this one instead.in short, a 3rd rate rosemary's baby meets alien set on the turf of a m.a.s.h. episode. this stinker alone, appreciable only to today's permissive under-16 generation, will assure as someone else said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. a real shame, since there have been a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs as dante's 'homecoming' or mckee's deliciously quirky 'sick girl'. not to mention the superb imagery of malone's 'fairhaired child'.sorry john carpenter, i believe your directing days are over. it's time to run for president.

two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. we ought to have liked a man called sledge; but.....but... this picture is disagreeable, annoying and stupid from start to finish. since there is nobody in the story (good or bad) to warm up to, there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested. no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold, and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it. sledge has a pretty girl friend, but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score, and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow.of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault, this was the rock bottom, the only true dud in the bunch.

it's possible that a man called sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day, but i seriously doubt it.james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out. folks like dennis weaver, claude akins, john marley. and of course we have vic morrow who both wrote and directed this film.garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he's so darn good at playing them. but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children's hour and hour of the gun. he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. but a man called sledge can't be counted as one of his successes.he's got the title role as luther sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style measures, he's followed from the saloon by john marley.marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. garner gets his gang together for a heist.here's where the movie goes totally off the wall. usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. certainly that was the case in the war wagon which some other reviewer cited. but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us marshal dennis weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. that was just too much to swallow. if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns, during that prison break there's enough there for three movies.that's not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits. but for the life of me i can't find him in the film. maybe a chorus of the donkey serenade might have made this better.couldn't have hurt any.

was it a thriller, as i thought when i saw the cover at the video library? no. was it a 'food fr thought' as the author was maybe trying to make it? not really. so what was it? it was a very average movie, that had great potential, and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points, beginning middle and end, with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy, who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall. it was nice cinematography, with good colours, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been. and with a feeling of let's just quickly wrap it up in the end. ok to watch if there's nothing else on tv.

i'm not a big fan of the stooges' slapstick, but i find their history interesting. i've recently tried to check out stuff from each stooge era, but the opportunity to see joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy; this is the only one i've seen so far.some say the quality problems with joe-era shorts are really not joe's fault, and i suspect that's the case. joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this. the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment: the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy-team/stooges ethos. perhaps joe's style was perceived, by those in charge, as not really fitting in -- though there were no real off-camera conflicts between him & the others -- and this was their way of working around that.and what's with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts? definitely a lack of creativity going on there; was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up?

the real irony is this: joe besser was a top notch comedian, in other situations away from the stooges. he had a definite track record for being very funny and clever. moe and larry and shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work. so what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the "third stooge"? obviously, nothing. in most of these "late stooge" era shorts, more often than not, the boys are pitted against each other or joe against the other two and this is not accurate stooge etiquette. "one for all, all for one, every man for himself", to quote curly from "restless knights". one thing about a good comedy team, laurel & hardy, abbott & costello, the marx brothers, no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around, when the chips are actually down, they stick together and come to each other's aid. in this particular one, none of that happens. it's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty, and not for comedic effect either. one might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here, art imitates life. maybe there really was hence why besser did not stay very long with moe and larry. just look at the history of the other teams and tell me i'm wrong.

i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television. but the version put to dvd was a disaster. the lighting was poor to non-existent and entire scenes were simply excised. in one instance adele is being put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid-sentence - where it's the next night. characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced, leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie.the dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at $6.32 it was a gyp.be careful which version of this movie you buy! we're sending this one back.

this tv production of 1970 starring susannah york and george c. scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt "jane eyre" to the screen, and how much can go wrong in doing so. it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd - some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence! but even if the editing were better, the film would not be. the script is bad, the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast. as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte brontë's novel at all. the problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out - this is the case with all the short adaptations - but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone, the spirit, the atmosphere and the concept of the novel.this jane eyre for example completely leaves out gateshead and begins with jane's arrival at lowood. while this is perfectly all right, since some scenes must by necessity be left out, it is not understandable that, instead of using the time gained (so to speak) and thoroughly portraying jane's friendship with helen, the influence helen has for jane's development, the lecture in christian stoicism that she teaches her, the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill-treatment of helen, which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation. what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel, but here miss scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward, who deliberately wants to drive helen to a premature death. and this is about all which happens at lowood. if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in lowood have on jane in the novel, one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in jane's life. and this is the problem throughout this adaptation: it rushes from scene to scene, very often without transition, and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel. the dialogues are an odd mixture of made-up lines and lines from the novel, very clumsily patched together, and the scenes between jane and rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love, and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance, the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel. but the scriptwriter not only did brontë's language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral set-up with just one sentence. when rochester and jane go to see rochester's wife after the would-be wedding, rochester says: "yet i once loved her (his wife) as i love you now." the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved, and that his effort to seek a true life partner is, if not sanctified by god's and man's law, yet understandable and forgivable! but this one sentence completely undermines brontë's whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer.from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting: now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays, but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely, blonde, blue-eyed and full-mouthed susannah york as the novel's plain heroine. in addition, ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it. played by her, the novel's shy, reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly poised, graceful and mature woman, completely sure of herself and her deserts. i do not say that susannah york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not brontë's jane eyre. to cast george c. scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible. scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70.to compliment the "maturity" of the leading actors all passion, desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script. the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding, the emotional climax of the novel, has become a calm, rational conversation between two middle-aged persons, at the end of which rochester falls asleep. when jane returns to him in the last scene, he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old people's home by his favourite granddaughter. the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st. john, of all people. ian bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for jane's love is so touching that one gets the impression that bannen was modelling his st. john on the rochester of the novel. but good though bannen is, his st. john is just as far from the novel as york's jane and scott's rochester. the only redeeming features of this very disappointing "jane eyre" are the locations and the score, and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of "jane eyre".

i watched this film, along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on- including seeing plays- in preparation for some academic research. the cinematography is very moving, as is the music. unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story. i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr. rochester. all of his most fundamental traits are gone. where is his wit? where is his passion? scott's rochester more closely resembles rochester's foil, st.john, than the character from the novel. in fact, the actor playing st.john in this adaptation played a passionate st.john while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling (which he does all the time). i have no idea what they were thinking. i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly can't bear to see this film for too long because of george c. scott's performance.

the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way. the script, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, the pointless sub-plots, the dreadful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen. i found nothing likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. if so, they failed utterly. it just bored me, and i wish i had never watched it.avoid at all costs.

i can't believe i've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film. if there is only one film you have to miss, this is the one.robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti-social teenagers and using drugs. all these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodes...the first thing is that i don't think i can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any single character. if the director considers what i saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy, i have to say that that's not even close.the use of cinematography is also not mature. most of the time i couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and i didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. everybody happy except the audience.the plot is particularly weak. there are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them.in the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking, talking and moving. so i really can't comment on acting here.nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though. maybe this is the only good thing.i have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch scary movies). this is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience. hope you fall into neither group.

with a title "borrowed" from werner herzog and liberal helpings of kubrick, haneke and noe it is painfully obvious that thomas clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our british cinema churns out. "robert carmichael" (for short) sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the iraq war. the problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the fetid imaginings of "extreme" filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists. as a critique of the iraq war, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual)is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about. there are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. like kubrick and noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film. people liked "clockwork orange" and "irreversible" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated. so too much kubrick and not enough haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years. (i am not against violence in film. to do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered alex in "clockwork orange" showing how kubrick's supposed intent was missed by miles. gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art-film directors.)

badly made. dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gijón film festival.everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i - what was the point of even making the film? the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. i am astonished that this film has been given a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. sorry, terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake. what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film - now that could have been interesting.

i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam (jan '06) and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards. many people reacted shocked and protesting. he will get a lot of negative critics. but: the world is cruel like this, and it's not funny. people don't like it. that itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad. i can see that difference. don't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our 'hubble'! nevertheless i think this a bad movie. film-technically it's a good one. nice shots and script, most good fitting music, great actors. the director pretends to make a psychological movie, - the psychology however is of poor quality. describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art. the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence. how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty? the director pretends to describe that, - but is not good in that.the director used several times the word the 'selfishness' of people, mentioning for instance the teacher. only: this teacher wasn't selfish,- just someone in several roles, caring for his pupils, ánd worried about his script. i think it's a simplification to call him selfish. the atmosphere in the village is creepy, and the mother made awful mistakes ('you terribly let me down') but it doesn't become believable for me, that there is caused súch a lot of pain, that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things. in fact, reality is far more complex than the way, this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions. the interesting thing would be: how does it work? describe that process for me please, so that we understand.with the written phrase on the end, the director said to point to an alternative way of life. it was the other extreme, and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists, promoting black/white-thinking. the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved. use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right. there are enough black/white-thinkers in the world, causing lots of war and misery. i hope, this movie won't be successful.

at the end of the film i just asked myself :"is it the worse movie i have ever seen or is it the worse movie i have ever seen ?". and the answer is... actually, after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it, you just can't find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes, which are unbelievably brutal and useless. it seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowd's head : "what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination ?" because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and it's horrors (during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president bush's speeches about the necessity of starting a war with iraq and in the second scene, the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a woman's vagina, are directly followed by archive pictures of world war ii. but as a matter of facts, i really could not think about the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horror's expression, being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt. (sorry for bad english)

this cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. the characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. instead clay makes robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. one wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. no one can save poor robert. clay leaves us with the message that young british men are out of control. a very unsubtle link is made to the iraqi insurgents; during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. the film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. the young bombers in london draw a parallel with clay's hateful depiction of modern male. clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. it is a wonder the british film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda, when in london we are still reeling from the recent attacks. this is clay's first film, i would be delighted if it is his last.

first a technical review. the script is so slow, it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. the dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. the "acting" is pathetic, they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board. as for the whole "point" of the story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there's a shock!) is really non-existent. without out the "lets shock 'em and get great publicity" scene nobody would be talking about this film. it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on. believe me i've seen some bad "emperor's new clothes" films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this! read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don't talk about it.

this is the most disturbing film i have ever seen. it makes "requiem for a dream" look like a disney film. although, technically, it is reasonably well made, acting, cinematography, music, directing, etc., are good. however, the concluding gang rape scene is the most appalling and violent thing i have ever seen and i really wish i had not seen it. i am afraid that it will haunt me for the rest of my life. although i think anyone would find the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victimized in a very similar manner and i really didn't need an explicit reminder of the horror that they experienced. i saw the film at the sxsw film festival in austin, tx and none of the cast or crew were in attendance. i would have liked for them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which i felt was excessive, gratuitous and unnecessary. an earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they were apparently striving for, but without rubbing your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence. this film should have a big warning label on it. for these reasons i would not recommend anyone seeing it. you've been warned.

i have seen it. it's not "good" but interesting in an understated way. the boys in it are quite naturalistic but................the graphic/gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance. real atrocity is real- this film is just atrocious. however, the film has a look which can draw you in. but it seems to me that is the "emperor's new clothes", but in fact in reverse. the film looks good, but the direction, story, content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous. if a feeling can be vacuous-this is it.

i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw. i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible. since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable. there is nothing to be said but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. the people involved should be ashamed.

i saw this at the edinburgh film festival. it was awful! every clichéd, violent, rich boy fantasy was on display, you just knew how it was going to end especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl.the worst part was the q&a with the director/writer and writer/producer they tried to come across as intellectuals but you could tell they're the types that get off on violence. i bet anything they frequent brothels and do drugs.don't waste your time. i had to keep my boyfriend from walking out of it.

violence whether real or not always has an impact. in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for. in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of. but what was the point? the violence looks like a mix of noë's 'irreversible, and ' kubrick's 'clockwork orange'...both of which are remarkable films. don't get me wrong, i'm not opposed to screen violence at all and i've seen some nasty stuff in my film-going years, but this film as a whole is totally juvenile. the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence, the rizla paper thin reason we are give for robert's demise is his introduction to drugs. danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for robert's drug fuelled demise, however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes. lesley manville is robert's unable to cope mum, i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber. the acting is wooden, the scene in the kitchen with the tv-cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale- who wrote those dialogues?! some of the comments the boys make...'looks like she's enjoying it' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clay's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals. why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery...one can only wonder at this young man's psychology.the 'political meaning' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes; in the bar, outside the tv-cook's house, war in iraq reports, was perhaps too obvious in my opinion. yes, war is violent, social determinism causes frustration, we're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping e. juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man. this issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film.my opinion: derivative, badly-made and pointless.

so they hyped the violence and it's been branded as sick. well, the violence is the best bit i'm afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their (entirely predictable) rampage. this film has a truly dreadful script. we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic. the acting isn't much better, either, the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher. the direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep. and what on earth is the school film project all about? a comment on the film itself perhaps? the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable. these guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth. how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i'll never know. and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery. absolutely awful beyond comprehension.

thomas clay has been mixing with the wrong types. that's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect.seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. the action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if, like it's director, it has no where better to go. we are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do. robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist.the film is really about clay's total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts. clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our tvs. yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of simulated violence. is this guy for real?if clay has not seen youtube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film? all anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and i am sure that will be what sticks with people. the rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status.shame on all involved.

this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer. the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter).the main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from "a clockwork orange") is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. at least in my opinion.to wrap it up: shockingly brutal, revolting and not worth your time. see "a clockwork orange" or "le pianiste" instead.

there is just one word for this film. appalling. the director clearly has talent but like his character robert carmichael he throws it all away.carmichael has potential, but like cray he can't be bothered to use it. being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is cray's vision of british youth. like the british tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. cray cries out for attention, but deserves none.i was appalled by the act of violence that cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience. he assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee.some actors of quality have small parts in this film. danny dyer and leslie manville both make short appearances. the acting is otherwise amateur, the young men joe and ben are cringe making. carmichael played by daniel spencer is creepy. miranda wilson plays monica, the attractive wife of celeb chef jonathon (michael howe); how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. the film is never subtle and monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action. war imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves, that acts of violence will occur within even "civilised" countries. this is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position, but cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images. the female characters in the film offer no relief. they are either victims or in manville's case a washed out mother. the community is represented as dysfunctional.this is cray's first film. i listened to what he had to say during a q and a session at edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. the film is due to be released later this year, but i hope the company goes bust cos the public really don't need this kind of messed up material.

i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film. look at it a month later and you might see it differently, or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first. after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere, it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself. shane danielsen (artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival), aided by the film's director and producer, gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience. edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked. only one person walked out in disgust. the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m.a. film directors. this was not an overly 'shocking' film. there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence, but far less extreme than many movies (most actual weapon contact was obscured, as were aroused genitals). the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring, where the acting standards were not high, where the plot was poor, predictable and drawn out, and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie. metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived, over-emphasised and sloppy (apart from a general allusion to violence, any deeper meaning is unclear); and the 'fig-leaf' reference marquis de sade, as one audience member put it, seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale.we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him (he stands out at school for his musical ability) but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence. when pushed, robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him.the film is not entirely without merit. the audience is left to decide how robert got that way: was it the influence of his peers? why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life? cinematically, there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back (whether through too much drugs, shyness, a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn?). several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room, partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen. in the foreground of the bare bones flat, a dj is more concerned that the girl's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman. ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention. the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way. robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground.but the rest of the film, including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable (if not overly realistic) sexual violence, is not up to this standard. some people have had a strong reaction to it (the filmmakers' stated intention: "if they vomit, we have succeeded in producing a reaction") but mostly - and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes - they feel, "why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making?" director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision. his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet, even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms, but unfortunately they do not apply to his film, any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates, or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols. wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt, i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening, but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial. there are many truths. one aspect of art is to educate, another to entertain, another to inspire. i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach (one of the many great names he takes in vain) without going so far as to admit any agenda himself. he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth. i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director, or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art. clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries. sadly, his ability at the moment only extends to making high-sounding excuses for a publicity-seeking film.

this is the worst movie i have seen since "i know who killed me" with lindsey lohan. after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this. hey, tim burton, i used to be a big fan of yours... did you even screen this movie? i mean seriously, what the f%#k?without giving anything away, here is the story in a vague nutshell... nine wakes up, he does stuff, his actions and decisions are irrelevant... and the movie ends. oh wait... here comes a spoiler...spoiler alert! spoiler alert! at the end of the movie.... it rains. i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie.

nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had, if you can imagine that. there is no decipherable plot or story, the special effects are a joke, and even the sound is terrible. this film was directed by henry sala. it was the only film that he ever directed, and the reason is obvious.

sniffing girl's panties kills a guy...and a stupid freaky puppet says a lot of stupid freaky things......my eyes could not leave the screen, my finger could not leave the fast forward button....i had to rewatch this spectacle to see if i had really experienced what i thought...i did.....god help us all!

somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed, zombie-like killers. the "guinea pigs" for the experiment are scantily-clad, nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons. this movie is awful, atrocious, and amazingly bad. it has little to no logic in the script. you really will have trouble following what is going on. it has no special effects. the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen. and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair(looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it) named george that is like a personal servant/confidant to jessica(the leading "actress"). throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterings of this puppet. but wait...you also get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place. none of the actors are good. there are just varying degrees of bad. the gore and "horror" aspects are especially ineptly filmed. the film really looks like an adolescent put it together. no coincidence henry sala, the director by name but not by trade, has not made another film. i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid, silly, dreck! and how bout the ending? what happened? if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out. all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore!

there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is. it simply defies description. something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. the whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! i'm not making this stuff up. the computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.the "film" is total trash. surreal bad trash. spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very hot or erotic. there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.definitely one of the worst movies ever made. up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video boardinghouse, or boogeyman ii (both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on.

that's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil, ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments. meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs. a biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter jessica (debra hunter), who is in love with another biker (dale midkiff, from pet sematary), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! back at the house, the sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. a small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling, killer zombies!if that isn't enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song ("nightmare fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) that warns "danger! danger!" just like the lost in space robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men!this filmed-in-florida mess is so mind-numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in. and, hey isn't that nypd blue's detective jill kirkendall turned cnn newscaster andrea thompson as one of oft-nude bimbos? sure is! supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985.score: 1 out of 10 (and i mean that in a good way!)

this was a cute movie until the ending. the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her. it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back. this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. it was a despicable movie for that reason.

i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars. the line about "have you even seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows. do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game, your gonna be glad ya did!

very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really didn't care who would fare the best (or was that the purpose of the film, to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted new york city folks?) no romance here, no comedy either. acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies. man, can't you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? try to be original yourself! a small budget is no excuse at all, first-time director neither. crappy, crappy, crappy. no wonder it only cost me one buck...

the broken is part of the after dark horrorfest iii. not a slasher or filled with gore. plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from france and writer/director sean ellis. a successful radiologist gina mcvay(lena headly)inters a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control. while attending her father's(richard jenkins)birthday party, the guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason. things get really strange when she witnesses a woman that is the spitting image of herself driving down a london street in a car identical to her own. gina sneaks to her doppelganger's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father. she drives away and is involved in a head on collision. then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; to be exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust. is gina beside herself? is she in a parallel world? her nightmares become more horrific...is she broken?kudos if you can figure this one out...it won't be easy. editing couldn't be any tighter. lighting is questionable. other players: melvil poupard, william armstrong, michelle duncan and ulrich thomsen.

this film really tries to hard. if your going to make a horror film, at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer. you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesn't. instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything. what was the point of the movie ? where it's actually going ? and more importantly what the hell was going on . . . why were they there and how does it tie into anything? just another weak sci-fi horror. i love the fake reviews on imdb saying how great it is by related press releases to bump the movie (either that or people have low horizons). it's not worth your 2hrs at all.i'm not saying the film is better than the fragile, but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result. this doesn't and it just waffle's on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary. this film is about as low as when a stranger calls. god that was lame too. big tip, if your gonna make a horror, make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook into your story. because if there's no reasoning or believability then there's no firm hold on anything and it can't be scary. no disrespect to the cast or crew cause they did a good job. it's just the poor writing.

you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made... this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot. and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story. the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into 'yet again', which on its own would be depressing but here it's overkill. the idea that it's not a medical condition, not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her, just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug. some doppelgangers have super powers but others don't or don't know they do? it seems they're just as clueless as we are.it's a poor man's rip-off of "invasion of the body-snatchers" with keifer sutherland's "mirror" and "the sixth sense", were you to seriously botch those three together.

no,basically your watching something that doesn't make sense. to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story.a normal everyday to day women, is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car. she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family.i specifically made an account to comment on this film, of how horribly written this was. the acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic. i'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this, usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking, what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing.spoiler starts__they had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. it was not elaborated on all during the film, and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened. nothing gets explained during the film. the main character shouldn't of even been the main character. at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away (her sisters boyfriend) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after. i bought this movie for $10, threw it out right after.. don't waste your time. i really hope nothing like this is made again.

have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house? or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert? yeah. imagine stretching that image to a whole movie, you pretty much got the idea of broken, though there's no detectives in this movie, i'm just using it as a visual example. but, the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99% of the screen time. i got nothing to complain about that woman, she's a perfect choice for this role.i consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and i can truly enjoy some really moody stuff. it would be really cool if i can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. let's be honest here, the acting is superb. some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching.now onto the problem of this movie. beyond the mood, there's not much anything else here. the director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth. i don't consider it to be a spoiler if i say the obsession is "mirror". let's face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director got to work with. granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there. if you paid any attention, nothing is going to surprise you in the end, obvious plot holes aside.now, i'm not picking bones with this style of art since i enjoyed them most of the time. i still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express. movie is not a piece of music, or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. it's all that plus a good story and character development. i consider the lynch style of movie making cheating. it is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. we gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting.this movie is not completely lynch style, thank goodness. it has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. it does not have much story or character development. it presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface. it does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it. the oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. maybe the coherency remains in director's head but from what i can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen.where did he put his effort in then? it seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music. the music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease. only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized.in the end, i felt like: ok, i know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension? it is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. and we are given very little about who the characters are. all we have is this circumstance that just took placed. disappointing but i guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows.

i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. definitely, the broken is not one of those movies. i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i've read in prior comments, they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. it's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. so, you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. had the clues been planted more in the movie, one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. but though the movie was so slow in pace, it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. and the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. furthermore, if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end, then how come she is the evil one? i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! they're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest, i guess. horror movies should have blood, screams, intensity, skeletons, body organs and parts. because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality. i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. for instance, the horror movie "train" with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with "hostel", it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them.and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message, it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. i prefer the addiction message presented in requiem for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex, tv, safety/being pampered, etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial, are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils, ecstasy, leadership lessons (believe it or not!), entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and scary as it may seems, death!

if the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate, everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck, because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here. if only the script was as shattering as the glass, then "the broken" would have been a brilliant film. now it's sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. sean ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. i got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and "meaning" of the film. he thinks ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die. interesting theory, but i'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the internet about this, neither. personally, i just think "the broken" is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of "invasion of the body snatchers" but without the alien interference. "the broken" centers on the american mcvey family living in london, and particularly gina. when a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. when dismissed, gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. she doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? writer/director sean ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them. "the broken" is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. there's a frustratingly high amount of "fake" suspense in this film. this means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. by the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore. some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly sean ellis' style with the repertoires of david lynch, stanley kubrick and even alfred hitchcock, but that is way, way  way too much honor. ps: what is up with that alternate spelling; the one with the scandinavian "ø"

what an incredible fall for sean ellis.you gather a bunch of your friends at home, all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis. you have an vague idea of the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations.it is late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type.15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up, at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches. over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day.a few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this, in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images. any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy. but that legacy can only carry you so long, this is a new level of boring movie-making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions, this is what it is.decent cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either. there are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time.final words, stay away.

i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody).there is no real twist (which is fine) , but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either (how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror?).admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.

horror movie??really???? i cant believe how bad this movie was,what the point of this movie??? the movie almost 1h and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it,is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident....not much talking at all,not even much actions at all.. i have to say tho,the last 20 minuets it got little tiny action.. and was still stupid....... and the end oh my god,i don't know where to begin,it also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol.. don't get me wrong i love lena headey,i think she is great actress,but i don't know what got into her to do this movie.. don't waste your time and watching it,because this movie has no story,has no acting ..and has no point...not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever.

this film is pure, distilled, unadulterated boredom. i knew nothing of it before i entered the dark room, took my seat. i was seduced by the "mysterious and suspenseful" blurb on the poster i suppose. also, lena headey is nice and unconventionally sexy, and richard jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around, so the cast seemed reasonable. it may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on. i should've gone to see valkyrie for the second time instead.the thin plot revolves around headley's gina mcvey, her boyfriend, her father, her sister and her sister's husband who for some reason are being stalked, in a very louche and unenthusiastic manner, by their evil doppelgangers who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash. there could be a great film behind this idea (not exactly an original idea, mind you, but still...) and in fact, if the filmmakers had shorn away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to headey's character's story, the broken could've made a reasonable 20-minute short. as it is, it is desperately unmotivated and boring, and terribly inconsistent.for instance, in one scene, a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters; they look puzzled but quickly forget about it. in another scene, a mirror smashes in an empty room, and a doppelganger is visible as she "steps out" of the shards left hanging on the wall. so why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out? just for a little thrill? there are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimly-lit london flats, peering around corners cos they thought they heard something, but seeing nothing there and moving on. we begin to wonder, why doesn't this malevolent doppelgang actually ever want to try to scare them? scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience. but we, the audience, will need to start threatening each other, in the darkness of the theater, if we want to have any thrills during the broken. by the way, once we've spent time with these evil doubles, we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them - they just stand around, blank looks on their faces, perhaps totally harmless after killing their others.there are some nice moods and touches throughout, and i dare say director sean ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time.

i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued. a woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car. well, i thought, this could be interesting......but it isn't. first, the title. the broken? the broken...what? what is broken? the...oh, wait...i get it, the title itself is "broken"! wow, clever! unfortunately, this is virtually the only thing going for it.the premise is not that bad, but i think kiefer suderland did much better in 'mirrors'. a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that. a more suited title would be 'the boring', since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages. or maybe 'the confusing' since it doesn't explain anything at all, not in the narrative nor in the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible. it's just messed up.on the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not a difficult role to act.after watching the movie twice, i still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the e. a. poe or stephen king kind of way. do yourself a favor, and don't watch this one. simply put, there are better thrillers out there.

having read many of the comments here, i'm surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called "mirror image," starring vera miles. rod serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze. a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. sadly, substance and sense are two things missing from "the broken." yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. some further observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the movie has a cellphone! and even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going, there is never any reference to an insurance company, to the person who was driving the other car, or to the police who would have been required to do a report. my advice: skip this bore and watch the original instead!

this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen. every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors - corey and danny are soo annoying. corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny's false promises.neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film. danny (dean paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to bed - corey looks as if she's still in college.here in australia, this film is called too smooth; there is nothing smooth about this film at all. 1/10 avoid

mr. mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so i was interested to see what he'd do with total creative control over a movie. sadly, it is unwatchable, though not because the jokes aren't funny--some (i won't say most) of them are, and in fact mr. mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. the trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so god-awful, the movie is intolerable. some outfit called "pko productions" gets the producing credit, but it doesn't look produced at all; it looks more like mike stole one of the cameras from the snl set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. i realize mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking. still, the dvd isn't a total waste: it includes a eulogy for o'donoghue by bill murray and three "mr. mike's least loved bedtime stories" from snl. plus, the "cat swimming" section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out. 3/10

i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out, since i was a huge snl fan. when my boyfriend and i went to see it, the people coming out of the early show were yelling, "don't waste your money!" but of course we had to find out for ourselves.while there were a few funny bits (laser bra 2000, root boy slim), most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show. it was pretty bad.when the opera singer came on, many people got up and walked out. this made me laugh, because i realized that o'donoghue was just pressing people's buttons on purpose with this movie. or else he was just insane. whatever - you don't need to waste your time watching it, it's that bad.

i actually saw this movie at a theater. as soon as i handed the cashier my money, she said two words i had never heard at a theater, before or since: "no refunds!" as soon as i heard those words, i should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. but no, foolishly, i went in and watched the movie. this movie didn't make anyone in the theater laugh. not even once. not even inadvertantly! mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "this movie sucks!" the audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes.

i saw this movie in 1979, i was 17 or 18, when it was released. the theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the movie started. ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater. the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back. we decided to stay for the entire movie.... why endure such torture??... here's why. we wanted to be true movie critics... to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie (a 10)they always come up with something better. but, it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made (and this is it... a 1 at best). there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1, but i have yet to see them. i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst....i am a true movie critic...he he.

it is a real shame that nearly no one under 30 knows the "over the top" writing of michael o'donoghugh- magazine articles and snl skits that were genius for the time...and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos- thus leading them to mr mikes mondo video. this movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone. the viewer experiences such things as cat diving/swimming with the man who thinks he's found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence. then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired (hula hops, pet rocks, rainbow dread wigs etc.) then we enter the music world (punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film) where "d" rate bar performer rootboy slim performs "boogie till you puke" in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze. now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music. in many different styles with many different instruments the sound of telstar plays and replays- for those who don't understand telstar was the first american satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph. mr mikes seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes. now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of sid vicious (ex sex pistol not the wrestler) singing my way. his version is very different than sinatras as one might imagine but frankly i feel it is very much worth the listen...it's good! that is the sad part- in the vhs release paul anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1/2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol. i would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is passé i can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2.5. if you want to see a good o'donoghugh script watch scrooged...it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent.

updating of the bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad-to-average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema-going set. (for the record, this list, all of the films on which appear to be attempting a castle-esque miracle, includes, strange bedfellows, thunderstruck, bad eggs, the honourable wally norman, horseplay, the wannabes and the nugget. the only one to have worked has been crackerjack.)here, the performances never mesh, as john howard doesn't even look like he's in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention, as franklin plays sleepy, conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants. 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on-screen, but this is hardly a reason to watch the film. in fact, the only reasons may well be (1) howard's bizarre  but quite fun  performance, and (2) the 'suburban nightmare' theme, which has run through somersault, strange bedfellows, tom white, alexandra's project, danny deckchair, the rage in placid lake, traveling light, teesh & trude, swimming upstream and lantana, many of which are very good/excellent. enter at own risk! may be one for people who titter at the word 'penis'. 4/10.

this one features all the (bad) effect of prior's cheap-o movies, but is so overtly racist, nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature. unless you plan to enlist in the marines, skip this one. oh, and even if you do, avoid it at all costs.

i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies, and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so i did go into this film with some hopes. however, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. as the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. that's basically all the plot that this movie has. the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. overall, the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.

i have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first.it was awful. i actually didn't watch the end of it. it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one (all soaps are crap). the actors were poor and storyline was bad. the person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is on about. the script was awful. 2 people was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no. he says "if you do that ... i will hurt you" hahahahaha. if comedy is your thing, watch away. please do not watch this film because ... it's crap!!! summary: poor acting, bad fights, bad script.don't watch! of course this is in my opinion.

absolute garbage, worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc.truly dire acting, not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures.watch it just for how truly bad this film is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s.if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector, those are proper martial arts films.have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is.

wow, i knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. spoilerific comments ensue.roddy roddy piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!), helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. his adopted son returns from armed forces "special ops" and because he's "seen things" - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son.oh, the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-army bloke. this happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene.the action could have saved this film, but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. it's all been done before, it's all been done much much better (ong-bak is a prime example). this is the worst film i've ever seen - and i've seen waterworld, twice.erm, the film is called honor (spelt wrong for the americans) and the tag line has "from the makers of bloodsport and kickboxer" - check out director david worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there, even though they are over 10 years old. such classics as "shark attack 3: megalodon" - says it all really.i'll give you £10 if you don't go to see this film.ps - apologise for not know character names, tells you something though.

there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie. the girlfriend and i both love action films. especially fight scenes (bloodsport and kickboxer was awesome), but this movie was not entertaining. five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and "angry" facial expressions. the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times. the army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique. the music isn't good either. they fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, 'cause these guys are thugs. the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas.everything about this movie is classic b-style. the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood alleyway. the film is called "honor," but there was no honor in making this film. it was simply a waste of money, and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorable.go see felon instead. the fight scenes and situations are more real.

this film has the look and feel of a student film project. yeah, there are some interesting (albeit gimmicky) edits and shots, but the end result was juvenile.the director didn't seem to be saying "look at this film." it seemed as if he were saying, "look at me! i'm a director!"thumbs down.

this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews. the limey is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful nightwatch with ewan macgregor and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti-talented jennifer lopez. terence stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story, filming and just plain common sense. this film does everything wrong. what were they thinking?

the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine. the article made this film look interesting. well, it isn't. this was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. all the actors in this movie are awful, except faye dunaway, who is always a joy to watch. but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio. marzio has such a thick argentinean accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says. also on hand is nicholas pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest to gina phillips. the bottom line: this movie is not scary. there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. i would have given this one star, but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much. but even she wasn't that great in this.

for some reason, tv guide gave this two and a half stars, plus faye dunaway is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. my, oh, my, this may be the worst film i've ever seen. ever. from its horrid acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, i shouted to the tv "i can't act!" when she asks what he needs, i yell "i need acting lessons!" to the unbelievably bad dialog ("give me back my organs!").and the brian depalma wannabe ending, too, it was all just beyond awful. i wanted to like it. dunaway is one of the best actors ever. and the production values were pretty good.but wowzers, this had me laughing, laughing!, most of the time.don't even bother out of curiosity, that was my first mistake. staying with it was definitely my second, and third and fourth.

...cause they're both pretty lousy. i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs. she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture, rip someone to bloody pieces, and calmly re-enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened. now, you know a movie's in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention.i admit, i paid $30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie. i know what you're thinking--30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole. and you would be absolutely correct. this movie sucks. there, it's right out in the open. i was expecting some actual scares, and i waited and waited and waited. none came. the raven (probably a crow in makeup) didn't scare me, seeing small pieces of internal organs didn't scare me, and even faye didn't scare me. i'm not that brave, i know, so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble. what's more, jennifer wasn't scared either. her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything. her life was rapidly coming to a close and she's worried about attaining more money. honey, you can't take money where you're going!!! "i need money," she continually says, completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function.meanwhile, i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother (faye). i was suspicious at first, faye playing a grandmother and all, and i was still suspicious at the end. there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother-from-hell are forced to share temporarily, and i'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother. here's the weird part--the relative looks like she's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party. mary ellen looks like she's just gotten a face-lift from a renowned surgeon. face-lifts can't work miracles, but i think faye's appearance is important to the rice-paper plot. spoiler!!! it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting...sorry, my little joke. seriously though, there's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate. yuck, huh? interestingly enough, mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact. how did she avoid the family curse? something's up with her, obviously.another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars--this movie features one of my all-time movie pet peeves. i refer to the double ending. this movie ends twice. i absolutely hate it when that happens, and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending, didn't like it, and forget to remove it during editing. i guess it's supposed to be scary, but it is only if you're a film editor.there is one perk to this debacle, though, and it's one of the reasons i bought the dvd. the "filmmaker" commentary features faye dunaway, and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn't have lines to recite. guess what--the movie sucked so bad i wasn't able to sit through it again. drat.

don't bother. a little prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from dunaway. the plot is one of those bumper car episodes... the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again, until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot. gina phillips is actually good, but it's hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx's brother's duck soup. ah, the raven...now there's an actor. and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. or dr. dread who's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies. i'm one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end. quoth the raven, "nevermore."

oh this was a really bad movie. the girl who plays jennifer is ok, but i think she acts bitchy through the movie, not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night, but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap. faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly. i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe, i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work(ravens, house of usher-like family curse,and being buried alive)-still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film.

this movie was a littttle confusing at first. i usually like gina phillips, but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the rosie, that one also not one her good movies. jeepers creepers was way better. anyway, faye dunaway was good. she totally creeped me out and at the end, that was crazy. it was about jennifer cassi(phillips) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. she stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(dunaway) lives at with an aunt named emma. mary ellen(dunaway) is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can't die. even if jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries. ravens have a weird part in it. when the relations go to sleep, the ravens eat there organs, so they can't go to sleep. but they do. basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die and her relations will be buried, but not dead, b/c they have to suffer forever so mary ellen can stay alive. yeah, i hope this helps. if it doesn't, sorry. love ya.

jennifer's shadow is set in argentina & starts as jennifer cassi (gina philips) arrives there after her sister johanna dies. jennifer is left johanna's large house in her will, jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen (faye dunaway) is opposed to the sale. however strange things begin to happen, jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill. after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared, what is happening to jennifer? is it an ancient family curse? will jennifer be the next to succumb to it...this argentinian american co-production was co-written & co-directed by daniel de la vega & pablo parés & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them. the script by vega, parés & p.j. pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants, i mean i'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls. the character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? how did he know about the demons? what is his interest & motivation for getting involved? i couldn't see it. jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady, her grandmother mary allen is as clichéd as they come & it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain. i mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine. there are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist i didn't like jennifer's shadow one iota.directors vega & parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white, i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it's been done so many times before & often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless. there's a definite 40's period look as well, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted & cheap looking. jennifer's shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable. if that wasn't enough there's no gore either, there's a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else.with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 & retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it's us & international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days & jennifer's shadow pretty much proves that theory. there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well, even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying. the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money.jennifer's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish, i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies!!? (1964) again instead. a total waste of time.

jennifer cassi (gina philips from "dead and breakfast") returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (fay dunaway) who's still living in it. jennifer decides to sell it as she's in dire need of the money much to granny's chagrin. she also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. there was really no one to relate to in this film. jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental, and narcissistic, whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful, sad, and also narcissistic. the film is good and well-made, but with no one to empathize with i found it hard to care about what happened to them.my grade: c-

this is easily the most disappointing, least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre, which, by the way, are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home. rather than being "exploitation" or demeaning, these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era. well, not bucktown.in this story, duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother. he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force, bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses. duke resists, and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police. unfortunately, he does so by calling in a posse of his friends (these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with duke on "jobs" in the past) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood. and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it. ignorance is not a justification for murder, and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street. while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre, it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family, cuss them out, give them a jujitsu ass-kickin' and set their 'fro on fire. that has art (and a reason for existing) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back. of course, in this bizarre tale, she is playing a woman completely under the man's thumb, afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people. indeed, her advice to duke is, "run, man, they gonna kill you!"following the sickening and gratuitous violence, we are expected to believe that the town's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends, congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor, as opposed to, say, calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody. duke's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree. they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors (to quote the mayor, "they are ten times worse than what we had before!"). now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt, protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets. unfortunately, duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero, as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force. i wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point. i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons, but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence, duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police. duke is a pig.finally, when everyone in town but duke, aretha, and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin' in the street, our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they don't. duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice. if you are interested in this genre of film, by all means, i highly recommend them, see coffy, foxy brown, truck turner, blacula, sheba babybut if in the process you should run across this dvd, throw it as far away as you possibly can! drop it like it's hot! it should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste! there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining, satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime, obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores.

this movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny.the underlying message i got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man. every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is being lazy, being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men.but, it is a comedy, and a piece of art, so it is simply someones point of view. even if i don't agree with it, they are still entitled to it.an amusing film, but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid. best film ever my foot.

with a movie called "gayniggers from outer space" how could you go wrong? just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the village people as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. plot is unimportant. too bad, this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot. the characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails.the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film. my expectation were to high apparently.

well, what can i say about this movie. i'm speechless. i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that really pi*sed me off was the music. and to top it all off someone commented on how much they liked it. to them all i have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time fistsof fury starring bruce lee. if he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. i say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film.i now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it. the only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity. what is this world coming to.

this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth, in order to create a gay universe.i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was. still, i was shocked at how bad it was. it looked more like a film made 50 years ago. the acting, if any, is ultra bad. the sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making any college film look mega budget. and the special effects are laughably simple, indeed jaw dropping as others have commented, but jaw droppingly embarrassing.one has to be severely intoxicated, or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film. if i was from denmark, i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film.

it's hard to know what was going through per kristensen and morten lindberg's heads when they wrote "gayniggers from outer space" - the movie is billed as a comedy, yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names (capt. b. dick, sgt. shaved balls). the rest of the movie is a (presumably) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-overs (with the 'actors' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling), 'futuristic' computer displays filled with spelling mistakes, and a plot that makes almost no sense.even though 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good film is. it may be entertaining to watch with some friends, but this film only deserves about a '2' out of ten...slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie.

gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth. being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. hence, when they discover women or "female creatures" live on earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.an offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. however, there's little substance underneath. as another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. arminass); i think i laughed once at one small gay joke. i think i got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that i had had enough; i kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!). not brilliant or particularly well-written.

i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. but, no, that's really what it was. and since the film was only about 27 minutes long, i decided to give it a try. if it had turned out to be some porno movie, i would have stopped watching. instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen. the danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a star trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the earth! and in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.subtle, this ain't. with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i've ever heard, i don't even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed! however, despite the utter crappiness of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. but, as i mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. by the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to who would make this, why make it and who was the intended audience?! it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!

gayniggers from outer space is pretty much summed up by its name. running only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to earth to free the men from women. while i see a little significance to the plot, it also is really illogical. granted, its meant to be a comedy/spoof on society and science fiction. i found myself laughing several times, so it succeeds there.the special effects are horrible. when the spaceship is floating above the earth, you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason. the asteroids shown in the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are messed up; in general, the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously. if you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, its very accessible and easy to see through to the end. some parts are hilarious. but overall, the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever.seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects, its not the worst thing to see. but its illogical and holds little long-term value. i can't really recommend it; if you do watch it, do so for the unique concept, not the quality.

i really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. the acting was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, sooo slowwwwww. the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end. twenty minuets into a films and i'm praying for an ending. sure some of the visuals were nice, but c'mon guys, i mean really! and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of. the music there was was annoying, and boring. there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too, those were also annoying. mainly this film managed to bore me, and creep me out at the same time.i'm glad its over. i need to go see "tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.

when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. i'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage. however, the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed. although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent. the visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece. however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered over the head with. most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. it seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. the voice overs from felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing (and even that wasn't properly addressed). i'm afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a 'reasonable first attempt', by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading dh lawrence. not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all.

the brothers quay are directors, judging by conventional thought, should have stuck to making short films. i myself actually really liked their first feature, institute benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore effort, the piano tuner of earthquakes, i'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length. piano tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous film to look at, and often to listen to. unfortunately, it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace. reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life. one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. my god, it's awful here. a huge bust.

the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, poised to flick around to watch something else. the premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space "bin" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.the introduction of the character, played by joe pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes. and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, whithnail & i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.however, for my money, the actors save tinseltown from the "terrible movie" archives and just about nudges it into the "could have been a cult movie" archives. i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantoliano's character. in particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything.unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.

a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (tom wood and arye gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (ron perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the "costume killer" (so named because, after injecting his victims with windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (john considine, joe pantoliano, kristy swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.if you're a ron perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into jerry lewis mode). he's just simply fun to watch in this one. david dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role.

sorry, i just didn't find the subject matter as compelling as the filmmaker did. the robot guy and the mole rat guy were pretty interesting, although morris didn't really tell us much about them. the other two subjects were a bore. and the supposed "connections" between them didn't hold up.

i found the documentary entitled fast, cheap, and out of control to be a fairly interesting documentary. the documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. each one of these men was extremely involved with his job, showing sheer love and enjoyment for one's job.the sad part, i must say, would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked/studied. they were interesting for about five minutes, afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long.the video was filmed in a very creative way though. i very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. it played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.

so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless. i know it got awards and things, but i personally did not enjoy it too much. there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some of the people in are rather different which isn't a bad thing, it just didn't leave a good impression on me. i was thoroughly bored by this movie, no offense to my creative writing teacher. the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn't get it, and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing. the green animals thing was neat, i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs connect? it just didn't make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that. but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it. who am i to stand in your way. i am just forewarning you about possible suffering.

this makes the third errol morris movie i've seen, and i'm increasingly not liking his style. he seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about. it's never really a direct caricaturation of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying, "but no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their back.this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation... a man who studies african hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. the general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? so the title of fast, cheap, & out of control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie... right? except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them "obsessions") making synthetic designs on life. i share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the film.but i stress his subtlety. with no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head. instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the ants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about. i don't find them absurd, i find them all very neat and interesting individuals.unless, of course, he didn't intend such juxtapositions, which means he's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter. considering none of this films i've seen so far have particularly impressed me, i don't really care to find out what he's trying to do.--polarisdib

personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie. it's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed. slow and not very convincing. if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentary.but in any case, since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching. i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to.overall, when it comes to movies, i have one golden rule: avoid any films that contains the word 'ninja'.

i only watched this film from beginning to end because i promised a friend i would. it lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have. it may be the worst film i have ever seen. i'm surprised a distributor put their name on it.

this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie. the story is wrong and a complete lie. there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy. it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry. the marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. unfortunately for these communist nut jobs, ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him, thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts.never, ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen. mccarthy. read ann coulter's book, "treason" for a better look at the truth about sen. mccarthy.it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm

i still can't believe this movie. they got so much unbelievable things in it, that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it.the story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story at all. how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, town conspiracies, sex-jokes and a fbi-agent? you can't.beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors. i watched this film and thought: 'is this really marlon brando? no, it can't be. (5 minutes later) is this charlie sheen? wow, maybe brando is true. (5 minutes later) this can't be donald sutherland. (5 minutes later) no, not mira sorvino. this movie is too bad for all of them. (at the end). no, no, no, this can't absolutely not be martin sheen!!! not for 10 seconds of such a movie.' then it was over and i down with my nerves. so many good, oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, dumb, awful movie. i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one. they couldn't got so much money.only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie.3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)

it's a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i'd hate to think of him going out on free money. not what his fans ought to remember him by.brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for financing of his own work. brando is the warden of a local prison which in america, when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area. that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout. unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges, his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters. even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers, charlie sheen and thomas haden church, their hearts still belong to daddy.not to fear because brando's willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have. what to do, but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the treasury. although free money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved. some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight arrow fbi agent.of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century. were it not for brando's presence and were it some 40 years earlier, free money would be playing the drive-in circuit in red state america where the populace could see how they're being satirized.or a feeble attempt is made to satirize them.

my girlfriend picked this one; as a southern born and raised african american i found this movie's plot and premise totally without credibility. to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south. totally absurd !!! i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell (who being southern knows better) to participate in this crap

"shadrach" was not my favorite type of movie. i found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par. harvey keitel and andie macdowell were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable. i also did not believe that paul's parents would go away and leave him with the dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home. their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable. it seemed the dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. there was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed andie macdowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. who was it? her son? what was the scene supposed to show us? why was the scene even included? it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again. it seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all. there were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me. the story concerning shadrach was nice but i wasn't convinced that the dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed.

bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida. where he meets a little penquin, which he tries to save from an eskimo. this short tries and the penquin is adorable, but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughs department. the eskimo isn't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly, even other shorts when he's paired with other unknown antagonists. so i can't in good conscience recommend this one. however it is nice to see it in it's uncut form. this cartoon is on disk 3 of the "looney tunes golden collection volume 1" my grade: c

this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date, the best part was christian j. meoli "leonard" attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar, kind-of like i wanted to do on the dvd, to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film. it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good, i mean with sean astin "andrew" (played his part perfectly, did a great job, too bad it was in this film), kyra sedgwick "bevan", ron livingston "chad", renée zellweger "poet" (they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie...if the cast had any dignity, they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer / director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom

this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood. bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of "deewar" and "on the waterfront" will bring home an oscar. it turned out to be rookie mistake.even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic. in the original, brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace.bollywood must move out of hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.

i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. and i have to say, it did not deserve it.parinda was so hyped, that i was really looking forward to watch it.parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film-makers, despite having a great story. it was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "on the waterfront".anil kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from america. the direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.give this script to any of them - ram gopal verma, deepa mehta, mahesh bhatt, sudhir mishra, and i'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.i'm not saying parinda was bad. it was just not good enough.

i went into this movie hoping for the best. i like wartime musicals in general. dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. the love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. i did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with "der fuhrer's face." the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. bert lahr's comedy skits were interminable.there were parts to enjoy: lucille ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.

it's curious that the two stars of meet the people were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. lucille ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. as for dick powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like meet the people and his career salvation would be coming in his next film.i think the only reason that dick powell did the film was because a young player from mgm was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time. his private time with june allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. powell looks crashingly bored and can't summon up any kind of emotion at all.he was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind he ran from warner brothers from. the original show meet the people was not a book show, it was a revue and it ran in the 1940-41 season on broadway for 160 performances. when mgm bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song. the rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. odd when you consider some of the source material is from burton lane, e.y. harburg, harold arlen, and rodgers&hart. these guys just must have emptied the trunk for material.the plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. powell is the writer of a revue called meet the people and he's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star lucille ball. she's interested, he's interested, they're both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale. that's the film in a nutshell.mgm did give powell and ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching meet the people. the big bands of vaughn monroe and spike jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is bert lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like lou costello had in the dream sequence in in the navy. the song heave ho is written by arlen and harburg who wrote for lahr, the courage number from the wizard of oz. and as just about everyone in the world has seen that film, you have an idea of heave ho is like.dick powell's next film was murder my sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals. and lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do.

max had the v-8, trace (wheels of fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland. be amazed as mad max 2 (aka the road warrior) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.why is wof set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? simple, the road warrior was! actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the road warrior! except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non-vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.in typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion. inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them. along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film. generally i waited for trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated. badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker. the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.rats: nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior. and that in and of itself is saying a lot! by this count 2020 texas gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire. a poor road warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.

i've never found charley chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of john cleese, whom i find very funny. (charley chase also reminds me of gowky hen broon from scotland's 'sunday post' comics page.) in chase's best films, i tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him. i'll give chase credit that his very best films -- such as 'mighty like a moose' and 'his wooden wedding' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but i'm positive that even the most die-hard chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'married to order' just isn't funny at all.chase -- eager, awkward, gormless, naff -- is a young swain hoping to court the fair rose. oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who disdains chase as a 'mollycoddle'. leo white, who did more notable work as a foil for chaplin at essanay, is on hand here as a rival.there's some action involving an ingersoll watch. i was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product-placement? sadly, a major flaw in 'married to order' is the casting of rosemary theby as rose: she's meant to be a standard-issue ingenue, but theby -- flat-chested, hawk-faced -- is physically wrong for the role. theby (the wife of harry myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but was never a believable ingenue. film historian william k everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books.i'll rate 'married to order' just 3 out of 10, and i'm being charitable ... because i keep suspecting that charley chase has got something that everyone else gets but i keep missing.

while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny, in this film he certainly is. it's a shame, as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy? are very good chase films, so he could be really funny given good material. unfortunately, in this film he's given absolutely nothing. even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. it's a shame, as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't.by the way, for those used to the look for charley from the mid-1920s on, you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect.

in my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from "only the brave" to "all about lane". i went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. although, i appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. the performances of marc dacascos, tamlyn tomita, and jason scott lee were all great. however, the director should have never put himself as the main character in the movie. sorry lane, you are just not a film actor. stick to what you're good at - theater acting. gina hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. she should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a miss nisei queen. there were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... why weren't they cast for that role? another major problem with this film were its action sequences. the japanese-american soldiers don't look like they were fighting german soldiers... let alone anyone. granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some actually fighting? this film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a major distribution.

yowza! if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! this movie, while a great attempt at 'imitating' laurel and hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a movie of any substance. i blame larry harmon. dialogue is torn from old l+h movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars, pinchot's accent was bizarre for stan, and while sartain did an excellent job with ollie's accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr. hardy. where was a (good) musical number? editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. it's even more painful to watch than atoll k, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can, and learn how things were. you know what a magnate is, don't you? stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update/honor of the boys. where was the classic theme song?!? why ruin 'here's another fine mess'? why skip 'any the wiser'? why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! why miss gulch from the wizard of oz???? why must larry harmon be in it? why bozo!? and did the learning channel help fund the thing?i mean, really. fart jokes, for god's sake.fart jokes.

i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle 're-enactment', but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l & h. bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there's a reasonably good supporting cast. i enjoyed it.

for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. the plot is tired, the acting is strained, the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the "f" word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so 'let's throw in another couple of "f's" for good measure, that's what the american public wants to hear'. gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part. forget this c__p, rent 'shrek" and have a good laugh.

"jason priestly stars as 'breakfast', a psychotic jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is frighteningly precarious, according to the dvd sleeve, "with his accomplice 'panda' (bernie coulson), the duo make off with a carload of cash, a result of a tip-off from beautiful cashier 'ziggy' (laura harris). her reward: to hitch a ride with the out-of-control duo so that she can meet her long-lost father francis (stephen mchattie). but he's on a suicidal quest to even a score with his former boss (louis gossett, jr.) and has the cops hot on his trail. rage, murder and revenge are about to collide!" stay out of their way!*** the highwayman (4/28/00) keoni waxman ~ jason priestly, laura harris, stephen mchattie

the first one was the best. the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible. although, the storyline wasn't so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). throughout the movie, i dosed off a few times. i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in rush hour 2. chris tucker, too, wasn't good. and zhang ziyi, what can i say, a few lines, terrible acting (but that's based on her script). all the characters there were not that good. but, some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him.

designed only to annoy (or amuse) any self-respecting intelligent person. if the director's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character, then it would have been okay, but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who'd make a critique of america's pro-marxist 60s movement, especially not a filmmaker from the 70s. there is so much idiotic dialog going on here, that sometimes i wondered if i wasn't actually watching a comedy. you wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  that's how naïve the movie appears. spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious, inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons. but, i mean, aren't they all? nice boobs, but s**t for brains.

please don't hate me but i have to be honest, watching this movie, i had a lot of fun,,it's a movie with a stupid cast and stupid songs!!!unnecessary songs!!! mehbooba... a total insult to the original one holi.... well.. it was ok! due to the tradition every movie got to have one!! chad raha hai nasha whatever... very unneeded stupid song jee le... sounded like a playboy song stupid song...other than songs. the movie was ok this was ram gopal verma's own adaptation... if you think like that you will like this moviewell this movie only depends on the viewer and on his judgement whether he/she thinks this movie is total copy he/she would want to hit her head on the cinema seat or if he/she thinks of the directors own look he/she would be relaxed and take a look at this movieanyways i looked at both ways i would congratulate and abuse ram gopal for this disaster that he made...well some other things that bothered that the cast was incredibly badamitabh bachchan as babban/gabbar (amitabh in his own movie remake funny what was the director thinking) ajay devgan as heero/veeru(bobby deol could have been better) prashant raj as raj/jai(abhishek was meant for this role despite doing a special appearance in the mehbooba song) sushmita sen as radha/durga(jaya bachchan was right tabu was right for this role) nisha kothari as ghungroo/basanti(i think esha deol would have been great) mohanlal as narishma/thakur(mohanlal is so cute....oops sorry hehehehe, he was ok i could not think of anyone)the movie would have even faired a little if the cast was oki movie wasn't even exciting, the movie was just ok , just for watchingthe overall ratingdirection... 8/10 i got to him some credit cinematography... 9/10 script... 3/10 bad scripting songs... 5/10 unnecessary in the movie, could have been better, easy on the ears on to be played in pc's and ipod's and stuff cast... 1/10total ... 3/10syed shabbir aly naqvi from pakistan

not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh - try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case. the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj. nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. as for prashant raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. ajay devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, rgv's aag is worth watching for amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance.

its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there. a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do.biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed. actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time-pass of songs. and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have

i cannot say that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made, because i haven't seen every bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that it could well be.this film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission. no a-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.but lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award. there is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene. the lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. and, of course the actors! some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. the ensemble of actors in aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of india's most loved movie of all time, 'sholay'. one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are a-list and willing participants to something that, let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation??? so it begs the question, amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original? did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film? don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.i truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original.

this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop. ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie "sholay", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew. waste of money, waste of time. after making movies like rangeela, satya, and company he pulled a coppola (godfather) on us; what were you thinking rgv? anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the old sholay. ajay devgan playing heero (beeru, sholay) and ajay, new kid on the block playing ajay (jay,sholay). both "bad yet funny" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. later in the movie, now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan. in case you haven't been watching bollywood movies, the good guys win in the end. there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!

in a variant of sholay , ram gopal verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape. the thakur goes south.mohanlal as narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance madrasi style. the accent is totally south indian in contrast to thakur from the north. the severing of the hands of thakur by gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in aag. so make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered kurta covers up for the cut fingers. moreso in the climax where the thakur uses his legs and says"tere liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai" here narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain. babban, the new avtar of gabbar is also different. he is not from bihar or up. he is bambaiya. gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued. babban asks for diwali instead of holi and romances urmila the replacement of helen in mehbooba. he also dances and enjoys dancing with abhisheh who plays jalal agha in mehbooba.babban is more intelligent this time. he tosses the apple and asks the question that made isaac newton discover laws of gravitation. basanti is more verbose than the auto driver ghungroo. nisha kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like 'entertain' and 'too much' with gay abandon. viru was fun whereas ajay devgun is a misfit for the role. the god speaks to basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the koi haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful. the water tank turns into a well and the drunk devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide. jai was composed and serious. prashant raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him. but he also bungles on the mausi sequence. he is not as romantic as jai with the mouth organ . jaya's role played by sushmita changes careers. a pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed. she too lacks the pain that jaya displayed. her flirtations with jai are more open this time. samba gets a bigger role this time as tambe. he does not have to point guns and answer questions of gabbar this time. he follows babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den. horses give way to jeeps and auto. the gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and ramgarh becomes kaliganj. all in all it is more of a spoof than anything else. rgv comes up with his own interpretation of the classic. but we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues. so we call it a spoof. so mr.rgv(sholay ) and farhan akhtar (don) and jpdutta(umrao jaan) stop making remixes and start making originals.

i downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good! i was watching the movie with high expectations (though i knew it was a flop), especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain.i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles.but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete amjad khan's magic rgv's trial to re-kindle the past backfired royally! sholay, the old one is a milestone in indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.a good actor like ajay devgan's talents are wasted and his performance was average.prashant raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is . nisha kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in rgv's crew urmila & abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion mohanlal tried his best and susmitha sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay

iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.ram gopal varma ki aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real sholay. it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . there is no camaraderie between heero(ajay devgan) and raj(prashant raj). there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is remarkable. amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie. ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. rajpal yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. rest of the cast was below expectation. the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.ram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this aag. but there is no fire.

sholay: considered to be one of the greatest films. i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is. that was the time rgv announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it. i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie, but every week we would here rgv change something. and the movie is a very b-grade movie, something that i had not hoped.i really tried looking for positives, but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind. the cinematography is awesome. the movie tries to be its own. but that is the up side. the action sequences are weak. the screenplay had potential. the biggest flaw is editing. none of the scenes excite you. for example, the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced. ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original. and none of the characters are developed. and no scenes will linger until the end. and the ending was very disappointing.the biggest question is acting. amitabh bachchan was good as gabbar singh, nothing great. it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look, that the character only looks menacing, but you don't get creeped out. mohanlal is barely in the movie, but he impresses in his few scenes. ajay devgan was decent. it wasn't so much the performance, he gave it his all, it was the weak script. prashant raj is very confident, and has potential to make it far with better movies.i had most expectations for sushmita sen, who was probably the best of the lot. she was expressive, but this still was not enough. nisha kothari surprised me. she seemed disinterested for the most part, but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good. seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent, not her cute looks. but what disappointed me most was chemistry. ajay devgan and prashant raj didn't look like friends. ajay-nisha were not a strong couple. no passion was to be found between sushmita and prashant. and amitabh and mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed.as for songs, they pretty much suck. urmila's mehbooba was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it. it was however nicely danced. the holi number was enjoyable, but not memorable. same went for the other songs. for someone who looked forward to this movie, i was heavily disappointed. i had high hopes for rgv because of his jungle, but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie. but hopefully he regains his talent for sarkar raj. but this movie is best forgotten. all the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is.

once in a while in indian cinema there comes along a movie like sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. and den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a rgv ki aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. a standard so low, it can never be broken. ram gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. to take a classic like sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and i can't believe he almost called the movie rgv ki sholay. although sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. what aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst. the realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of "actors" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. one star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for rgv to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another "different" plot that can be categorized under cinema.

i must tell you right up front, i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful. however, if you've never seen one, don't start with this one! i have greatly enjoyed the ones i've seen up until this one, but i just couldn't stand this one. i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this film--it was that annoying. so why was it so annoying? 1. there is a character named 'rambha' in the film. he is even more annoying than jar-jar binks--which i never would have believed would have been possible. he is so #@^!# annoying!! he spoke in a falsetto voice and i think was meant to be comic relief. instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! his voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! 2. the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge ak-47 bullets with ease. i kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! and, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the ruffians!!! this made stallone's actions in "rambo ii" look mundane!! 3. the film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.4. the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! perhaps if you are the most ardent action and bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me i can see why it's on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list. wow...this film is bad and intensely bad!!

truly shows that hype is not everything. shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife. amitabh as always is solid. ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke. the leading lady is such a waste of an actor. such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry. with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i watch.rgv has been making very crappy movies for a while now. time to get different actors. hrithek anyone? bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back. every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be. pffffft.

overall performance :- at last the long waiting aag hits the screens. unfortunately, it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience. the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay. and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this. different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. right from the start of his career with siva in telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather. it's all dutch dutch dutch dutch. why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! the shot division is lame. characters couldn't carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, storytelling is worse, background is really really terrible.babban:- amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. varma produced great villains like bikumatre, bhavtakur das, mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema. there's no comparison of gabbar with babban. babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother ( it's a gift in this movie). amitabhz performance is not to his mark. his appearance itself is pathetic. the scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. what ever they worked on babban is not successful. babban is no comparison with gabbar.narsimha:- the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. if varma did that , it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder. itz good he opened the secret early. but the flashback is pathetic. varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.durga:- the only character with betterment. this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.heroo, raj, ghunguroo:- no body bothers or at least considers these character. the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. these characters carry nothing to this movie.ramgopalvarma:- his quality is degrading, diminishing. aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie. sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra. aag never carried an emotion with its characters. storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. don't compare aag with sholay, still u will not like it.if you dare watch this movie. you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema!! could not wait for it to end. to make matters worse it is given a 12a certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even babban getting killed was cut out!!! too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as i think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!! amitabhs acting was great but that 'basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays devgans mate can't even act. devgan was wasted!!i would not watch this for free again and i advise all others who read this to do just the same you have been warned!!

i can't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror i felt sitting in that cinema watching ramgopal varma ki aag, the director's half-hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic bollywood western, sholay. the biggest problem with varma's remake is that he doesn't even try to make a credible film. it's evident in every single frame of this movie that varma's heart is just not in it. what you see on screen is a bad joke at best, a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker, and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he's been a fan of all his life.i've seen several bad films over the years, but i can't remember one that's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one. consider yourself very brave if you're able to survive the entire film, because it tests your patience like few films have before.varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film, but his version is trite and hollow and doesn't have any of the spirit and energy of sholay. ramgopal varma ki aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not - way-over-the-top, too-long-too-boring, and entirely mindless. much-loved moments from sholay are parodied by varma and for that you want to wring his neck. one of the most memorable scenes in sholay in which dharmendra as veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with ajay devgan playing hero, pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself. how you wish he'd pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony.not only does ramgopal varma ki aag fail as a remake of sholay, it's a pretty bad effort even as a stand-alone film. the eardrum-damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen, and the camera-work alternates between dramatic and head-spinning. partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film's mostly dead-as-wood actors. sushmita sen as devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously, punctuating her lines with pauses, staring into camera for effect, and generally performing like her life depends upon it. mohanlal as narsimha, struggles with his hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career. newcomer prashant raj playing jai-equivalent raj has no acting chops to speak of and can't strum up any of the brooding intensity amitabh bachchan brought to the part in the original film.as hero, the new-age veeru, ajay devgan is entirely hopeless, failing miserably in his attempts at comedy. but the film's weakest link, easily the most shocking casting decision is nisha kothari as ghunghroo, who steps into the shoes of hema malini as basanti, the endearing airhead from sholay. nisha kothari is not only the worst actress in this country, but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world, she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning, and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she's on screen. and then, there is amitabh bachchan playing babban singh, ramgopal varma's version of hindi cinema's most popular villain gabbar singh. the only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film's over-the-top tone and plays along accordingly, bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch. he's meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams, and he does all of that to good effect. but because he's trapped in such a doomed enterprise, his performance doesn't really help elevate the film in any way.no surprises here, i'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for ramgopal varma ki aag, it one's of those painful movie-watching experiences you wouldn't subject even an enemy to. it's not like varma hasn't handled a remake before. with sarkar he gave us a smart, gripping take on the godfather, and it's a pity he's made this sholay bhature out of such a much-loved classic. ramgopal varma ki aag is his worst career decision ever, it's also a dark spot on his resume he'll be embarrassed of forever. i suspect this film will go down in movie history as ramgopal varma ka daag.

something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot. the movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making. the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake.the editing is poor. direction is crap. acting is out of this world(omg)! the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes.i wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.

i, like many other bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay. this movie was not it. thank god they didn't let them use the name "sholay" in the movie title. ram gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. the camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen. you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. the only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash? save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out.

first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). the film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting. 1) to start with, the name of the movie is really c class (though the movie itself match up to the name). 2) amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) in sholay gabbar singh has reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). here in aag the figure was 100 crores for babban (amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute (with all automatic guns). making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing. 4) as for nisha kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting. why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again ? 5) mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) legendry role played by lila misra (mausi of basanti) in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy. ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag. 8) should not say anything about modern jai and veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.to summarize, i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic. please don't waste money and time on this movie. i think watching aap ka surror (which i thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable direction.thanks, saurabh

this film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap! i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. what was he trying to do? be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black? ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. what was amitabh doing? he's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i'm telling you he's already past half his way. i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh. i never really liked him because he thinks he's god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie. if you want to save your £17.75 and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts!

this is the first time i'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb. but i had to write it for this one. its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture. from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad. the acting is pathetic. i'm a big fan of ajay devgan (loved him in bhagat singh) but he is at his worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant raj is a non actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari. i have no clue why the director took her in this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work. please don't watch it

i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring. i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled "sholay". the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle. amithab bachan's acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure. nobody did justice to their work, including ajay devagan. this film don't deserve any audiences. i bet that this film will flop. "finally this movie sucks"

what's happening to rgv? he seems to repeat himself in every movie. has he run out of creative ideas? if he has, time to take a back seat. went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did i imagine it would be anywhere near the original. i knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. but even then i thought it would be a great rgv treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed sathya and company? or is he? i have my doubts after watching aag. i am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! so veeru becomes heero (how corny is that?), guess heeru wouldn't sound that great. ajay devgan is quite a disaster as heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in company sounds fake. the chemistry between heero and gunghroo (nisha kothari) doesn't exists at all. in fact the more charming nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. this reaches a peak by the end. raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as babban, he looks like a caricature of gabbar singh. there is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. the only performance that really stood out was mohan lal as inspector narasimha. i am afraid i don't have the patience to write more.

if the scale went negative i would be happier. seeing sushmita sen was nice, and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story. the choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story. oh, if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head, first. the film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like "seven samurai" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the "townsfolk" finally find their backbone and want to help. this movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this film - it was bad - probably the food from the caterer was bad too. i have never in 6 years of watching indian (bollywood) movies seen something this badly made.

what starts out as a gentle country yarn, inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister, as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western.an amiable rancher (norton) wanders into town and charms a young girl (evan rachel wood), seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance, but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye.edward norton  a real chameleon actor (with changing facial hair to match) playing a country hick, accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent. he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan. however, with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from, and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused. evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton.down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace, and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain. should we like this drifter or not? even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear. this ambiguity is to the film's detriment, as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch-potch. had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film, but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess. fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone. completist fans of norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley), give this a miss.

ok, the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one. anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some...) - the execution is everything.this is what bothered me with this flick. and it did bother me immensely. the rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the climax expected. we have seen those frigging highways five, six, seven times - why? norton character's troubles were seen as a childish game, not enough deep to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him. is he a coward, a manipulator or just a loony? references to the "taxi driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick (or to e.n. for that matter).and imho, it is cowardly executed at the end. cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in mid america. this guy should have killed the kid, blamed the father, create a real havoc. or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc., but no, we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony, the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony, of course, dies. the happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed, safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop-corns, undisturbed.and that scene where the loony enters the movie, oh my god, i would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that! you do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying. again, if you're a 16 years old girl somewhere in kansas nowhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age, ok, then you might enjoy this movie and its "message".

i really wanted to like this film, but the story is ridicules. i don't want to spoil this film, - don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together. the cowboy and "twig" ride up the ridge. the cowboy has a handle bar mustache. the cowboy and "twig" get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge. the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film. sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave, in dark, on the back of a horse.to be fair, the acting by the four main characters is solid.

was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of ed norton's facial hair. without revealing any plot details--on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place. it was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard. later on, in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven. this was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn't be an option. these continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had. also, i found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of de niro in taxi driver. even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer.

the longer this film went on-and it seemed to tediously go on for ever- the more annoyed i became, as quite frankly, what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense. how on earth do people get to make films like this,or indeed receive finance for such rubbish? don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time. and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns, so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold. america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal 'gun culture'. anyhow:the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl.he comes across a family with two spoiled brat children, a teenage girl and boy; taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope. the cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice-versa, and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser.the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression.a total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living, and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally.ask yourself:who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish, or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash?!this film is pointless drivel.it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music:2/10.

i saw this film in my cinema class. i am glad that i did not pay to see it. i came into it with an open mind, and was even a little excited. i really enjoy ed norton and evan rachel wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. i just never connected with this movie. the acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the storyline, or rather, lack thereof, was a problem. there was no central, connecting theme to the movie. was it a romance between norton and wood? well, no, not really. was it a western? kind of, but no. i'm all for twists in movies, i recently saw "brick" and loved it, but the place that this movie went was just too out there. it was so weird, and if i weren't required to have sat through the whole film, i would have walked out. the writing wasn't terrible, but it was just all over the place. by the time this movie ended, i was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner. there was just something about this film that didn't resonate, i understand more offbeat films like "fight club", but i just did not care about the characters at all.

this film really got off to a great start. it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending, romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "harlan" and tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. it really didn't need to be anything more than that, and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake, another timeless classic, a modern myth perhaps. why, oh why, then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character (norton)another psycho? maybe i'm missing the point, but do we really need another film about psychos? or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry? for a moment there, i was going to make a mental note of the director's name; now i'm left feeling indifferent. at least it should be added in the film's defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles. also, evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential.

i felt this movie started out well. the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation, even though the true family unit was not completely revealed. we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe. i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off. another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end, and i was begging for it to just be over with. any movie with such a long drawn out , and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting. we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience. in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater. this movie pulled me in then just spit me out.

i'm 47 years old and i've spent as much of my life as i can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi films. be they silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them that i can't find something to like about. that said, i'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all. this is a case of effects over story. truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film. therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story. a good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. this movie doesn't even have good acting, only good effects. so unless you can only about the gore, pass this one up.

my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage. the acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of oklahoma and the plot, such as there was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them. mother f seems to be the "writer's" favorite because it is used constantly. it must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call. thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward. don't waste your time or money with this.

i'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director eduardo sanchez, who helmed the wildly popular and successful blair witch project. besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like stephen king's dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but i enjoyed.but nope, unfortunately i felt that for the most parts, altered is a waste of time, so i shall keep this review short. premises are always promising, and altered's no different. it tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so i shall not go into details, but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget.what if you're given a chance for revenge? that is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive. what will you do? for this group, it's a gleeful payback time, or so they thought. and this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. even if it's low budgeted, there aren't many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. it's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.what's good though is the makeup. much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which i shan't mention, because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.watch this only as a last resort. compared to the other monster movie in town - feast, this one is less fun, and takes itself too seriously. bogged down by an uninspiring direction, you've been warned.

this weekend just passed i watched "28 weeks later" which was very good. after that i watched this film. i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch. the scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no plot. the alien creature was unreal. and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight. and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film.forget about this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later.cheers, mesake c.

i might not have been the biggest blair witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so i was looking forward to altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various imdb comments. "unique", "intelligent", "a future cult classic" and so on... you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort.because alas, altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. the silliness is not funny. the horror and gore is not scary. and whatever "thinking" aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.ok, so we know nothing stands out. is it at least bearable? is the experience worthwhile in any way? unfortunately, no. for starters, get very poor acting. it's not a stretch to say most b-movies these days feature better acting. the plot? boring and messy. dialogs? many amateurs actually do better.it's really the direction that puzzles. i did not expect major improvements over blair witch but at least small steps forward. instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences.if there is a major flaw in altered, it's the main set. a major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. considering that in blair witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. but no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.there's nothing salvageable here. die hard fans of "blair witch" are better off following daniel myrick. although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than sánchez and some lessons from blair witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).

after reading the first 5 reviews on imdb i was very enthusiastic about this movie. but it's really an awful movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the acting is over the top en the story, oh boy, which story?the story doesn't seem to go in a direction, first they capture the alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they capture it?). then the girlfriend, who's acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she doesn't, then again, she does and then she doesn't. then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race (and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? they torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces.this is my first review on imdb, i'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this movie.

this is a copy of the 1948 doris day classic, romance on the high seas.the story line is more or less same but is contemporary. govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip. while rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour. they ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in bombay.on the trip, govinda mistakes another girl for sanjiv's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing rani.lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings. they are pitted against each other for the warring couple.it is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling. the comedy is slap-stick and will not make one laugh too much.

manoj agrawal after the failure of pardesi babu(1998) returned with this filmthe film has govinda in 8-9 roles, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later-on he also has disguises he in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife, whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with ranihe disguises as a sardarji in the plane and again as a girl the funny part is how easily and in short time he does that?then he disguises as a french singer and enters a tv to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian(yes inside the tv itself) the rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note there are some funny scenes like govinda being bashed by an african and also many other portions direction by manoj agrawal is okay music is okayamongst actors govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors he as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6-7 roles don't actually fit in the film rani looks fat, teams up well with govinda thatz it she is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles amongst rest nirmal pandey is as usual johny lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older tinnu anand is okay satish kaushik is hilarious, paresh is okay tanaaz is okay

wow, what a snoozer. definately one of bacon's worst films. the bad acting coupled with a formulatic, if not incredulous, script make me yearn for time i wasted on viewing this on cable television back. not really much i can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. grade: f+

i don't know why, but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen, i often think of "the air up there". i know that technically, lots of movies are horrible compared to it, and i have seen worse acting. it's just that it's so bland, so predictable. in a word: mediocre.

this comedy is really not funny. it' a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact. it's a caper film so derivative -- yes, even back then -- it has no snap.the cast is adequate. more than that it's hard to say. however, what's nice is that the players are unfamiliar. at mgm, this would have starred robert montgomery. the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses.we can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today. and the production values aren't awful. yet it makes no real impression.it's a generic knockoff. and who wants that?

i'm glad the folks at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into. i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i wasn't sure. for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous "twist" ending, which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is. it is hard to describe just how amateurish the hazing really is. did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing? actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is.

this should be re-titled "the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non-horror snorer as a shock film." it's one long, boring tale of a fraternity hazing, a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it. jeff east, an actor in the dues-paying stage, can be forgiven for taking any work he could get. the same can't be said for charles martin smith, who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah. once available on tape but, thankfully, not out on dvd. misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else.

although the movie takes place at an "ivy league" college, it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona, mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of 1976. i was involved in the theater department there, and most of the extras in the film are then-members of the theater department. there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film (if you know your arizona geography) that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek. we nau'ers know that the campus and said creek (actually oak creek canyon) are about 35 miles apart, and while the trip there is all downhill, it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road!

there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film. there's not one scary, funny, or even interesting scene in this film. it advertises itself as a horror, then goes on to call itself a comedy. it doesn't even attempt humor. neither does it attempt to be scary.in order to not be bored by this film, you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all. i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this. its not funny, scary, shocking, or intriguing. so was it supposed to be a drama? because it really wasn't dramatic either.please just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film. life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this.

"the hazing" is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb. yes, that's how shallow i am! i don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie, the poster looks awesome so i guess i'll just have to see it  now, "the hazing" can somewhat be described like its alternate title: curious! the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites, but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller. first of all, there's something very wrong with the tagline on the old vhs box i watched. it says: he had good grades, a good girl and good buddies  until they put him through the hazing". that's not the case, actually. protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship. it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only "buddy" he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith (still with hair in this film). both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious "delts" fraternity, but during their hazing exam  in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies  barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg. when lewis returns with the other frat boys, barney froze to death already. together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski-trip. with barney's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer, lewis has to cover for him so that barney's absence doesn't look suspicious. the set-up of "the hazing" is quite original and potentially innovative, but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better. the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie, even a black one, but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills, neither. the soundtrack is cheerful and full of light-headed tunes, but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy. around an hour into the film, the plot also runs out of steam and idea, and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside. i didn't like the final twist, because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after (though admittedly after). "the hazing" is not a complete waste of time, but still i'm glad i found an ex-rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd.

this movie is pretty awful but i have some interesting information about it:it was filmed in 1976 at northern arizona university in flagstaff, az, as well as at oak creek canyon near sedona, az. a good bulk of the extras in the film are then-drama students from nau. i was a freshman there that year, minoring in theatre, but for some reason i didn't get involved with the production. i did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact:there is a scene in this movie where two of the principals, as part of their hazing ritual, have to run naked into the woods. they are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that. the thing is, those aren't the actors at all but two guys i knew from the theatre department. the identity of these "stunt posteriors" will remain anonymous, at least to this website, unless they decide to, um, "reveal" themselves!

i can only assume that the other reviewers of this "film" are stockholders in the production company, as this was quite possibly the worst movie i've seen in the last five years. from the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered "b-level." both my wife and i were in a great mood before starting this film, and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie. we knew we hadn't rented citizen kane, and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever. however, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage i've ever seen, we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives.if a "comedy" with no laughs, terrible acting, thin plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this film is for you. honestly, troll 2 is better--at least i laughed at the popcorn sex scene.i cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because i've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke.

i sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. my expectations were no where near low enough. i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous. my friends and i managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back. i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time. i honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it, considering not only it's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors/actresses in it's cast. this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made. it's certainly the worst movie i've ever had to sit through.

my eyes! in the name of god and all that is holy make me unsee this movie! what drugs are you people on! this could very well be the worst movie ever! i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time, i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. from start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema. when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought "oh hey, this may be funny! it will probably be bad but still a little funny" how wrong we were, we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be. all of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over, and during the course of the movie, one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon. i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead, that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days. for all who wish to see this movie, you are not prepared! you may think you are some sort of "tough guy" by renting this but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and urinate on you.

during a sleepless night, i was switching through the channels & found this embarrassment of a movie. what were they thinking?if this is life after "remote control" for kari (wuhrer) salin, no wonder she's gone nowhere.and why did david keith take this role? it's pathetic!anyway, i turned on the movie near the end, so i didn't get much of the plot. but this must've been the best part. this nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies. she calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father "oh, i didn't expect tongue!" great lines!after this, i had to see how it ended..well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the swat team is upstairs. and yes...they surround her! and yes yes! the kid blows her brains out!!!! ahahhahahaha!!this is must-see tv. 

i can sit through this movie once, but i doubt i could make it through a second time. mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan. the fun of matt dillon(think something about mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton. this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable. one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part. i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. go see this with your little ones, i.e. the "single digit bracket" kids and don't expect a lot from this film._x

herbie, the volkswagen that thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by maggie peyton (lindsay lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion. the only thing standing in her way is the current champion, trip murphy (matt dillon), who will do anything to stop them.the original love bug wasn't that good. even as a kid, i remember not liking it very much. i had some hope for the sequel though. i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. unfortunately, herbie is no better now than he was before. the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. it will probably entertain the kids but that's all.i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton. she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls. matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. justin long, breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.angela robinson directs and she does an okay job. she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier? these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. in the end, herbie is a safe, predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. everyone else is better off skipping it. rating 4/10

a failure. the movie was just not good. it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at. i mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. lindsey lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies. the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie, that is free.the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. these songs are so good. especially alyson and amanda's walking on sunshine and caleigh peter's, beach boy song, fun fun fun.4 out of 10. if i gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.

i went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. i insisted we go the matinée showing, not because i'm a tightwad, but just feeling i had. in the nascar spirit, this is a sponser's dream. so much blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as an info-mercial, if it weren't for the so-called acting. keeping with tradition, the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines, the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture. earlier herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. ms. lohan, disney's reigning drama queen, has little acting ability. i was surprised that mr. keaton and mr. dillon would get involved in such a project. only the snack bar, was a bigger ripoff!

there are few uplifting things to say about this, but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent, we end up with movies like this.lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take. here she can only fail.children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children (although still pretty dumb). the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. and as a family sports movie this is horrible. the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car-bash fest creating some tension. if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here. after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.

the idea of in the name of the people is good, a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. and you could expect of the actors, especially scott bakula to do some good acting, unfortunately they don't! in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker. the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say... if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking!

the plot of this movie hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. this girl was someone's daughter. i don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else's daughter. or, alternately, could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter. and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.that said, the characters were acted with conviction by the actors. i thought changing scott bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is. you couldn't see into his eyes at all.

ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying breed, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! jeez, when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud? s**t happens. if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection.boring, tedious, and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of coburn/hackman/bergen's presence. nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty. may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth. a monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70's. virtually impossible to sit through the entire film. i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky luke/trinity series. 4 horses/10-all deader'n hell.

this is a movie about animal cruelty. under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death in slow motion. the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. this is one of the sickest, slimiest movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing. as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; i'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.

here's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it. director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game; how much better his the professionals was! the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes. this film needed to be sped-up, if anything. that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments- just lazy. sloppy work. too bad. the actors did ok, but i've certainly seen all of them do better. ben johnson's always a joy, though. i first saw this flick almost 30 years ago; was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later.

gritty, dusty western from director richard brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (gene hackman), a suave gambler (james coburn), a cocky kid (jan michael vincent), and even a female (a surprisingly game candice bergen). once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from gary cooper's era). good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****

i hated the way ms. perez portrayed puerto ricans! we are not all ghetto - and we do speak spanish- not puerto rican! i can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into. but our language is intact, our island is our pride. puerto rico is better off economically than any other caribbean island! i'm glad we are not like cuba, dominican republic or haiti, free from american influence? free in true poverty, not the u.s. standard of poverty. we are not victims we are resilient, humble,honest and intelligent people. our ancestry does include strong african roots, but not "black" roots- i have nothing in common with black americans 9do the research).the analogy between pedro albizu, che guevarra and martin l. king could not be more off the mark.mlk was a great hero a true revolutionary- an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free.che guevarra helped castro create the cuba that is today, is that why boat fulls of cubans risk their lives to come to america- because che made such a better place for them? you had a great, awesome, bright idea but you politicized it too much. we have so many things to be proud of as a people - don't bring shame to our people by victimizing us. i am not a nuyorican and perhaps that is why i can't share your views. i am puerto rican, i speak spanish, i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america. if there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph- there are many.damaris maldonado

i being of puertorican descent, had mixed fillings about this "documentary". first i was offended that ms. perez compared senor campos to che guevarra. also just a point of fact,mr. john leguzaimo is not of puertorican descent.his parents came from columbia. whomever did research on this was not very accurate. i feel that the future of our race rests on education. this message should have been resounding throughout this film, education is our road to freedom and power i think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus.in my opinion,this film swayed toward an anti-american sentiment.

you have to respect this movie. it may be "just a dumb kid's movie" but it's the #1 most frequently requested film title in online movie forums, requested by people who remember the story but can't remember the title. therefore what follows is a much-needed, detailed plot description, since i haven't been able to find such a description anywhere else on the internet.a typical 2-story house is shown in suburbia. 7-year-old bridget narrates about suspecting something is going on since she and her 11-year-old brother andrew are getting presents from their parents for no apparent reason. bridget's present is a stuffed penguin that she immediately names sweet william. bridget describes her relatives: aunt ruth, a bossy nurse taking care of grandmother, grams the hugging grandmother who makes dolls out of socks, and her brother andrew, who's into electronics and is grumpy. grams accidentally hangs up on the lieutenant-governor, which indicates she's getting in the way while living with the family. the two children eat breakfast while the adults discuss moving grams to a retirement home. bridget makes an awful-looking pancake sandwich containing cereal, eggs, bacon, strawberries, and syrup, as andrew looks on incredulously. the two kids then discuss grams, and andrew says bluntly that grams is being "put out to pasture." bridget talks with grams in the attic, has a play tea party with sweet william in her bedroom, then a living doll unexpectedly pops out of her bedroom closet mirror.bridget and the living doll become acquainted. the curly-haired living female doll is named huggins and lives in huggaland. bridget gives huggins a baseball cap from andrew's room. huggins hides under some laundry when bridget's mother comes by, then the mother throws the laundry into the washing machine with huggins in it. bridget rescues huggins and dries her off with a hair drier. they discuss the problem with grams getting old and having to move away, huggins says bridget could talk to the bookworm in huggaland about it, since he knows everything. they step through the mirror to visit huggaland, but one of bridget's tennis shoes becomes lodged in the mirror.rather than walk around with one shoe, bridget goes without shoes in huggaland. they immediately meet hugsy, a curly-haired living boy doll in huggaland. huggins gives hugsy the baseball cap. they also meet tickles, bubbles, impkins, and tweaker, and all the dolls sing a song while sitting on a bridge. hugsy takes bridget and huggins in his hugwagon to see the bookworm, who lives atop a stack of giant books. the bookworm consults "the old encyclopedia" and finds that old age can be cured by eating the fruit of the "youngberry tree." however, only one such tree exists, and it's in the country of shrugs, ruled by the mad queen of quartz. the only way to travel to shrugs is to jump down a deep hole that is located inside a nearby giant book.bridget and the two dolls gulp three times, jump down the hole, and tumble out. soon they walk down a sideways sidewalk, hear the sea of glass breaking, and fall off the sidewalk when the sideways gravity ends. they encounter "the hairy behemoth," which looks like a mastodon, has four tusks, and breathes fire out its trunk. but hugsy boldly goes over and hugs the behemoth, who thereby turns into a baby elephant whose name is hodgepodge. hodgepodge had been under a spell by the queen, and owes hugsy a favor, so they all ride on hodgepodge's back to the castle. they enter the castle, are surrounded by troll-like beings, the queen (queen admira) comes, and bridget asks for a few youngberries. the queen refuses, then eats one for herself, and brags about her own youthful good looks while looking in a hand mirror. hodgepodge faints when the queen says he should be "digested." the queen is upset when bridget mentions that wicked witches should have warts, so the queen freezes bridget and orders the three others to be taken to the dungeon. but the queen carelessly leaves the key to the youngberry tree's dome by the lock to the dome-lifting apparatus.hodgepodge wakes up in the dungeon and uses his "noodle" (trunk) to pull the jail's door down, thereby freeing himself and the two dolls with him. they find bridget standing petrified, the dolls hug her, which causes bridget to be revived. before they flee, bridget finds the left-behind key to the youngberry tree dome, lifts the dome off, and they pick some glowing youngberries and put them in a jar. the queen catches them, but the queen's arm is trapped under the descending dome while reaching for the key that bridget left on the ground. the queen suddenly turns very old since she is deprived of the youth-giving berries, and appears to die. soon bridget steps back through the mirror into her bedroom but trips on the bottom of the mirror, spilling the berries onto her floor, and the berries quickly vanish into smoke, one by one. her mother calls for her and andrew to say goodbye to grams, who is leaving for a retirement home. andrew drops his usual grumpy, standoffish facade and hugs grams, telling her he loves her and that he doesn't want her to go away. their father is moved, and decides to keep grams there after all, and everybody hugs and cries, including aunt ruthie, who had been the main person pressuring grams to move out.andrew asks bridget for his st. louis cardinals cap, bridget starts to explain how she gave it to huggins of huggaland, but andrew doesn't want to listen to what he believes are her fantasy stories, so he turns around to look for it in her bedroom. one of the dolls secretly hands the cap back through the mirror to bridget, bridget puts the cap on andrew's head, andrew is mystified, and leaves her bedroom without saying anything. bridget cheerfully waves at the mirror.

...in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, would-be oedipal comedy.i was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.the bloom is off jon heder's rose. the emerging double chin isn't his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working. it would be another crime if this were to be eli wallach's last screen appearance. diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks.sitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive (laughed, even) whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character. he really is among our very best actors.in summary, even jeff daniels's work can't redeem this picture.

john heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. i felt like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film. anna farris was par for the course, not good, but not horrible (plus she's cute). dianne keaton should have known better. jeff daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (even though it was poor judgement on his part as well). all in all, i would avoid this at all costs. i'm just glad i didn't pay to see it! john heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid,' unless he does some serious work on his acting chops.

yet another "son who won't grow up" flick, and just the other recent like entries. heder in another bad wig, channeling napoleon for, what, the third time? anna faris is forgettable, as always; jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state, at least; and diane keaton...how does one become typecast this late in a career? do not bother. nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over. i will say this; it's about a hundred times better than "failure to launch". there are very few amusing bits in the movie, unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny. ha, ha! he's old and he dropped the f-bomb! tee, hee, hee. pitiful!

this movie is poorly conceived, poorly acted, and poorly written.jon heder is terribly annoying, and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine. self-obsessed and ignorant.furthermore, diane keaton plays the same manish, overly obsessed mother, who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children (see because i said so). anna faris, though i generally like her, plays a vapid idiot in this film as well.jeff daniels is passable but nothing special. please, skip this film if you want to keep your soul.

the wife and i saw a preview of this movie while watching another dvd and thought "jon heder, diane keaton, jeff daniels and eli wallach, it's gotta be better than summer reruns, so i ordered it from local library. well, any episode of "lawrence welk" would bring more laughs than "mama's boy". i actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and i couldn't imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera. perhaps, at least, maybe next time they're offered a movie of this sort, they'll "just say no!' a one anna two....

...except for jon heder. this guy tanked the entire movie.the plot sounded entertaining. a 29 year old slacker son(heder)still lives with widowed mom (keaton)who happens to meet a new love (daniels). slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. he also meets a girl(faris).i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach. heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale. at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end. in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me!

i had high hopes for it when i heard that it was being made back in 2001 because i read "the devil and daniel webster" when i was a kid and i found it very interesting. they made some changes to the story that don't make much sense to me. daniel webster in the story was a famous lawyer from new hampshire in the story. in the movie he is an editor. a lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing jabez stone against the devil him/herself (he was a man in the story, but was a woman in the movie) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line. as an editor, it doesn't seem likely that daniel webster would have the skill to do this.the acting was decent by all except for alec baldwin and dan aykroyd. these are two actors that i like, they just did an awful job in this movie. it was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy, but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy. this might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind, and was then re-edited by somebody else. given this fact, it's surprising that it was at all coherent. i was surprised to see a fair amount of snl cast members in the movie, which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy.all in all i would have to say it wasn't completely awful, but it wasn't much good. if i could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it, i would. the ending was especially disappointing. as in the original story, daniel webster defeats the devil in the trial. jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally, we are just brought back to the first scene with jabez, and then the movie abruptly ends. it actually looked as though they just replayed jabez' first scene over and called it the end. there is no indication that jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained, so who is to say he didn't just repeat his mistakes over again, and perhaps over and over in an endless loop? it was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense. the decent cast, and the acting of everyone except for baldwin and aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich.

once again the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life: success. unfunny script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines in order to understand the "strong" "christmanish" message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent hopkins beat the devil (jennifer love hewitt is no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character. not bad efforts from the actors (baldwin also as a director, cattrall in a "sex and the city" role again, aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). p.s. try also a not so popular film from greece called "alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth)

i went for this movie believing it had good ratings. firstly, it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in india. everything in the movie looks dated. even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget. there is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get. anthony hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. he ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. if the film had bright sparks during that scene, i missed it as i was sleeping on my seat. nothing about jennifer love hewitt resembles a devil. she wears ill-fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. as for alec baldwin a scene where he goes to meet webster for the first time is not to be missed. what a waste of money! as anthony hopkins rightly put it, "go back home and write better!"

my roommates & i nearly shorted out our tv from the numerous spit-takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo-zen dreck. i'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night tv listings for years in search of this elusive turd. several years ago our local abc affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick (ie "frogs", "night of the lepus", etc). then one day it happened: at 1:40am on a saturday night (over 5 years ago) there it was! we had over 15 folks over and the flick did not disappoint!see! andy griffith as the silliest & most unthreatening bad guy since jaye davidson in "stargate"!see! william shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair (or anything organic for that matter).hear! jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes "chicken soup for the soul" sound like bf skinnerfeel! content that any decade was better than the 70s.for those still reading...the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a--holes who decide to suck up to their s---head boss (griffith) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans california & mexico. they all wear leather jackets, looking more christopher street than anything else. along the way they stop at a cantina, get drunk, smoke joints (the sight robert "mike brady" reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget), start a fight, attempt rape, and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs. although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness.

body slam (1987) is a flat out terrible movie. the low budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting is lame. but if you're into old school wrestling (circa 1970's through the mid-80') then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer. i have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. i gave it a two because i felt like being generous. this turkey was "directed" by stunt master hal needham. the stars are roddy piper, the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (dirk benedict).the synopsis of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair rock" and wrestling. but their are others that don't want him to succeed. there's more but i don't want to spoil it for you. if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline, there's a few surprises near the end for die-hard wrestling fans. i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy (and i mean it).

i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was. it was a combination of every horror/thriller cliché, trying to comment on many things including pedophilia, satan worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion... and it was a mess. the acting was pretty washboard; the kid and the jesus dude were alright, but apart from them.... anyways. i admire the effort (though slightly failed) on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different way...even though they did that, the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish. but then again, it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid... no. actually, i've decided it's just all around bad. music... oh my gosh... horrible... toooo over-dramatic. okay. i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier; it seemed like a poor student project. i'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap. there you go.

the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested (as often they did) a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive-in screens. claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook, who worked in films for years. this one's quite hard to find anymore; i'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day, but don't remember particularly impressed way back when. chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to u.s. theatres and video. but oh, that one sheet...still a gem of my later horror collection.

absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc... when our hero, gaston, is given the grand show by dr. maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific, such as men hanging around long in a dungeon, and comedic, such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building. then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's right a chicken, that pecks around the ground for chicken feed. the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film, but, at least for me, it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining. ah! that is indeed the real horror that is dr. tarr and his legion of name changes. and that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once. this is definitely garbage. it has very little going for it. the only performer worth having a look at is claudio brook as the head of the asylum. he is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with sword in hand, and praises the chicken. i got so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as his means to cure the mentally sick. what a bunch of ludicrosity(hey, a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). it won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting. cinematic chicken scratch!

if this movie were any worse, it would have been directed by uwe boll. this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock. it has been a while since i have seen this steaming pile , but i do remember that i wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved. how anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe. i give it one star because there is not a rating lower. all copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste. no, one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it.

i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk. the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species. their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized. everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. they are on the make or beating each other up. it's as if the scriptwriter said, what can i make up for them to do, without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is. watch the wonderful human portrayal in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" where the illnesses are believable and real. i once worked in a state mental hospital. i didn't see any of these guys. these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life.

i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead. you gotta love those bargain packs. for even if they don't feature true remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, there's no denying that there are always a few gems included. and by "gems", i mean there's always some good crap to be seen, especially if the films are from the '70s as the mansion of madness is.my copy is called mansion of madness, but when the title screens roll it's poe's dr. tarr's torture dungeon. doesn't matter, really, as crap is crap is crap, no? yes! but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all. there are some funky elements here and there, and obviously the flick did have a decent budget.the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look. the dialogue is always hilarious. near the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. "what strength!" says our hero. funny, then, that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun. you'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end. that's how memorable these characters are.the best part about mansion of madness, however, has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure. it's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable. and why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? i'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop. what the hell? oh yeah, there's plenty of boobies to be seen, too, for those of you that dig such things. boobies, bad dialogue, and wacky music. that best sums of mansion of madness for me. it's well worth at least one viewing, and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or whatnot. i can't say i was ever bored watching it, but i can't deny that it's also a barrel of poop. kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot, but not. hmm.and mr. chicken pwnz.

although i rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. i couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i didn't care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script. the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. it doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. i particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. genius!

all the other comments already said what i was going to say, here goes anyway. i thought this was italian at first, sorry about that, italy. i wasn't bored because i kept waiting for something to happen. who did that song about dr. tarr and professor feather way back when? was it alan parsons? saw this on a brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected, terrible. full of streaks and stuff. the movie was an incoherent mess. goofy music and clueless characters. the main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. i thought the "doctor" directing the "battle" scene was never going to end. had some good looking babes though. it seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked. i gave it a 2 for the nekkid women. that bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs. poe probably did about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his.

i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. i'm an open minded guy after all and i’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks. as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say. here goes: "this film was mercifully short." that's all i got.okay, okay. the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits. i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.by the time of the "chicken dance" at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. i don't know what could have salvaged this film. the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film. either way, i'm not watching this film again unless i'm really depressed. then i can tell myself “at least i wasn’t in ‘dr. tarr's torture dungeon.’ i’m better than those guys."

dr tarr's torture dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. however, the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be, and the asylum is being run by the patients, and the doctors are in cages. first of all, some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons(a guy who thinks he's a chicken, for instance). i have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the film itself bombs. the music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy, and yes, there is a scene involving dancing chicken men, which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen. watch this film at your own risk! rated: r for violence and nudity.

a stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients. despite an initially hostile response, he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor. and, as the doctor shows him about, he talks and talks and talks!!! and as he talks, loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive. while there is some action here and there (and some of it quite disturbing), it's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is--lacking life and energy, which is odd for a horror flick. even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome. the further this tour takes the guest, the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers. yet again, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many places--particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set. only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell, starving, does the film have any real impact. considering this plot, it sure is hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have! now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and direction, this could have been an interesting and worthwhile film.you know, now that i think about it, this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original "star trek" tv show! you know, the one with "lord garth--master of the universe" and kirk and spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers.a final note: the film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be forewarned--it's not for kids. in fact, considering how worthless the film is, it isn't for anyone! however, with the version included in the "50 movie pack--chilling classics", the print is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark.

i've waited a long time to see dr tarr's torture dungeon and after i watched it, i was really disappointed by it. it's not the baroque film i expected it to be. the trailer (which i saw on a something weird dvd) is much better than the entire film, which is remarkably forgettable. there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other baroque styled movies out there, from fellini or jodorowsky. the characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc.the main problem with dr tarr's torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else. it was almost like watching a book. i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see/listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about dull stuff.a missed opportunity.

relative to other columbo movies, this can only be rated a 1 (awful). i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train-crash of a film. it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it - to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next.another reviewer suggested that it was falk's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role. in fact, i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses, who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. it's a wonder they didn't murder him.

ok, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.i pity the fools who still think so... its absolute rubbish.the story is just ... ridiculous. the characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise, im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it?dean and others, are too old for their parts. people say dean is great in this film, and well, maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've. his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. but dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.natalie wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. it sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.it may've been good for its time, but, really, its drivel.it must've just been hype about dean's death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.

was this a comedy or was it a drama? i begin this review by asking this question because the film that i just witnessed, hollywood shuffle, was neither funny or rather dramatic. while it tried so hard to make a point, because of this lack of definition (comedy or drama), the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost. while i am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in hollywood, even today, i do not believe that townsend's directorial debut did much to stop it. instead, i feel it only added more fuel to the fire. townsend's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of, he was instead promoting and vice versa. the parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy. townsend had a decent concept with this film, but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film. if you watch the preview before the film (which i constantly do), you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see. the preview gives the impression of a very intelligent, comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers, but the actually film could not be further from the truth.the main problem with hollywood shuffle is not story itself (because it is lacking in elaboration); it is townsend's direction. he had a wonderful concept with this film. exploit the hollywood that exploits our race. decent idea, but why couldn't he execute it very well? the first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic. the structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital, we are literally everywhere without any warning or map. it was obvious that townsend had quite a bit to say, but only a short amount of time to do it in. so, instead of defining his characters, developing his themes, and actually creating a smart film, he just throws it all together and prays that it works. sadly, it doesn't. instead of a smart comedy, we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas, comedic skits, and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable. what hurts townsend the most are his brief, attempt to be funny, interruptions throughout the film. from battling a villain known as jerry curl to parodying siskel & ebert, townsend's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters. this is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally. while townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in hollywood, he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and cliché in the book. what could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest.so, if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story, perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story. wrong! the wayans are in this film, but townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family. definitely in their pre-in living color moments, we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon. perhaps it was townsend's direction, or just maybe this atrocious story, but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film. i just thought that with the talent pool that townsend had to pull from that hollywood shuffle would have been funny, bright, and a true stab at this obvious hollywood dilemma. sadly, it was none of the above.finally, i would like to say that this was a workable film. there were some moments (while they were few and way far between) that had a smile on my face, the final product just didn't settle well with me. townsend can be funny, but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself, instead of through his personal experiences and troubles. i realize that he was probably speaking the truth, but it never came through as that. instead, we are threaded through a weak story, which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom, but surely didn't work for this film. even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film, i would have to disagree. if you are starting fresh, either have a tight script or defined themes. townsend had neither of these, and combined with the inability to control his actors, he just failed in a ball of flames.overall, this was rather disappointing to watch. it reminded me of a grade school spelling bee where it is finally your child's time to spell. the word is tough, but as the first two to three letters come out, you think that it is going to work perfectly, but then there is that random "p" and silent "r" that forces your excitement to come tumbling down. that is how i felt with hollywood shuffle. at first, i saw the potential, i saw the theme and the motive behind the picture, but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes, i experienced that deep fall feeling. townsend sank his own ship on this one, and i don't think hollywood shuffle will ever re-submerge as a pivotal moment of hollywood cinema.grade: * out of *****

well i don't know what people saw in this movie i don't know. i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache. other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie.the big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age. i didn't like the movie at all. i wanted to give 1 rating but giving 3 as i like the role of the small girl who is called "sexy" by ab. my word "dont watch"save your self donot watch this movie.save time and money.

the subject this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut (ad)venture is quite an age-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance (pun intended).however, the exploration (and exploitation for desi auds) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to 'pepper, spice and sugar' up the usual masala mix of b/g score, dialog, dance, drama, etc creates a nice-looking package with not much inside.in the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times. further repeats follow thru-out the movie (after all the lead character's a cook). but therein lies les problemos -- no story! hah, no wonder. someone forgot to write a script.amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada (more) amount of over-acting. really when is this guy ever gonna stop?? how many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something??? timeless mind yes, but surely what about the not-so-ageless bod? and sole? sorry, soul?! reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film. the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery of a hot new idea. nowhere are we presented with any real-life problems or issues such a pair might face, other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle. the sub-plot of a little kid with cancer (the bachelor boy's first love) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl's character.anyway, nice try but not quite there yet.

in this movie, the old amitabh bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. he meets her in his restaurant. the younger woman, tabu, flirts with him. he does not know what to do and asks her out. her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. is was supposed to be funny.and that annoys me about this whole movie. it wasn't that funny. the jokes and script was terrible! the only jokes i liked was about the teeth of a waiter, but after a several times, even that began to bore.amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. this was a weird relationship! a little girl with the mind of an old woman! it was frightening! i know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. it did not make any sense.tabu's father is paresh rawal. he has to give amitabh a hard time, but we all know paresh, he can't do that. so even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was supposed to be funny.i only like movies who really are funny. i suppose i will never watch this movie again.

r balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram gopal verma in nishabd in a sensuous way. this time it is mixed with mature humors.amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian cuisine in london. he is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job. according to him, cooking is an art. still cannot make hyderabadi biryani properly.enter tabu who sends her the proper hyderabadi biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other amitabh is 65 and tabu is 35. no probs! but one hitch! tabu's father paresh rawal!! the couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage. but amitabh realizes that tabu's father is much younger to him. and the complications begin performance wise all three actors are brilliant. the script of the film is very tight and interesting. the dialogues of the film are catchy. but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. the comedy is sometimes not properly understood. the film also tries to go lengthy at some parts.musically nothing much to sing about except the title track. the camera-work is good. director r balki could have given much better from this script. but in the second half he himself looks confused. the "satyagrah" scene of the father looked irritating. but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are clap worthy.on the whole, cheeni kum needed to have more sugar!

when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other, the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old amitabh bachchan romances a 34-yr old tabu. wait! in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of "cheeni" it is the content that is "kum" in this adman turned writer-director r. balki's maiden effort..trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair, and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half. the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating. by the end of first half, romance completed and mission accomplished. there is not much left to be said. therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl's father to the extent that he goes for a satyagrah is really a test of patience. there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in. the result, second half is dry, flat with no energy. there is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer, not making much impact. nonetheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances.

this movie is not only boring, it is also really badly done. the graphics are so bad, they are not even second rate - they are dreadful. the characters do not show any facial expresssions, the voice acting is empty and without any soul, and the plot absolutely lacks .... well... anything and everything. my 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit boring. i agree with him.

this thing is really awfull. there´s no charachter with weight, they´re all floating around in the bg´s. the motion capture is a fine toy, but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film. the machine can´t do anything well by itself. if you see it as a bizarre film, you´ll have fun finding mistakes of continuity... in a 3d movie!!! it´s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics. you need animators and 3d animators, not data-entries whom know 3d programs. note the junctions, like the elbows, how they lost volume and get deformed. the person who made the charachter design (a very good one) sufered for sure when he/she watched them move, ´cos you can´t say they come to life.

this movie is deeply idiotic. a man wants revenge for a crime- but when he enacts his revenge- there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time. what man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera?just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me- but it got dumber!!!i am thinking the script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an battalion of armored tanks through.plot: a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong, and then the unexpected unfolds.if only these people writing this story hadn't been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way. to the writers i say- seek help for your serious mental problem.

the premise of the film is that thomas archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized -- and he is given a chance at revenge when (after post traumatic stress disorder therapy), he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit. he is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, sledgehammers, torches, whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being.we go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime. the two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why.well, when all is said and done, we don't really care...

thomas archer (ron eldard) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion. dr. heller (christopher plummer) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress. then archer finds himself confronted with a man (til schweiger) bound and gagged to a chair. he is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him. and there's a large assortment of instruments there to help him...film is interesting at first (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns. it all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that i was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore. how such talented actors like eldard, schweiger and plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me. this gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through.

i watched this film a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and liked it then. i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. the second time around was not pleasant. the acting is 'so,so', the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable.the acting...i'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. the plot...there's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd. (side note: why did tt not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer! ding, ding...we have a crook!). it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can 'beat the system' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. it plays too much on sympathy b/c all of them die in the end (bar jada) but it's not sad (you're thinking 'they were so stupid; they deserve to die). you just don't really care about the characters unless you're a shallow person.i can't believe this film rates over a 5.

without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years. the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with. it's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions. oh no, the cops are on to us, they know who we are, what do we do?...let's rob one more bank then we're outta here! what!?! every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead.

an interesting idea (four african american women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by f. gary gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by takashi bufford and kate lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments. instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, gray, bufford and lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. it's melodrama at its worst. gray has his actors linger over every tired line and john carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces. and bemused they are: although actors such as jada pinkett, kimberly elise and vivica a. fox have some raw talent (queen latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. steer clear.

after a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene, 'set it off' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. this is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. in short, it's no different from 90% of hollywood product. but it's the racial angle that makes 'set it off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. posing as a celebration of 'sistahood', the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican-american 'gangsta' stereotype. the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. worse, 'set it off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to rodney king), and aspirational 'good' sista, jada pinkett smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. 'set it off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it. while the likes of 'shaft' and 'superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. 'set it off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african-american film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.

we all knew even before it aired, the ron moore mini-series is no battlestar galactica. that's fine. it just means it must stand on its own. it can't lean on battlestar galactica. if it's any good, it's good on it's own merits, and ron moore has something to be proud of. if reports are true, this is what moore wanted. however, if his mini-series rots, he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on-screen, not to mention the myriad off-screen personnel. and this is what he's done.yes, this mini-series is no remake. i wouldn't even call it a re-imagining. it's a new production, inspired by battlestar galactica. it does not take place in the galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. it doesn't tell of the galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica. ron moore's mini-series is a space-opera, action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica.maybe i should say, "just another" space-opera, action flick. because as plots go, his has little that's original, or even interesting. i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. but i won't inflict that on you. i'll just hit the most important point. ready now? here it is: just watch the trailer. it will tell you everything there is in the story.yes, creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man. (i guess they forgot azimov's rules, again.) they look like humans, so there's the whole aliens-among-us thing. at least there's no time-travel. oh, and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica, that ceremonial nod, it came off more corny than respectful. i mean, couldn't he even think up anything of his own?from the first few minutes, i wanted to watch something else. i didn't care about any of moore's characters, since i couldn't identify with any of them. this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack. armageddon on a planetary scale, and i didn't give a damn. how depressing.moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, rather tucked tail and saved their own butts. after all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. they took the safe way out, rather than risking their own lives to defend others. at least disgust is not apathy.but in the end, the ron moore mini-series was just activity without purpose, a movie on a treadmill, forever running yet going nowhere. and i just wanted it to be over. and by the time it was over, my life-force had been sucked from me. against my own will, i was turning into a mindless, soulless zombie, probably of the type to which this mini-series would appeal. i needed to replenish myself. i needed to-and i swear this is true-i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5. two episodes, in fact, and i felt much better. and happier.

don't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?such is how i felt watching this so-called "battlestar galactica". arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains, it's not what the fans ordered.imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant i mentioned. you have waited years for them to bring back their famous new york strip steak which you loved. when your meal arrives, you find they've applied the name "new york strip" to a chicken dish. you complain but the waiter merely states "but ze cheeken, ees really good zir"! do you really care if the chicken is good? you wanted new york strip - a steak! the waiter then explains, "you zee zir, ze chef wanted to to do, as you zay, zomezing new. we felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh". you ask if you will ever find the original new york strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant has a dish called "new york strip" now on the menu, you'll never see the original new york strip - ever again.such is the case with creating something new and slapping the "battlestar galactica" namesake on it.* this mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! *it's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original. the team put in charge of resurrecting bg should have loved the original series - seeking to improve what the fans loved, not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the battlestar galactica name.if scifi channel wanted to give us a new show, then do so! give it a new name! don't use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers. that effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future.we have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as bg because we liked something about the original! we didn't simply want the name and remnants of the basic concept. there are things we loved about the original series!sadly, probably the best elements of the original were those which were omitted. sure, the original bg was imperfect and could have used some updating. this mini series, however, was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects (which were good but not anything unusual by today's standards).many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this new show but we will not forgive scifi and ron moore for destroying our dream.that being said... i shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself (not in comparison to the original):the battle sequences were the best part. effort was obviously put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". i would not say these sequences were exceptional by today's standards yet they were in keeping with made-for-cable original movies. what was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? some views tried to fake the effect of a "real" camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms. however, it was over-used considering there was no apparent source of these cameras. the infinitely more intelligent series, babylon 5, is the only instance i've seen such "live cams" used effectively, when we were supposedly witnessing action from security cams.the script, you ask? the script felt like it was written by a teenager, for other teenagers. the characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. indeed, the whole story felt pieced together from other well-known stereotypes. the only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series. it was obviously "dumbed down" for digestion of your average tv audience.the human interaction was pitiful. rather than drama based on subtle looks, expressions and fine timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer. such was obvious in any interaction between adama and son. the director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer wouldn't miss it even if not paying attention. sorry, but real humans don't behave like the continually.i wouldn't have considered this a bad show had it stood on its own. nothing great; it will never be revered by true scifi fans or artisans, but it would be watchable by the masses. i personally could have lived without it, though. i only watched it to see how it really did capture the spirit of the original. how this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers. how even scifi channel has "dumbed down" its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market, the science fiction fans. it will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints.i leave you with only one thought - no "moore".

this movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. the box art for the video markets it as a "fun throwback" to 1950s giant bug movies. in reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of "aliens".the producers clearly wanted to make an "alien" picture, but they mustn't have had much money. in fact, it doesn't look like they had any money, really. i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing.the basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, i presume. instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare. the amusing thing about "blue monkey" (and there is only one thing amusing about it) is, the filmmakers didn't abandon the "alien" aesthetics. even though we're in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable "growth hormone" plot device. the annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth. the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats.the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. he touches it and says "ow", so we know he's been hurt. the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (i guess in an "alien" picture this would be called the "mouthburster"?). the worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and "accidentally" give it some experimental growth hormone. you know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms. the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness.which brings us back to "alien". how, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the "alien" movies? no problem...a power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie. this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they don't move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy).ok, so what "alien" bases haven't we covered...oh, water dripping down the walls! check...we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side. problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous "foreboding tunnel" shots. and don't forget the fog...well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? ok, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn.i haven't said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. i take it "blue monkey" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag. see a film called "return of the aliens: the deadly spawn" if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent. this one falls flat on its alien.

oh god,what an idiotic movie!incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(ha!ha!ha!)...they're simply ludicrous.for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).all in all,this is a great entertainment if you're drunk.avoid it like the plague.am i drunk?i don't think so...

an older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting. he gets pricked by it, or bitten by something on it. he quickly becomes ill, and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind. a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot-out. somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought in. there are several young kids wandering around the hospital, who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable, but who are extremely annoying little brats. they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept, and happen to dump a growth hormone on it. horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they're never even in any danger.the critter grows and starts breeding. people run away from it, and sometimes towards it for some reason. the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.there are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster. it was fairly boring. clearly it owes something to the alien movies, with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth. there's also a character named bishop, and the lead actress has sigourney weaver's hair.

blue monkey (1987) or 'invasion of the bodysuckers' as it's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant!!!! the man gets rushed to hospital, where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth, of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage!! despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie, i found it to be boring, with a flat predictable storyline, un-interesting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action!!!! horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down, you wont be missing much trust me!!! i give this movie 2/10.

now, it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title, so i'll wait on that. first, this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles. then i realized it, this is a movie with a message, that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen. things like what you ask? things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical "kill the monster indirectly" fashion. now, as promised... blue monkey... has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind. now it snot like i was cheated or anything. the picture on the cover had a giant bug/crab/idiot/thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses. that kinda happened but i wanted apes! having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before(half drunk on cask and creame's brandy mind you) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80's style. not so much. if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you. if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids, rent this.

all this dismaying waste of film stock needs is count floyd popping up every sixty seconds. somehow they got steve railsback, susan anspach, john vernon, and joe flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles, about eight kilometers, of an actual movie. boy does this thing suck. there isn't one original line, thought, shot, or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close. the magical, ethereal susan anspach of five easy pieces - boring. steve railsback - boring. john vernon - boring. the big bug - boring. if this is a scary movie, buttercream gang is a thuglife documentary. seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. usually it's in the opening credits - "written, directed, and produced by" one guy. or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made. here, you don't find out till the very last of the credits, where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the canadian government is gratefully acknowledged. right now i'm watching mst's take on beast of yucca flats to get the taste out of my mouth. ghod, what an improvement.

when i first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) and the name "blue monkey", i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie. i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese-ball flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles.... the fx are pretty corny, there isn't too much of a plot, and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey. but come on people, what did you expect?? it's not really as bad as it seems.... if you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies, this one is basically an updated version, without the updates special fx

never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it, hidden deep in my dusty horror closet. the title on the box said "insect" and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. they can surely be fun, of course, as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in "blue monkey"! the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense. following the always-popular trend of "big-bug" movies, "blue monkey" handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. the makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! all we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. other than this, there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! like i said, don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. the first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. it is also near the end that "blue monkey" begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore. "blue monkey" is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made. fans of b-cinema may recognize john vernon ("killer klowns from outer space", "curtains") in the small and meaningless role of roger, who's in charge of the clinic.

blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. at one point,some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels, exploring. they begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them (a girl) says she bets they'll find a blue monkey.yes, thats it. totally inconsequential to the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement.i'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose!

oh god,what an idiotic movie!incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(ha!ha!ha!)...they're simply ludicrous.for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).all in all,this is a great entertainment if you're drunk.avoid it like the plague.am i drunk?i don't think so...

robert altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from edmund naughton's book "mccabe" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don't merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and altman's pacing is deliberately slow. there's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. it's a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from ****

i've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. i can't say that i found much to recommend it. the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. the film looks authentic enough, but something's got to happen for it to work, and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematically. it just slogs along. flawed as it is, cimino's "heaven's gate" has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film i'd sooner watch again. for a brilliant reconception of the west, hbo's "deadwood" is much superior to "mccabe."

*mccabe and mrs. miller* takes place in the turn-of-the-century pacific northwest. into a soggy, muddy mining camp john mccabe (a hirsute warren beatty) comes barging, full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon/whorehouse for the town, replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history. he also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger: too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it, but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha-male credentials amongst the locals. and thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour.it looks to be a rather sorry operation until mrs. miller (julie christie) shows up on a startling contraption that's half-railroad car, half-automobile (where did altman find that thing?). mrs. miller immediately takes on mccabe as a business partner, with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering. noting that mccabe doesn't know how to add, she also insists on handling the accounts. it's not clear what mccabe's function will be.the plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer mccabe to buy him out for five grand. mccabe tells them to buzz off -- he's holding out for fifteen thousand. the company finds negotiation distasteful, so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill mccabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as mccabe's function in the whorehouse partnership. (excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward-money offered by the local marshal would be pretty tempting.) *mccabe and mrs. miller*, purportedly "classic seventies cinema", should be a lot better than it is. the movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting. there are some striking scenes, especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer. but it's really, really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing. once again, this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness. according to the trivia-sheet here on imdb, the movie's editor griped to altman that the sound was muddy; altman disagreed; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie's release, altman blamed the editor. (nice.) along with the bad sound, the movie has an atrocious look. only robert altman can hire a world-class dp like vilmos zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater. reviewers here who praise the "dark brown glow" of this picture have got to be kidding me. the interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum. the exterior photography is even worse: it's as if altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees. during the climactic stretch, when beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire, altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow-fall that reminds one of a rankin-bass christmas special.look -- i can't watch a movie under these conditions. get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes, when you remove all that annoying "altman-esque" overlapping dialog, and when you wipe the lenses with some windex, or something. 3 stars out of 10.

i watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, i found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. the terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. and the sad thing is--internally she dies. eventually she goes back to the applacian mountains. all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. i'm surprised this movie takes place in detroit, because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to cincinnati, ohio. this also was a route for the poor from the mountains.

historically accurate? hmm... perhaps... if you squint, and light falls upon the subject just-so. but core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal, patchy and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion. the principal characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes that range from the 'enigmatic and noble' american indians through to the 'stuffy but sadistic' british officers. a wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in american history. i want my money back.

how they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me. this movie is absolutely terrible. i discovered, after reading some of the other reviews, that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film, which deeply puzzles me, because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution. it's not just that it's a bad movie, with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant, but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded (which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does, though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards) or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. for example, we see donald sutherland running around with a huge, fat ugly mole on his face. he does not normally have a mole. the mole does not add to his character. it is extremely ugly and distracting. it's not like robert de niro's mole; it's much worse. why the hell has he got that mole? it's as if the filmmakers just said, "let's see, how could we make this movie even worse than it already is? i know, let's give mr. sutherland a giant, ugly-ass mole right on his face."another example of the filmmakers' stupidity is the character ned. we see, for the first three-quarters of the movie, young ned. at one point, "six months later" appears on the screen. we see ned again, and it is, of course, the same actor playing the boy. five minutes later, "three weeks later" appears on the screen, and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older ned. what, do they think we're idiots? good god! again, it's like the filmmakers are saying, "how can we possibly make it any worse? i don't think we can...oh wait! i just had a terrible idea!" i know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year, which is fine, but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks. just don't get another actor to play ned, or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger. furthermore, the kid who plays the "older" ned does not look any older than "young" ned. as a matter of fact, he just looks completely different, much skinnier, and no taller or older than the original actor, which is very confusing, as i, like any rational human being, thought at first that it was a new and different character.what, did the first kid die while they were filming the movie? because he was in it for the first hour and a half, and then all of a sudden, three weeks later, the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrels is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie. and even if the original actor did die, the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role, and re-shoot the measly five minutes of "six months later" scenes. better yet, just scrap the movie completely, never finish it and never release, never even tell anybody about it, because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time.i'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it; it's so bad that you should watch it, just to see how badly it sucks. it's terrible, terrible.

damp telling of the american revolution.when farmer 'tom dobb' (al pacino) and his son arrive in new york harbor, they are immediately conscripted by street urchin annie lennox... annie lennox?... to contribute to the war effort.after getting chopped down by bits of chain-link fired from british cannons, tom and his son are promptly chastised by continental army sympathizer 'daisy' (nastassja kinski) for 'not standing their ground'. following this kodak moment, a series of digressive chapters take place including tom's participation in a 'foxhunt' in which he must carry a model of "poor old georgie washington" stuffed in effigy while running from a lace handkerchief-wielding english captain (manning redwood), and having a barbecue with a group of iroquois indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so al and his ingrate kid can kick the crap out of british officer donald sutherland's butt.director hugh hudson presents a unique style of film-making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial london fog, but the scriptwriter's painting of the redcoats as evil monsters once again reveals hollywood's patented hatred of the british.steven berkoff appears as an enlisted american soldier.

revolution is a terrible movie, i don't care if you're a history teacher, news writer, al pacino fan, there's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate '10'.the key point to the plot is tom dobb (al) trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat. everything revolves around that note. tom's son joins the army to make up for the note, making tom join the army as well, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat. the end.it had a few battle scenes, and they were pretty mediocre at best. transistions between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle. the love story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow. so save your "notes" and watch the patriot instead.

this movie was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war. it had memories from "dances with wolves" for the big prairies, indians, military fights & from "barry lyndon" for the british & candles lights atmospheres...unfortunately, the script is awful: the continuity of the story is lacking (cuts with "5 months later"; "3 years later") & the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it: america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other; above all, wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story (imagine the same in "titanic").sometimes, a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker. unfortunately bis, hudson is a poor one. he has already committed "greystoke" and i find again the same flaws: no dynamic in scenes, in editing, in scoring: it is long, dull, flat....i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacino's career: now i understand. finally, this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me: a painful one...

brilliant actor as he is, al pacino completely derails revolution  his method acting approach is totally ill-suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the american war of independence. much of the blame should be attributed to director hugh hudson (yes, the man who made chariots of fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a come-down!!). one of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors, coaxing believable performances from them, but in this case hudson has allowed pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. it's not just al's career-low performance that hinders the film though: there are numerous other flaws with revolution, more of which will be said later.illiterate trapper tom dobb (al pacino) lives in the north-eastern region of america with his son ned (sid owen/dexter fletcher). he leads a simple life  living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements. the country is lorded over by the english colonialists, but during an eight year period (1775-83) a revolution takes place which ends with the british being defeated and the independent american nation being born. dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the continental army  swept away by events they can barely understand, the dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. tom also falls in love with daisy mcconnahay (natassja kinski), a beautiful and fiery woman of british aristocratic ancestry. their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.where to start with the film's flaws? most key actors are miscast  pacino has been criticised enough already, but kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while donald sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless english soldier with a wobbly yorkshire accent. robert dillon's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. at no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the american revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. as a result, the narrative falls into no man's land, flitting from "grand spectacle" to "small story" indiscriminately and meaninglessly. john corigliano's score is quite ghastly, and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. hugh hudson's direction is clumsy throughout, both in his mismanagement of pacino and the other key actors, and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. the idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of "being there" in the confusion of battle and musket fire. like so many other things in the film, it doesn't work. the one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. but if it's period detail you're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time, because as a rousing cinematic experience revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade. nothing more than a £18,000,000 mega-bomb that the ailing british film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s.

extremely thin 'plot' of satanic rituals or some such mumbo-jumbo provides the hokey excuse to thread copious amounts of sex scenes together. straight vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, s&m, bestiality, incest, and a few other sexual proliferation's all get their time in the spotlight here. the problem is the storyline is so dull that the rampant sexuality gets pretty tedious after awhile. who knew that a film with an intimate goat/ girl encounter could be so damn boring? well now i do.eye candy: venessa hidalgo shows all; helga line provides t&a (both on display quite frequently); women viewers get the occasional penis.my grade: d+region 1 dvd extras: trailers for "pick up", "legend of eight samurai", "don't answer the phone", "prime evil", & "sister street fighter" (also the same dvd holds a second feature movie "evil eye")

i'm not ruining anything when i inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie. if that is your thing, then your movie has arrived.a woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods. her sister is a creepy lady to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. on the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan rituals.the plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb. the woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans, even continues the have sex with him. on the exploitative side of things, there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings, but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else. oh, and the aforementioned goat-sex scene.most viewers won't make it to the end. exploitation fans will ride it out, but will be left wanting more.4/10

this is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. it is simultaneously bland and offensive, with nudity and lots and lots of violence. however, the nudity is not that exciting, and the violence is repetitive and boring. also, the plot is flimsy at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen. i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's not. i did not laugh once while watching it, nor did i even crack a smile. the makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie, and they failed on both counts. some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.

ah yes the 1980s , a time of reaganomics and sly , chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . at the time i couldn`t believe how movies like rambo , missing in action and uncommon valor ( and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . troma`s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? of course not . troma`s war lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . maybe it is ?

this video is 100% retarded. besides the brain cell killing acting and plot, it's way too long. don't waste your money at the video store. i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it. just absolutely awful.

just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks, did i waste my money! hey, i dig adam "batman" west and tina "giligan's island" louise, but hello! this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films; crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town, beat up everybody and everything, and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero. adam west looks the part as a hero, but he's missing cape, and his batman uniform. sorry, just isn't the same. tina l. looks really nervous and frightened the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "ginger" once she was rescued from the island...lol! the bikers are a motley group, and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have. hell riders is hell to watch!

what else can you say about this movie,except that it's plain awful.tina louise and adam west are the reasons why to see this,but,that's it,but their talents are wasted in this junk.i think that they used a double in some of adam's scenes,like when he's running because you can't see his face.if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare,just think what he must've felt about appearing in this??? if it was before or after,i'm not sure,but,still,zombie nightmare is a classic(check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last)compared to this.the gang is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors.a rip-off of the wild one starring marlon brando,of course.tina looks stunning though.i hope her and adam got a good paycheck!! pass!

this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. even for a biker movie, it's rock bottom. the minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town (how original!) and the townspeople's attempts to fight them off. why don't they call for outside help? who knows? the fight scenes are obviously fake. adam west and tina louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there (understandably) this movie belongs in the trash heap!

i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment, but it was just boring. it appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends, and from there casually decided to make a movie. it is frequently unwatchable. lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. unfortunately, renee harmon is barely in the movie. harmon probably would have livened things up. perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed.of course, the bikers terrorize a small town. fights, murder, a cowardly cop, a goofy mechanic, etc. one of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws.the script has nothing to offer. one scene features a biker assaulting a woman, yelling in the lady's face "you're all the same! you're all the same!". we come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares "you're all the same!". couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say??at the end the good guys have killed the bad guys. we also learn that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic joe and young susie has been canceled. susie is going away to college, and we abruptly learn that joe's wedding is still on (but with a different bride). end.

how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film. tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason seems truly frightened. i can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public. also, i'm a fan of the likable adam west. again, as with tina, adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age. his acting here is passable, but the script is so bad, that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog.the movie is a rip-off of the classic brando biker flick, the wild ones; out-law biker gang is out-of-control in a small hick-town. the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister. the acting is stiff and wooden, and the story-plot is as old as sand. hellriders is hell to watch!

this has to be the worst, and i mean worst biker movie ever made! and that's saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and smelly!now at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from gilligan's island! a frightened looking tina louise(she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!)is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history. but, don't worry fans! batman, i mean adam west as a hick-town doctor comes to the rescue! pow! crush! boom! holy toledo batman! the only good points of this "bomb" are some cute women, some laughable fight scenes, and the still "sexy" tina louise!

i saw this dull waste of time on hbo's comedy channel, so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. but there is absolutely nothing funny here. a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century inquisition torturers. the first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue i've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta-jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast, but that's about it.this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.

be warned: neither zeta-jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe. their roles are in fact minor.the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, with neither being really engaging. especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé. the plot drags terribly, and i turned this one off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, as i like to finish what i start. the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars.2/10

i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move. it wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious. the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible. it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. terrible movie with a surf "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now, being married with gordon gekko and all, but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time. a bad movie with great surfing, real surfers and amazing, beautiful cinematography was in god's hands.

the only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.the story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. j.c. (sean pertwee) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend chloe (catherine zeta jones). just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the bone yard. the trouble is, there are no waves until the very end of the film, so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.the acting is mostly mediocre. sean pertwee has a few comical moments, but mostly his acting was mundane. ewan mcgregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch. probably the funniest performance was turned in by peter gunn as terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag. catherine zeta-jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability.there is really not much here on which to comment. i rated it a 3/10. it's a real beach bummer.

note to self- just because a film is foreign, obscure, and stars catherine zeta-jones doesn't mean it's any good. such is the case with 'blue juice,' a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem (to a dumb american, anyway) an even more unlikely place to find surfers: cornwall, england. you might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing, quirky little comedy. if only. the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable. the easiest way to describe it is as a sort of '90's british version of 'grease' without the dancing, but even that makes it sound better than it is. no, the best way to take it is as a little slice-of-life set in a small town. catherine zeta-jones plays chloe, a young woman living with a surfing instructor, jc (sean pertwee; you remember him). pertwee is actually the film's star, and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees, the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this. in this case, it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist, a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer, and a fat nerdy guy who, in a needlessly extended scene, gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him. i can't honestly say everything that goes on in 'blue juice' is predictable, since it's set in a place and reflects customs and manners i'm not very familiar with, but there's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters. the comedy, though, is very predictable and tired. one can sense the set-ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue (in american form, of course) before the actors do. the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed. she wants him to grow up; he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being. he's afraid of losing face with his gang; she thinks he prefers them to her. you get the idea. as i struggled to stay focused on 'blue juice,' toward the end i felt, as the saying goes, that this was an hour and half of my life i'd never get back.

a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and cornwall. sean pertwee is the real star of this film, while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal.for those who don't like surfing or cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in.only ewan, sean and catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape, which is why it was only released on videotape in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame.

god this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved, i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film, it is a waste of time.emraan can act but was really pathetic in this film, i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it was just really bad.celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever, she can't act at all, and there was no point of her being in this film, as for the other girl radha she was okay i guess but could have done better.what a waste of time. please buy the great music and don't watch this movie.

okay the promos promised a comedy and people(few) went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing, or for that matter of any year, because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some moreokay coming to jawani diwanireview in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it's annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina jaitleycringeworthy dialogues, comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholesdirection is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here, luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost it's touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible

this movie was absolutely pathetic. a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead. i couldn't even sit through the whole movie. emran hashmi disappoints, and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all. celina jaitley was not bad. the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris. it was pretty hilarious. the songs "sini ne" and its remix version were really good. you can always count on emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. all in all, it seems emran doesn't have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time.

this movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled. kamal hasan has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right, pity he did not spend more time on the plot. most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason.overall very disappointing, i would recommend avoiding this movie.

i would of given this film a zero out of ten, but i will give it a two. reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal. i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal, but its no big deal. anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, lets actually talk about this film. is it good or bad, i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn. me being a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review's by clicking on my name, i have great taste. the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema, why is there no morale in this movie. its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks. watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, man cant kiss properly anyway.

now don't get me wrong, i do enjoy christmas movies. i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular movie is awful. i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful. albert finney sings fairly well in annie. i don't know whats wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this movie for us was shutting the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd.

i couldn't not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here -- it's that bad). this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ("thank you very much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again.the only entertaining part of this movie (completely unintentional by the way) involves alec guinness as jacob marley. dressed in a silly powder white costume, guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie. albert finney, meanwhile, blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo/scrooge. finney's scrooge is so hideous a person, it's impossible to believe his transformation.steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs.

this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen. they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.the songs rarely move along the story. they seem to be thrown in at random. the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous.it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen, but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen.it's probably only considered a classic because "a christmas carol" is such a classic story. just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is.

this wasn't really a very good movie. there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film...but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. this movie was produced by magic johnson! isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film? a film produced by a former nba star doesn't come along every day, you know. beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho. every cliché trotted out for us to groan over. teen sex. and it was all produced by magic johnson! i can't say enough about this movie! teen drug use! college hijinx! and it was all produced by magic johnson! yippeeee!

i was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror.to my disappointment, this turned into more of a comedy than a horror. the acting, dialog, and flow of the movie was all very poorly done. much of it didn't make sense. for example, there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard. i kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - emphasis on try.the blood and gore are also poorly done. i've seen halloween costumes look more believable than this. a guy with his head cut clean off... looked clean - missing signs bone, flesh, blood, and even the head. a strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax.revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist, but contradicted other parts in the story. what was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that? if there was going to be a twist, you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense.

i'm sorry to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. the acting is bad, even wooden, it over-hypes the fright-factor early on, and doesn't exactly work. i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end, but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing. what the hell? the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted? try again.its hardly original, and it isn't even particularly good as a straight slasher. and that's saying something.i think whoever did the castings, whoever wrote the script, and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported.don't watch this movie. if someone puts this on at a party, throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie, like silence of the lambs or the shining.

here we go with other slasher movie, good looking people and acting from everyone was really good!few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 years after they are still friends, they go to huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (no nudity) for least half a hour of the movie! again they start making pranks phone call all over again! and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend movie,deaths scene really weird, really odd times too.nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointlessthe twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 4/10

when i caught a glimpse of the title i thought are we going to get another try-hard hip slasher, but actually i found "7eventy 5ive" to be a mildly passable, and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid-section it picks up momentum for the final half-hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending. it won't win awards for originality, because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills (usual cheap jump scares), location (secluded mansion) and motivation from other films. the gleaming direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script. sometimes laughable, but nonetheless i was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe. the performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast, however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing. an always presentable rutger hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective. a slickly made, but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold.

what an utter disappointment! the score of 6,1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but, oh my, was i disappointed. the first thing that bugs me are those braindead, stereotyped university kids. yes, i know teens can be childish and so on, but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons? there was one character that i thought was alright, but he/she (not revealing it here) was killed off way before the end. the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero/heroine just didn't do it for me. on the plus side: the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks. the acting was generally not very good, rutger hauer stands out in a small role. but it all fails with bland and braindead characters. you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and thats being generous).

the plot of 7eventy 5ive involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly (to them, if not to fans of horror) gets them in over their heads. the story of 7eventy 5ive, on the other hand, is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise, sadly outweighed by really bad writing.what could have been a fun, if somewhat silly, old-fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers' misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud, whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film's running time. with the exception of a police detective played by rutger hauer, (in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie's only star power) every character on screen is a different breed of young a-hole.male and female, black and white, straight and gay, an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film's narrative. worse, since the tale deals with a party game gone awry, most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b*****ds. because of this, there are few breaks for the viewer, who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly-drawn protagonists. even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends, invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner, long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen. this leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film: the audience, intended to care about the leads, instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer, but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier.the real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7eventy 5ive actually did have some potential. visually it's fine. first-time directors brian hooks and deon taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood. they also manage to deliver on some competent, if sparse, moments of classic 80s-style gore. surprisingly, the production's cast is also fairly able. it isn't that the actors aren't capable of expressing realistic human emotion; it is simply that the screenplay (co-written by newcomer vashon nutt and director hooks, who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) is short of such moments.7eventy 5ive can hardly be recommended, as its familiar premise and few thrills can't outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters. in this tepid whodunnit, the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who can't even manage to like each other.

saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du monde in montreal. what a disappointment. this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans. the acting was only but regular. the directing didn't bring anything new or interesting. the plot lacks considerably : the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls(7eventy 5ive). and on top of that, you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes. if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie, you might like it. if you don't, this movie is not worth it.

5 minutes into this movie i was hyperventilating, shaking, and writhing in pain. and not in the good way. the story is about a troupe of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea. turns out psychos don't like prank phone calls because in 2 minutes time he's at their door killing poor williams mom and dad. well skip ahead 15 years and guess what? still prank phone calling people. yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of deterred them from doing that ever again but no. so after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs i realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life. this piece of crap isn't even worth laughing at the shoddy production, the "acting", or rutger haurs dwindling career. i love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece i've ever seen. just don't.

i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend, and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie...any movie. and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget, we decided to go in for that.big mistake. this is a movie that might appeal only to kids. oh, and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience. but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention. if you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. better than wasting hard-earned cash on this. go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid :)

in keeping with disney's well-known practice of stealing.. i mean.. buying out known properties and bastardizing them, this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes. i grew up on the original cartoon tv series. any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie. not present is penny's cool computer book. also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief. new are a smooth talking gadget convertible (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic hollywood romance. don't fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their _ex_executives - don't see this movie.

disney's done it again. the company that made "mr. magoo" and "george of the jungle" has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and keeps none of the spirit of the original."inspector gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when i was a young one, and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then. now that that movie does exist, i was severely disappointed, even outraged.first we have the characters.gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon (with well-done special effects accompanying them), and he even has some of the naivete of the original gadget, but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while penny and brain just watch.penny has little to do; while she played a major role in the cartoon, discovering the crime and halting it, and occasionally getting captured by the mad agents, now she is simply introduced and then forgotten, although she does at least sneak into claw's base.claw is the movie's version of dr. claw, who was a rather sinister, raspy-voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view, as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes. now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand, with no mystery behind the character.brain and mad cat exist in the movie, but are rather insignificant to it.even small parts of the cartoon aren't spared in this butchering. the famous expression "wowsers!" was mysteriously changed to "wowser", and gadget's gadgetmobile now looks different and talks.there is even product endorsements everywhere. why is "yahoo!" advertised on a sign? why does the gadgetmobile have buttons for m&m's or skittles?fans of the cartoon will hate it, others might will likely find the movie below par, and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show.

inspector gadget (1999) **starring: matthew broderick, rupert everett, joely fisher, andy dick, dabney coleman director: david kellogg 80 minutes rated pgby blake french:disney's new film, "inspector gadget" is about a cop named john who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine-like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says "go go," only to be called inspector gadget!the actual movie's structure is much like the body formation of inspector gadget himself. it is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present. the film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6-9 would enjoy.the cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by matthew broderick, who, until "inspector gadget," was on a success spree with movies like "election." his character becomes inspector gadget after an encounter with the film's heavy handed villain named claw. he is played by rupert everett, who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful "william shakespeare's a midsummer nights dream."there is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving inspector gadget's wacky body parts and mechanism elements. it has gadget and claw drooling over the attractive character brenda, played by joely fisher, for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father, who was earlier killed by claw. competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. also a major character is the gadget mobil, a life like automobile that is devised for inspector gadget himself. it is voiced by d.l. hughly from the sitcom comedy "the hughly's.""inspector gadget" is a movie that i found quite bad. i know, i am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers, but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking. the movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. i never found myself caring about the characters. there is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 film, "mr. magoo," which opened using clips of the original cartoon. is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy-which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing. the overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke: inspector gadget's bumbling goofiness.in movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries-something to help make out what can happen and what can not. in "inspector gadget" there are no such boundaries. this is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors, who surly had lots of fun. i am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called "blankman" which again, contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props, but it too lacked something needed for every movie: audience participation.a character that i found being left out a lot is gadgets daughter, who by the end of the movie, i still has not clue of what her name was. she is used only as a plot device-and i question how she was used to further the plot as well. for her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. we never know her reactions to her father's operation or accidents. thus, this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.in closing, i'd like to state that "inspector gadget" is an awful, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. and believe it or not, i find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti-young audience action picture "blade." i am stating once again that i had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens. "inspector gadget" had so much going for it at the same time, it made literally made me dizzy.

ok. i think the tv show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved. so, when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, i decided to tag along. i wish i'd stayed home and watched the tv show instead.the fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie. the plot is next to non-existant, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and, worst of all, gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever. it appears that disney took all of the things that make inspector gadget work on tv and tossed them all. to be fair, my younger child (8 years old) liked the movie but the older one (10 years old) came away thinking it silly (he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor).generally, i like disney films but this one misses by a mile. it is ok for a very narrow age band (say 7 to 9) but a must miss for everybody else.

gwyneth paltrow is absolutely great in this movie, but the story is, unfortunately, half-baked, and david schwimmer's energy is sort of like cold mush. when he closes his mouth and gets serious for a moment or two there is a rush of what-might-have-been. who thought 25-year-old kiddies would be entertaining?

in a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more. it wants to be harold and maude, annie hall, the graduate. it wants to be deep and human. it has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. the dialog is smart -- at times. there are some "laugh out loud" moments.but here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: 1. david schwimmer -- how many times can joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? maybe some drool would have helped.2. gwenneth paltrow -- she's really flat here and not just in the chest. her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like schwimmer has any chance with her. but gwenneth plays her very dull. combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.(i kept picturing someone else in this role -- kate hudson for example.) 3. the script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said "oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!" so they pulled out the hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.

when his in-laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs, a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend, forced to take the rap by the gang, to tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way.the decoy is a real-life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films! it's talky, illogical, slow, and ultimately very boring.there's some good costumes, sets, and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer/director/producer/star justin kreinbrink, who apparently had too much money on his hands.they used to make westerns like this, that were under an hour long. trim this of about half it's length and you might have something watchable.

from the opening dialog and scenes, i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck. didn't want to look, but couldn't turn away. if it weren't for the meer eye candy of this film, i would have given one star. the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched, added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film. but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.if you were stuck out in the woods, your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do?a.) run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. b.) have sex with your friends girlfriend. c.) take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. d.) bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel. e.) all of the above.according to eli roth, none of these answers are that far fetched. in fact, all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever. the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store. stay away. stay far away.

no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed. i wish i could get my time back. nice skull face broad really smiles, bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script. i was ((spoiler)) happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end, especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset. eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten, putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption. overall, i found most of it pointless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the demise of cast, in a way though, wishing that journey never happened (probably should've been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night, ugh).

sure i've seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater. i wanted my money back. i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket, of course i didn't receive a refund (or even a reply) but it's the point that matters. on a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a -42. why did the "jeep" (chevy blazer??) stop running from being hit with a bat? why did they hit the "jeep"(chevy blazer?????) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum's skull? the plot was thin, the movie filled with obvious clichés, and certain parts of it just didn't make any sense.

this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus. suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves."cabin fever" is a horrible film. for one, it tries to be many genres at once. is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? nobody can tell. there's a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. when the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. i liked the ending a lot.but apart from the ending, i was pretty disappointed and disgusted. the violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. the tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. in fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. what are we supposed to get from that? this same girl would bite one of the characters. was that supposed to be funny? i don't know.some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. i didn't care for most of the characters. i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. as a horror film, i didn't know what it was trying to be. i didn't find it funny, tense, nor scary. by the end, you're left indifferent, thinking, "what have i just been through?" unfortunately, you'll never know the answer to that question.

there's a major difference between releasing an original, intense, edge-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing like filmmaker eli roth and his team have done with "cabin fever" and simply acted like it. the film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, flesh-eating disease. it's not long before the friends turn on one another, and can barely stand the sight of one another, much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. as gross as it all sounds, there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director roth. this is sloppy film-making in several ways! avoid this time devourer.

don't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot. i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re: death on the nile. everyone has done this one! we know who dies. we know why they die. we know who the killer is. we know how it was done. so i say enough already! mr. suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels. i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. the sets were terrific and very realistic. i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. somehow i don't think so. i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms. christie wrote it that way. i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison!

got into this flick, just as it was beginning, on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu - otherwise i'd have missed it. that probably would have been best.i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas - both very good performers - and thought this might be worth a look. it proved to be to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinates.zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talents, except for her jayne mansfield- or loni anderson-like bosom. unfortunately, her acting prowess - at least here - makes mansfield and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison.the young nut case's white rat, the owner's cat, the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home, and a bunch of doophus's (including the young nut case) running around a bio hazard facility, and the absurd conclusion. i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism, believability or being capable of evoking some empathy/sympathy -- but this proved to be in vain.

there was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film(zoe mclellan) but even her looks couldn't stop me from voting it the lowest possible - one.the plot is bad and irrational.what more can i say. the movie sucks.

this lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity.here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce, helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. she has even started up a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger perhaps, landscape architect / gardener (who's black). but then horror of middle-aged women's horrors, another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to, starts 'taking over" her life.what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener, and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! and backed up the toilet! and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! and hangs her pieces of (african) artwork in the living room!! and so on. well she may have killed the cat as well. yeah, ok, the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough, but its more than a little ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (so why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors, a much younger woman?)supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking, of course) 20 something. but there's this problem. anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. (well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. it just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.)the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things, and the 20 something has had help. the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending, the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. you know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. finally the 40 something's "heroic" battle back for the house then begins. woopie!!the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative), when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. (this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime.the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic, and isn't taking her medicine. even so it makes no sense. she isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband, though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. she's after the house (technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce, after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband!! (the ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter, he still strayed!!!)the protagonist is good enough looking for her age. but her outlook, attitude and focus is so small minded, frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. well, a core group of lifetime fans care, i guess, judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. i couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.)** spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick).well, here's a clue. the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to "listen to" her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover, and "do whatever he says" and "let him take care of her" (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to the house. there she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something, who is taking a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. there's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. she then begins stroking her, mom like, and the two women have a bonding, female solidarity moment!!! how sweet.

anyone who's watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table. so, when crazed lara moves into patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers, i didn't even blink. when lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor patti, and dares her to do anything about it, i just nodded. you see, on planet lmn, people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. only on planet lmn could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers!! poor patti - she just trusted too much, and lara went off her medicine, and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone's tummy, and a body bag going out the front door. the horror!but take it from me, this planet lmn product is a classic. you need to watch it once, just for the great laughs you'll have. on the improbability scale, i give this film a 95/100. make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices, too. you'll understand later.

this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen. this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility (like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon), and the bad acting. it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. however, the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box, does so at the same time a bank heist is going down, at the same fbi agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one. however, the results do not make for an enticing action film, but instead, one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film). what the hell ron perlman was doing in this, i have no idea. i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it.

mr perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). sadly, he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces.larsen is in "die hard" mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles, i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.the lovely erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of "getting" acting at last.sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies.the shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the a-teamnot even worth seeing for perlman - avoid

wonderful actors. lousy script and not too great direction either. my main problem was i simply didn't care about any of these people. not the killer not the victims. the settings were pretty drab. dennis quaid's character was so poorly written in, i didn't even care when the end came. he got his kid back. big deal! i wanted my money back.

i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly. danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had. i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. i'd watch it again though. i rated it a 5 (wish i could rate it a 5.5)

i didn't mind the film that much, but it was incredibly dull and boring. a few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for. you should give it a go if you like silly, stupid humour because this is the film for you.

this may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and i want it back!chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies. some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. there's not much middle ground in this category. although chris farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not so funny, and then dead...so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career.avoid this movie like the plague.c

chris kattan is a great sketch actor on saturday night live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. he plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. wanna know the only funny parts? the stuff they showed in the previews. yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. nothing else is. especially when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one. and yet, his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad. this movie made me develop an eye twitch. avoid it at all costs, and keep watching snl.

admittedly, i didn't have high expectations of "corky romano." but then again, who did? however, i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt. i had no high hopes of "joe dirt" either--another recent comedy starring an snl cast member--and i ended up being pleasantly surprised. but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews. chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor--contrary to what you might think after watching this movie--with great energy. he's been in many hilarious snl skits, and i think he's one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now. in this case, he's given a lame, pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging. throughout each scene, he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably. jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy, not to mention he worked with much better writing. kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes. he doesn't even wait for the punchline; he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack. in one scene, he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth. the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him. he comes back to the job, strung out on coke. now, how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on-edge, when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film? as for the rest of the cast members...vanessa shaw is really hot, peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn. peter falk is also wasted, though he has a few funny lines that i'm pretty sure he improvised. i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon. that's too much talent too waste on a clunker like "corky romano." i didn't like falk's last movie "made" all that much either, but at least he had a decent role. i chuckled a few times, but i could not get a single laugh. each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery. and it's made worse by kattan's hammy acting. and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out. for example, when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers' faces. he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes, trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one. it's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out, but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse. and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust. i can go on and on about what's wrong with this so-called comedy, but i'm not gonna waste my time. like i said earlier, if you predicted bad things from the trailers--you predicted right. my score: 3 (out of 10)

unfortunately, this movie is so bad. the original out of towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by neil simon. for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. even the audience i was with never laughed. the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. the couple having sex in the park. they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie & steve do a bit of slap stick. the whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. you will also notice every close up of goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis, that's if you want to laugh.

bruce lee was a great martial artist, but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made. it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air. it just gets downright absurd from then, like something out of a cheap comic book. maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view. there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there, usually all made in hong kong. i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera. even steven seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong. 'game of death ii' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion, despite bruce lee being in it.

i found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow "upbeat" ending that didn't ring true to the overall story. following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and i got very tired of its "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end--in fact i almost stopped about halfway through. the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and i love good, small films! this one just didn't jell, though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. i was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "year's 10 best" list. i'd strongly recommend watching "the house of sand" instead--now there's a good, small film!

this is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief. as such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters. however, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. the camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, disjointed effect. most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met). the storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. in sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing. in spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.

something i really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in "living with happiness." this film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue, patchy performances and very television coverage.it's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. but the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much.i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity.

the film had some likable aspects. perhaps too many for my taste. it felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters. not once, a few times...but all of the time. this is the job of television, not cinema. the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler's performance as the pregnant friend. i felt as though justine clarke's performance was wan. her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions. i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence. i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences. this is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest. that said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality. it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm. i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked. "who knows if there's a god? like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line was. perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife "i'm giving up smoking." an anti-smoking commercial? a tac ad with some tasteful animation? i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much.

i am currently sitting here, forcing myself to finish this. i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs, might as well suffer for it. i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for "war of the worlds" cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time, and i missed the old tv series from the early 90's. the website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book. it was going to be a "perfect translation". perfect crap is more in tune with this film.first off, the video on this movie was glitched! it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid-90's pc or playstation cd-rom video game. sadly enough, the color quality was similar. the acting made shatners classic "dramatic pause" look damn near shakespearean in quality. the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes.secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. i sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien. after that, the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid. i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm. the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's. the last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's no one is concerned for their life. it's like they have no concept. even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. the "illusion" of day and night was shoddy at best. simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify night time. perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion. there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the "hero" gallop around or walk down silly roads. get on with the film. i know how people get around, you do not need to be so in-depth.now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects. even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. the animations do not match up to the scenery at all.in closing folks, if you want "the war of the worlds", do one of four things. 1) watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's tv series, 3) wait for spielberg's rendition to be released shortly, or 4) read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary english class). avoid this movie. it is a waste of your money.

normally when i write a review for a movie online, it is for one of three reasons. either, i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, i feel that the public's perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as, "this is one of the best films of all time!", does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. with that being said, war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggy-backing its loathsome carcass on the multi-million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg. many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. this movie is not even "so bad" that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i. judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film (i found it as sam's club for 8 bucks), i assumed that the cast would be no-names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular. check. this is not a big deal for me, as i find a large budget and an over-reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie. i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score. check again. what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien/battle scenes. now, as per imdb's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. the movie opens with a lot of inane small-talk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camera-work, spliced scenes, and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. however, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. the next 30 minutes basically go as follows: one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. they both walk back to town. these walks aren't two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. in a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says "thank you mary" to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. i apologize for the extreme run-on sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere. the editing is mind-bogglingly bad. people actions make little sense. for instance, when the professor goes to a farmer's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. i have seen better high school video productions. finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. however, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. avoid this film at all costs.

my children watch the show everyday that its on. its a great program for younger children. however they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooney's and deedee's yellow teeth. moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth? does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at. and one other thing if we might be able to add. moe you need to stop hiding so much. sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope? what does that signify? other then getting wet all the time. they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole. kids loose interest that way.

you don't expect much from a prc picture, and with rare exceptions--mainly from edgar g. ulmer and a few by joseph h. lewis or lew landers--that's exactly what you get: not much. this "epic" about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isn't much different. the script, by longtime prc hacks arthur st. claire and sherman lowe, is trite, laughable, full of unfunny "wisecracks" and plot holes the size of outer mongolia. the direction, by longtime prc no-budget specialist al herman, is semi-comatose at best. the performances, though--except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf king--aren't really half bad. veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film. he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razor-blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up. he's got great comic timing, charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time. duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheik--despite his spanish accent--and veteran bad guy george j. lewis as renaldo's arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy, even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes. joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch, and she and renaldo have great chemistry together, although--like the rest of the cast--she has none at all with king. h.b. warner, whose career stretched back to the silent era, lends a shred of dignity to the low-rent proceedings, even though he blows his lines several times and, prc being prc, they weren't cut out. there's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big-budget silent movie with a similar arab theme--although i have no idea which one it is--and, prc being prc, no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous: i've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious."a yank in libya" isn't very good, of course--well, ok, it stinks--but it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime. i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor/director albert brooks and super dave osborne, but had never actually seen him in anything before. it was worth watching this tenth-rate prc "extravaganza" just to see him in action. otherwise, forget it.

woman (miriam hopkins as virginia) chases man (joel mccrea as kenneth) for father (charles winninger as b.j.). woman wants to get man to invest some of deceased mother's money in father's business venture; but, father is notorious for losing money on hair-brained schemes. little does anyone know, but real evil schemers are posing as man's best friends in order to steal his fortune...the production looks engaging, but the story fails to engage. the players don't play drunk well. notable as broderick crawford's first appearance - as gopher "hunk"; other than running errands, mr. crawford gets pinned to the floor by mr. mccrea. *** woman chases man (4/28/37) john g. blystone ~ miriam hopkins, joel mccrea, charles winninger, broderick crawford

it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before.it was absolutely predictable.every time the story tried to get a bit twisted,every time i awaited something interesting to happen, i saw nothing but what i expected. like "the bread factory opened up another facility,because there was not enough bread". in two words:flat story,that has become a cliché,bad acting,bad special effects...only the dumb russian cop,vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.the pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid,that it made me laugh at him for a moment. i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie... it won't get worse (because it is not possible) :d

this movie is a vehicle for schwarzenegger-clone alexander nevsky. his charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script. he has little to add to his arnie-act.michael york is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat. watching him revisit his d'artagnan-act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy. come on, you can do better than that!the story is full of holes and unexplained relations; top of this bill is the informer of vlad, who sounds like an american woman, but from the context appears to be working for a russian government-department.although the story takes place well after the end of the communist-regime, all the russian characters are still very communist-like. in contradiction to that, vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police-car. the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics.not a must see movie...

but it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting. nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn't all that attractive, in fact, imo, he is ugly. ( his acting skills lack everything! ) sascha is played very well by joanna pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. there are way too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and way too dumb of an ending. it is very violent. i did however love the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that is a bonus. i also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. the actors needed to be more handsome...the biggest problem i had was that nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. i think for most guys, sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies that are fans of action, nevsky just doesn't cut it. overall, this movie was fine, i didn't love it nor did i hate it, just found it to be another normal action flick.

a retired diplomat, played nicely by michael york, goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. there the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice.i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous u.s. government. it's interesting to see this time the russian guy as a hero.not a great flick, it's really typically a "b" action flick. michael york lends some class to this mediocre movie. alexander nevsky, who plays the russian cop is kind of "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york. face it, michael york is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. disappointingly, the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. now, if adrian paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average "b" action flick. all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. the villain, played by richard tyson, is your typical bad guy. he's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch. it's okay. it doesn't suck too bad. the action scenes are decent. the acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what russia looks like today!

this was a quite brutal movie. there were huge implausibilities, and a silly script, bad acting, etc.the only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed.

this is only somewhat attractive for fans of "bad movie" entertainment. it is more worthwhile for students of 1970's pop culture: the fashions, the furniture, the attitudes, and that great "women's lib" moment of the early 1970's, when it was still fresh and novel for a self-employed, independent woman to exist."superchick" (joyce jillson) had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career (after all, what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30,000 feet -- that goes for the male ones too), she slept around with multiple men, could protect herself and others (with karate) and wasn't tied down to anything. this is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband.the "sexy stewardess" was a potent archetype of the late 1960's to 1970's, (geez, even on "the partridge family," i remember swinging bachelor ruben kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses) and from that point of view, this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre-aids, free-love, women's lib, swinging seventies. the plot is quite awful though. and for those cavemen in the audience, there are few bare breasts to look at.

suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s tv hit "love, american style," decked out with flashes of nudity, "superchick" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. and the lead character here, tara b. true, really is some kind of superchick. a stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the "lay" in "layover." what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york, her playboy with gangster problems in miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l.a., tara sure does keep busy. and when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. as i said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. future astrologist joyce jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. disappointingly, buxom '70s faves uschi digard and mary gavin (aka candy samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and i suppose that is something. strange that the end credits should call attention to ms. jillson's body double, however; don't think i've ever seen that before!

the name "cult movie" is often given to films which continue to be screened, or to sell in home movie format, more than a generation after they were first released. superchick, which was first released in 1973, now comes into this category. its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film.despite the "superwoman" connotation, "superchick" is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess - a career option which in the 1970's was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl, and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port. since she holds black belt status in karate, she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence, and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers. this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce. its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners, the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy.superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing. it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time; despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come. however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4/10.

this show stinks. for parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. it is usually educational, funny, and bright.is it educational? no. the doodlebops sing and that's it. they usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.is it funny? no. the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.is it bright? it's so bright, it's painful. as far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop's. therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.the show is also extremely cheesy. every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. it's overkill.for kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. they'll never know how to grow up.

this was an awful movie. basically jane march was a half-korean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea. she becomes a maid for an american military family, they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white (i believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 southeast asian, not at all korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. the way korea and the u.s. military in korea is depicted is completely insane. of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie. anyone who's ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage. in the end the north korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in an obvious "paying for her sins" way. very bad film with a made-for-tv feel to it.

i saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and i hadn't seen an almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.or so i thought. then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details, like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.great, but you know what? it's still a bad movie. it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film--you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. high heels gives us strange, off-beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point. what is the significance, for example, of the hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? why is that even in there? just to surprise us?there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. and that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. the rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart pedro almodovar is. but no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be good.

high heels are tricksy things. they can elevate women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedy. tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of plot it's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. a few moments of comedy aside, tacones lejanos just isn't interesting. the best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child. from this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel.there's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish, arty direction that you'd expect from almodóvar, but otherwise tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of spanish cinema. with a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse. instead it's poor. high heels stumbles for sure.

david lean's worst film. even 'in which we serve' was'nt as bad as this. usually a film with a really good reputation like this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945! i disliked the acting, stiff upper lip british mannerisms, story, script (which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive, but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice. just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation. another very overrated 'british classic'.

i recently saw the broadway revival of "blithe spirit" starring angela lansbury, rupert everett, christine ebersole, and jayne atkinson. it's a terrific production, and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect. angela lansbury is extremely funny as madame arcati.it was probably a mistake, then, to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison. the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production."blithe spirit" is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. the actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't get in a movie house, or with a dvd showing, where the audience is separated from the story by the "fourth wall." the story: charles condomine (rex harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife ruth (constance cummings) in a house in the english countryside. seeking information for his next book, a book dealing with the supernatural, charles invites madame arcati (margaret rutherford, reprising her role from the original 1941 london production), a local spiritual medium, over to his house to conduct a séance. charles believes that spiritism is a sham, but hopes to pick up "the tricks of the trade." but then madame arcati brings back the ghost of elvira (kaye hammond), charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. elvira refuses to leave, and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles (complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira).on stage, the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation. but on the screen, the actors in "blithe spirit" tear through the lines as if they don't know that anyone is listening to them. they mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage. the performances by harrison, cummings, and even kaye hammond are flat and lifeless. only margaret rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as madame arcati.the oscar-winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive -- not just by today's standards, but by the standards of 1946! they consist mostly of kaye hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting. but compare the dull visual effects of "blithe spirit" to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney's "song of the south" -- which was eligible for awards the same year. in "south," humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time. compared to "south," the oscar that "blithe spirit" received for special effects was completely undeserved.at any rate, i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it closes. as for the movie with rex harrison, skip it.

the title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but i would like to welcome alone in the dark to the short list of real candidates: plan 9 from outer space, battlefield earth, and the adventures of pluto nash.as i watched the 90 minute bore i found it difficult to even stay awake even while i was trying so hard to laugh at the film. but alas i felt alone in the dark (i was gonna try to avoid the pun but i couldn't resist) as i looked around hoping to see mike nelson and his two robot friends. alas my friends and i had to provide comedy throughout the film.so... about the film itself. lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. the film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the xenos in aliens (they even call them xenos), and the creatures in pitch black. the can turn invisible at random (and i assure you it is random) and get hurt by light. also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. all of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. the action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. people shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.and those were the high points. the story revolving around a paranormal investigator (slater) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater tshirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. an archaeologist (reid) who is rather inept. and a government agent(dorff) whose lines involve barking order. all three should be ashamed at their performances (not that they have really ever done a good a job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. reid and slater are supposed to be lovers in the film i guess. the film contains the single most awkward love scene i have ever seen on film between the two.then comes the plot. quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. the rest is illogical at best. the plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. the film begins with text and a voice explaining the back-story. this opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. this opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. and the ending did not make one ounce of sense. not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.finally the direction of one uwe boll. disgrace, thats all that can be said. his use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. his lack of direction with the actors. just watch reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. the complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. and finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.i payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. and while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter i would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.shame on you uwe boll. shame on you tara reid. shame on you christian slater. shame on you stephen dorff. shame on anyone who was associated with this film.

this should be my kind of movie. even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, i like "congo," and "allan quatermaine" movies. i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place.1. horror/sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. i'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. super-natural enemies with quality fx. 4. christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy. 5. tara reid is hot.so this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do...i mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. but now on to some of the many faults.tara reid. even though the movie as a whole is worse, reid's performance is truly awful. we're not just talking bad, i'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year. i don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. i mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.even with reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd, otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time. the storyline jumps back and forth from slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, i guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs i zoned out during. the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a "chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities." i may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, slater and dorf to try to save everyone.jesus, i can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements. the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth. i mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. i guess he's infected? how did that happen? oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. how the hell did that happen? why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which "fuse" with the spine of their host)of course, slater is, like blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug "didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock," thank god. oh, and the people with these "fused" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. yeah we get zombies.so lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie.

tara reid as an intellectual, christian slater(usually great) as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff as...well it's stephen dorff for christ sake!!!! i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. you guys are on. heres an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices,a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, heres the clincher they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton. i knew you guys would love that. seriously though you owe me $7.50.

spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? could this be it? why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? why is this question never answered? why was the opening text crawl incoherent? why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver? why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? why does tara reid's character suddenly show up at christian slater's apartment for sex? (or did i just answer my own question?) why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? why would modern computers still display green pre-tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little "bleeps"? and must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? why doesn't anything in this movie make any sense?

honestly, i can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. what i will say is that, alone in the dark succeeds in only three things: 1. it will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.and3. it utterly disgraces the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.doctor boll, if that is indeed what you are (i'm thinking proctology here), what on earth are you doing in a director's chair?

i usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that i'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll, whose film right before this one was house of the dead (2003). like alone in the dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. almost everyone hated it. well, i loved it. i even gave it a 10 out of 10! my point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even i hated alone in the dark, there must be something wrong with it.the premise: who am i kidding? attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united states' budget, but here it goes anyway. some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe. the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the "second world", which was evil in nature. the bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.in fact, the exposition never really stops. it's like a neverending backstory from hell. there are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, starship trooper-like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, i can't remember if that last one was in the film. even more amazingly (amusingly?), in fangoria #240, producer shawn williamson was quoted as saying, "we're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that". tara reid called alone in the dark "a smarter film".let me not mislead anyone. a lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. i usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing (at least when each scene began). it's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés, as if director uwe boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. then when he was done, he and editor richard schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the i ching. sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel (which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work), but perhaps that's being too generous. i'm not sure boll would get work if this were his reel. just as i tend to at least like most films, i tend to like most actors and most performances. it's very rare that i say that a performance was bad. well, tara reid was bad here--and i'm someone who usually likes reid. i don't know what happened. for a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. they might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.and speaking of that dialogue, a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla. by that, i mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook. at least in godzilla films, there's a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there's a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.just what stephen dorff and christian slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say. i can't say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe slater at least saw the cigar. i think that's unprecedented for me.still, i didn't give this film a 1. there was some competent cinematography, even if boll and schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. heck, even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. i actually thought the film had promise at that point. but this may just be the worst film i've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.

the definition of an abomination as defined by webster's dictioary is "a cause of abhorrence or disgust." if someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for alone in the dark, please let me know because this is the best i can come up with. however, i do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.i went to see this film with two of my roommates. one has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action/adventure flick guru. this latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.that being said we entered the theater for the friday viewing of alone in the dark. little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. when it started i knew why immediately.it begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately i have to admit it only gets worse from there. the opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated. yet, i understand why it was narrated. the director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of paying to see this movie. yet, not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. it seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies. one is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. if you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone.then the awful storyline, acting, effects, and camera work begin. tara reid is horrendous as an actress. she does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator. slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with reid.the plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. the entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: what is this? and what is going on? other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by slater himself. are they good? no. do they explain anything? no. do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens? once again, no.then we have a random sex scene. we are told that slater and reid are together, yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another. but then bam...sex scene. once again i don't know.a good, oh i don't know, 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. this is set to a heavy-metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.and if that wasn't enough...there exists no main villain. there is the scientist and there are the "alien" things. at one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. why? how did he become the supreme commander of these things? why do they listen to him? once again i have no idea.the movie ends with slater and reid walking in an evacuated city. why was the city evacuated? did the alien things break through? did the military tell them? who knows...and by this point who cares? i didn't and you won't.but to top it off, slater and reid are attacked by an alien thing. even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. and thats right, you guessed it, it the middle of the *&%$ing day and it's bright as can be. maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, i don't know and i don't care.now after the movie ended i ran outside the theater, all 6 foot 6 inches of me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. even my gung-ho action/adventure roommate (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created) admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.to sum up this crap-fest i give it a 0.0/10 and would give it lower if i could.unequivocally, the worst movie ever made. i wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.

the minute the forward started, i knew we were in for trouble! the premise is laughable at best. the story line was even worse, if that is possible.the acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience. you expect more from the likes of slater, reid and dorff. lines were delivered as if from a robot. and i'm sorry, i like reid but she was very unbelievable as an archaeologist. slater and dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks. the continuity was off through out the entire film. the creatures weren't bad, but they really weren't good either. bottom line, i want that ninety minutes of my life back. they can keep the money, but give me the time! what a waste.

this movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. however this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. it almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. if you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. i can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that ed wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.to start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. on top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. then we meet mr. slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. soon we meet stephen dorff, who i typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. then comes the ultimate insult, tara reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! tara reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the american pie type. all in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, i know that i got a kick out of it, i mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.

well where do i begin my story?? i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.well i figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie. the plot was crap, and so was the script. the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.the cast couldn't have been more plastic looking. even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. very poor editing.all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. boo.

the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. it gives the basic summary of what is going on. this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is all you will learn about them. the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. i have never played the video game, but know people who have. from my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better. save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.

this mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations. sotd falls somewhere between "kung-fu" and "h r pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. if it weren't so long (nearly 3 hours) i think that kids would like it quite a bit. it's got adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes", and not too much romance or other "icky" stuff. when you're young, you're not too critical of flexing rubber swords, campy acting, and scenes that are repeated. (at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie, just as was done in old-time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed.) finally, kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors. (not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non-asian actors.) i was going to give this movie three stars, but i felt like the director, producers, and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project. this movie is not art, but, like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort, and discipline to get it made.overall, not a recommended use for your time, but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini-van.oh, yeah...hey, imdb! "dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. your spell-checking seems to think that "dialog" is the proper spelling. while "dialog" is acceptable, both webster's and the oed consider it an alternative form.

can i give this a minus rating? no? well, let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch. it was painful. boringus maximus. the plot(?) is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. i rented this film with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better, we decided to "fast forward" a little to see if things would get any better. it never gets better. this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, in reality, it is just a bore. nothing even remotely interesting ever happens. if you ever get the chance to watch this, do yourself a favor, try "plan nine from outer space" instead.

i expected a comedy like the "big mama" movies. instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story.this movie has three plots: the first involves madea and her taking in a foster child. the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father.there is actually very little comedy in the movie. there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. for example, madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. the child does, in fact, turn herself around. apparently, it pays to beat children.there are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). there are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (the ogling takes place at a family reunion.) the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama? it is, in fact, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.

i saw the movie last night here at home, but i thought it was too long first of all. second, the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before. the things isn't funny in the movie: fiancé hitting his girlfriend, beatings. the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry, you can do better then this!

the original show was so much better. they should have left on a good note. this movie killed the whole idea. it was boring, over-dramatic, and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack. this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious, and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel. not to mention, that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. so, sorry, tyler perry, but try harder next time. this movie is just kinda dull, and not that funny either. sorry. 4/10 stars is it.jay addison

i'm a black man living in a predominantly black city. that being said, i have some major misgivings about tyler perry's work. i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him, because he's black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture. but, i honestly do believe that, were perry white, this film would have had the naacp, al sharpton, and jessie jackson all over his ass.i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil. the characters are poorly written and acted. the jokes are so bad, i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny. i'm just going to break this big pile of sh-t down.madea=suck. the character may have had some appeal, but it doesn't anymore. when the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless. she is unnecessary.the situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesh-t. if a woman was so scared to death of her husband, why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed. wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. at any rate, the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't.then there are the two lovebirds. a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he's making his rounds. i couldn't believe it. i really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. but, what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch. i don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. morose victim and psycho momma. no matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was one constant. the bus driver wasn't going to get any. he even married her without sampling the goods--wtf! then there's the family reunion scene. here we've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos, grinding for the sake of grinding, shirtless, overly musclebound, b-ball, plus the great taste of maya angelou. when those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack. all this crap is going on at the reunion, in laughably easy to separate groups, and then they ring a bell. when they do, everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too, just like a pack of pavlov's doggies--wtf!! then you have the final five minutes of the film. in it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress. there is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling--wtf!!! the only reason to watch it this far, besides testing your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well. guess what, it doesn't happen. instead, perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe, ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness--wtf!! i'm pretty sure that, if given a day , i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks. don't even get me started on the rest of tyler perry's films. i'm just going to say this. in my opinion, as a black guy, d.w. griffith's legacy lives on. the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did, selling us down the river. i only wish perry's films were dudes so i could kick them in the nuts. thanks a lot, dude!! what are you going to follow this up with in 2009, a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in colonial america?

a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. the name of the female assassin is sawa. she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal, akai, who is sleeping with her. one day sawa finds out he killed her parents..------- even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest. "kite" has style, but it is still trash. the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on it's face. one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good/bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful. not only that, the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy.grade: 3/10

well, there's no real plot to speak of, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it's not in this case). what else can i say about this...? the action, when happening, is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there's not much to recommend "kite". watch it if you want, but you're not missing much if you skip this one...

(spoilers)i shoulda figured. the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was. i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen. this one is much worse. makes no sense. thrown together plot. all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them. it had to of been a student film. that musta gotten a c grade2/10quality: 1/10 entertainment: 6/10 (until i found out it wasn't going to end.) the ending made no darn sensereplayable: 0/10

the same night that i watched this i also watched "scary movie 4," making for one messed up double feature. unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise. while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud. how could i desire any more than that. director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers. but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day. the script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea. i, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato. and that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here. some may giggle, i did not. they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny, and i thought all hitler jokes were funny.the narrative of this film is so splintered (for no good reason) that it is nearly impossible to explain. tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia (three things that still control our lives today). oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really don't make much of an appearance. and when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes. that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks. there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny. the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here. man eats tomato and that's dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe. but that is just the way the world works. in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce (see: taco bell) becomes evil thanks to neglect. and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago. there are a few good chuckles to be had. the last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb. i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept, but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there. and by "there" i mean to the level of "scary movie 4." **1/4

with a title like "attack of the killer tomatoes!", anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. it's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody splashed in. unfortunately, it falls flat very soon.you're never supposed to take this movie seriously, i realize that, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (i.e, the side-by-side phone conversations, the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal, superman walking by lois, etc.). "attack of the killer tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't make it. a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "attack of the killer tomatoes" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film.there is one good actress in the entire thing: sharon taylor as lois fairchild. she is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to overact, and is a natural comedienne. unfortunately, she is put to bad use here."attack of the killer tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, "amazon women on the moon" or "kentucky fried movie", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so i would still recommend seeing it once. avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly "lost" footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect (it can be found in english on the out of print tape).

the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume: "can somebody please pass the ketchup?" i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative; it works better than an overdose of demarol.

never see this movie.it tries to be a spoof on scifi/thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it.it is very lame. a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it. this movie does not have any such aspect.save yourself. it's too late for me but... just don't watch it.

"attack of the killer tomatoes" consists mostly of rambling, poorly assembled footage in search of a movie. the plot makes no sense, and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all. watching this silly spoof, you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately: that it's easy to make a cheap, low-quality film and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (in one scene, female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them; how far can "suspension of disbelief" go - even in a parody?). the title song is great, though. (*1/2)

this movie's heart was in the right place, no matter where its brain was."attack" is basically a spoof a la "airplane!" (two years before the fact - nice going.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack.through all manner of film magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball-sized tomatoes at the on-screen actors), the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp. then, it's up to mason dixon (miller) and a group of spies i wouldn't wish on any government's side to save the day. of course there's a meddling reporter (taylor) who pops in at the worst times, dancing and singing army soldiers, japanese scientists with dubbed-in voices, some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword...and oh yeah, the san diego chicken before he made it big.the gags here aren't all that great. in fact, you could probably make up better yourself after watching these. some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ("please pass the ketchup" - not something to say in front of tomatoes.) and as far as "puberty love" goes...well, i can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.what's good about it? well, i liked the theme song and the beginning credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed. ...that's about it.three stars. not a "killer" comedy, but it tries.rock on, peace.

attack of the killer tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. the (very meager) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly. basically,they spin and growl (yes,they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. the actors are no-names who never made movies after this,so there would be no point to name them. there's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes. he's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government. if this isn't making much sense to you, you understand. this movie never would have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. the movie is horribly cheezy, which although being the whole point,really really hurts what could've been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. at one point, a giant wax tomato "slides" on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! maybe i would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value, but even this is lacking from this terrible movie. 2/10

i knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so i went into it with that expectation. i just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring. the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality. seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise. it could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch maybe, but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination.

awlright, damn it, the moocow will grudgingly admit the truth: i kinda' like this cheap, cheesy 70's parody. the idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the us is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large, obviously fake tomatoes. this film, along with the kentucky fried moovie, is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 80's & 90's, thanks largely to airplane!. this one, like moost spoofs, is pretty poor. many attempts at humor are dismal failures, and will induce much groaning. but thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes, the obnoxious "puberty love" song, and the awesome helicopter crash scene, attack of the killer tomatoes does provide some goods, though largely for the wrong reasons. there are sooooo many things wrong with this film...and so right, it's hard to explain. enough people must also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films, and a cartoon series!! large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull. and dig those 70's clothes, dude!! ;=8) this tomato is seedy and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; the moocow says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes!! :

yes, it can be done. john de bello and costa dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , sc-fi musical. if there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. every cheap cliché thought of is used. no doubt a fun movie to watch. worth a cold six-pack or two. point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. san diego is a good place as any to start. scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. this cult favorite features: david miller, eric christmas, al sklar, tom coleman, sharon taylor and john qualls.

i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. however, i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy. other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. however, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made a full movie, and a rather weak one at that.

when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it, i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.led by detective dick mason, a special team of military and scientists (including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt. finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind) 'attack of the killer tomatoes' is a parody of b-movies, in particular japanese horror of the 1950's. the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses! to be fair there are a couple of funny moments, for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent, or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey, can somebody please pass the ketchup?'. equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. unfortunately for 'attack of the killer tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'airplane' and 'naked gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.the acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy. for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre, even for this film. ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult one; i can't see many people being indifferent to it. unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up.

in case you're a self-acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie-making, there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch "attack of the killer tomatoes". it's an inescapable certainty, as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made. one tiny but essential detail, however, is that "attack of the killer tomatoes" is deliberately awful. right from the opening message already, mocking alfred hitchcock's "the birds", this is clearly intended as a zero-budgeted parody and i can't escape the impression that writer/director john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit. the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so-called "eco-horror" movies (plants, animals and nature in general revolting against humanity) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines. a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato-attacks coming from all over the country. the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy, which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices. the first half hour of "attack of the killer tomatoes" is very entertaining. as silly as it is, the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny. the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song, the "jaws" homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash (see the trivia section for more details) that made it to the final cut. after that, however, the whole thing turns into a tedious, unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess. the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots. personally, i prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels (which i saw before seeing the original) because they benefit from slightly better production values, incredibly over-the-top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin ("the addams family") as the mad scientist dr. gangreen. but, as said before already, the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life.

the easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. the target of the satire is quite vast, from the us government to corporate america. it is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.think of this movie as a mix between the kentucky fried movie, airplane and police squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. i can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's. i see this movie as a big influence on tim burton's mars attacks.the plot is simple enough. genetically engineered giant tomatoes go "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. at first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.the movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : lois "fairchild" (a lois lane clone), a very ambitious presidential press secretary, clark kent, mason dixon (fia agent who hasn't worked since the bay of pigs), a useless president (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack new york), an even inept congress, a sleazy marketing ceo, and mason's team consisting of an obese east german "female" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed wwii paratrooper and an african-american disguise expert (disguised as george washington, abraham lincoln, hitler and finally as a tomato). did i also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? there are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.on top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. they aren't that good and seem to be dubbed. the best tune is by far the theme of the movie ("attack of the killer tomatoes"). it is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. be warned.most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres. i don't believe i was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. i definitely recommend this movie for fans of b and c grade movies, but only as a rental.-celluloid rehab

there aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough `coming out' movies. every one is a welcome addition to the genre. although the production values are high(the movie `looks' good, matthias freihof (philipp) looks real good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. it is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(east berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. in a way we're seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here(it often reminded me of `last exit to brooklyn :the book not the film).but it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman. it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didn't hack at random. yes, it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, life behind the `curtain' was hard for gay people. a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses.

the fight scenes play like slow-motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic (worst pun by far: "guess what? this time i heard you coming"). the stars are a mismatched pair: brandon lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that dolph lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). note to the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double. (*1/2)

extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. the action is at best average, a bit of nudity chucked in and yes tia carrera does use a body double! the set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case, the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical, lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. the action sequences are by the numbers and lee(who would go on to make the excellent the crow) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance. but given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies (think cobra etc.) then avoid.poor 3/10

well, i couldn't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values. it's a b-movie action-flick, by the director of "commando", that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b-movie with enough entertainment value in it.it's an '90's flick but foremost the movie should remind of an '80's action movie, when these type of b-movies were at an all time high. these movies always went over-the-top and never paid much attention to its story or acting. it was all about blowing stuff up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn't liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies. hard to say why really, since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era.it's probably because the movie is being often far too silly. all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it. the fighting, dolph lundgren running around shirtless, the characters, the story. it all just isn't very good because it's often just too lame for words. the story at times isn't even trying to make a bit sense and what's even the main plot-line of the overall movie? its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences, gun fights and such. and those sequences aren't even much good to watch really. the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really, from the man who brought us "commando".it's foremost a dolph lundgren, in which he gets to play the big action hero star, who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl, played by tia carrere. this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really. both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together.none of the characters work out really. the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one. they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest, or to inform anyone about their discoveries. not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of l.a. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling. and also just think about it for a moment, what is brandon lee's overall purpose in the movie? the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well.too silly, lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough.4/10

seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. i watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren, and all of the other thrown-in oriental actors, and i found the movie so awful that it was funny. then brandon lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie ever.lungren beats out his previous efforts in "the punisher" and others, as well as all of van damme's movies, seagal's movies, and stallone's non-rocky movies, for this distinct honor. this movie has the absolute worst acting (check out tia carrere's face when she is in any scene with dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (dolph in full japanese attire). picture "tango and cash" with worse acting, meets "commando," meets "friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and lungren's performance is very jason voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.the good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). brandon lee is just there being lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.an awful, awful movie. fear it and avoid it. if you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever. this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity.a bad bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. dolph friggin' lundren with a japanese accent is funny enough, but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and, up till watching "showdown," had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.i don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. there are constant references to male genitalia, and not by females, either. brandon lee and dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact before going on a suicide spree, brandon says to dolphy, "in case we don't make it, i want to tell you, you have the biggest d--- i've ever seen."now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? in an action film no less? and would you want those to be your _dying words_??later, there's this gem:dolph (regarding the villain): "i would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy." brandon: "man, you've got a fixation." as the guy at ruthlessreviews.com pointed out, "unfortunately, dolph doesn't respond with, 'i've got a fixation? i've got a fixation?! you're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates! i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose, man."this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain. it's about on par. great fun for the whole family!

*** warning - this review contains "plot spoilers," though nothing could "spoil" this movie any more than it already is. it really is that bad. ***before i begin, i'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so-incredibly-bad-that-you-fall-over-laughing movies. if you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh, this is the movie for you. now without further ado, my review:this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal-mart. that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is. secondly, it stars the lame action-star dolph lundgren. that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is. i'm still shocked that it was even put on dvd (who would waste their money doing such a thing?), though as you might imagine, there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the dvd. in fact, there's not even a menu; the movie just starts playing.first, the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed. it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one-liners; remarkably unbelievable, fake dialogue; and inappropriate comments (like lee's comment on lundgren's. err. manhood, which i'll mention later). there isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie. the dialogue and plot go hand-in-hand, as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion. the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning, and then for again no reason at all, lee's character pulls over to the side of the road, runs around to the other side of the car, and says `i'm not going to let you go alone, 'cause despite myself, i like you! and i don't want to see you get killed!' . or something to that extent, anyhow. there are disgusting one-liners, mostly said by lee. for instance, when duking it out with a bad guy, lee says `you have the right to remain silent . you have the right to be dead!' lastly, i'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about lundgren's nether-regions. when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and carrere, and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear, lee says to him: `incase we die, i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick i've ever seen on a guy.' . yes, he actually says that. it makes no sense and isn't even possible (lee never actually sees lundgren naked, so how would he know?), but the writer threw it in the script anyway. the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game, and lee even admits it. after lee and the underwear-only lundgren defeat all of those bad guys, lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful: `wow, this is sort of like a video game; we just defeated the first wave!'second, the plot of this movie is despicable. it suffers, in my opinion, mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist. the trailer for this movie - which imdb has available for viewing, by the way - makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese yakuza from taking over lost angeles. this is extremely misleading, however, since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all. they make very brief, vague references to the yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers, but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorly-written attempt for kenner (lundgren's character) to revenge the death of his parents, whom the yakuza leader (named yoshida) killed when he was only 9 years old. the entire plot can basically be summed up like this: yoshida wants kenner dead, kenner wants yoshida dead, and the two try two kill each other. and of course all the while kenner's sarcastic sidekick (named johnny and played by brandon lee) acts like an ignorant idiot, and tia carrere gets naked. twice.the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie. the dialogue is so unrealistic, and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more. you'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway, but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.finally we get to the heart of the movie's baseness: the flagrantly bad action. there are so many astoundingly bad, unrealistic action sequences in this movie, it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in. although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well, most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren. for instance, lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one-handed, without spilling his tea. then, when surprised by an oncoming speeding car, lundgren casually leaps over it. or how about when he reaches through a closed door, grabs the villain on the other side, pulls him back through the door, and beats him up? or when he picks up tia carrere, gently walks (not runs) backward through a glass door that shatters around him, and leaps down a one-story height with tia still in arm, only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets? all of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well, with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy instantaneously, while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them. that is, of course, until the final fight scene of the movie. lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart, would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds. despite this, lundgren remains in top-notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with yoshida, the evil super villain. and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real, fully sharpened katanas, which the two use to sword fight. now in addition to his bullet wound, lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms. does this stop him? no, of course not! in fact, a few seconds later after easily killing the evil yoshida (who gets pinned to a dartboard-like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason), lundgren casually walks off with tia and lee as if he wasn't injured at all. god, it's terrible.all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary, gratuitous nude scene every five minutes, including topless women at a party, the beheading of a topless woman, women at a strip club, nude women at a japanese spa, and the pointless hot tub and love scene with tia. not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar, at which rich japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women. which, by the way, prompts lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and lundgren will `go eat fish off those naked chicks!' which, of course, is followed by a disturbing high five. and we can't forget the terrible editing either, like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard, and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy. the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers, which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all.in the end, this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness. it is illogical and impossible, and as a result, remarkably entertaining. if you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema, this movie will make you want to die. if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making, this movie will delight you. as an actual movie, i'll merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10. as an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes, however, this beauty takes the cake.

i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable, i can see why it hasn't been rebroadcast anytime recently. more specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as:1) it is terribly miscast. the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. ali mcgraw (45 at the time) was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26. jan-michael vincent (39 at the time) was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22. the other henry children, and pamela tudsbury, were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.2) some of the acting was absolutely awful. ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable. i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays. 3) the directing was poor. to be fair to ali mcgraw, the bad acting and character development were probably the directing. the portrayal of hitler was way overdone. his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel. some of the other characters are done so stereotypically (berel jastrow) they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them.4) this mini is very dated. the hokey music, the pretentious narration (it sounded like a junior high school history film narration), and the entire prime-time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times. also, too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all, because it will come off more as a late 70's / early 80's "take myself too seriously" prime-time soap drama, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic.remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning, memorable, and critically acclaimed production. i don't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public, it wouldn't fly.

the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli defence force come across a terrorist base . this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script , it grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of david bannon as he rents a room from abby and russell quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who`s not who he says he is . however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that i`ve seen

you believe in god or you don't. you believe in jesus or you don't. you believe he is the son of god or you don't. the choice is up to you.director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary, who opened heaven again for us. encouraging the big bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. the film depicts a theologian bringing some "modern findings" to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play, who happily incorporates them in his play.the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy. more often than not the director's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible.the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus' life and the passion play actor's life. this is an admirable attempt, but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus.my opinion is not important, god's opinion is, but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus' throne.

well, jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie. the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. but, although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (i am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. why is this movie so incredibly boring? i don't know. it just is and so it is not recommendable.

this film really disappointed me. the acting is atrocious. unbelievable. and it's about actors. the story is incredibly obvious: a group of independent actors stage a passion play and, in turn, they start to live out the lives of the characters they play. i've been watching a lot of movies lately, thanks to netflix, and this is the first one i haven't watched all the way through in a long time. i felt i didn't need to see the end; we all know the end of this story.for some, it seems, this "modernization" of the gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening. i cannot speak to any of this as i wasn't raised in the christian church. that being said, i was raised in the us and i live in an increasingly christian culture. i'm curious enough about jesus and about the modernization of the religion, for better or worse. i haven't seen mel gibson's version, but i'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this, except for the most conservative. i just wish this was a better film.lots of these reviews praise arcand's direction and especially the cinematography. i liked neither. the film itself is rather prudish and preachy. i didn't believe the characters' personae and i was never involved with their on screen lives. the play within the play is very much dated and would not, i think, carry it's own weight in a real time production. but that's beside the point. what i really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about. and the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal.there were two examples of this that come easily to mind. firstly, there is a reenactment of the parable of jesus driving the money lenders from the temple: the lead actor, who has fallen for the woman who will play magdalene and who is also a model and dancer, becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial (with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience) with her pants off. he trashes the place and chases them all out. i guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach. the romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high-school rendering of death of a salesman, i.e., not well. please stop hitting me over the head with this high-handed "significance." the other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who, eventually, turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays-corrupt church. why. why does she sleep with this guy. "it brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain." ah, the saintly whore and the lovable old coot. it seems to be just enough for arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters. they are going through the motions and i'm reaching for the eject button.feel free to write me off as bored, jaded or just not interested. feel free to watch this movie and see the passion, in all its beauty, sadness and inspiration, delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade. feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel. but don't say i didn't warn you.

this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham. redgrave's character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with thurman's 20 something for the love of fox's character (why is beyond me). the title of the movie should have been "shallow people on the lake". the actors played like they were in a rehearsal. a dreadfully predictable ending to boot. i can't believe this is on this website as a comedy!

this service comedy, for which peter marshall (joanne dru's brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares) and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin' is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted, everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- there's one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; they're about five feet apart, noonan is throwing them in between, and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar, there are a few moments of brightness: marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying, and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pair.it isn't enough to save this turkey, alas.

the rookie suffers from so much. there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie, the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush. noonan and leavitt just don't know when to quit. it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid, stereotyped japanese guys. but, it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. then it just abruptly ends. even a naked julie newmar in a towel can't save this one.there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long. the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing. stick to martin & lewis. at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face.

it's hard to tell if noonan and marshall are trying to ape abbott & costello, martin & lewis, curley & larry, or some other comedy team, but whoever it was they were trying to imitate, they failed miserably. there's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. noonan (who helped write the alleged "script") and marshall have no chemistry whatsoever; marshall seems to be trying for a dean martin type of devil-may-care coolness, but he doesn't come even remotely close. god knows what noonan thought he was doing, but being funny sure wasn't it. he seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is, but not for the audience. i remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. it was on the bottom of a double bill with a three-year-old jeff chandler western ("pillars of the sky," which was pretty good) and a three stooges short ("sappy bullfighters", which wasn't), and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the three stooges shorts. i stayed around for the end of it (not that i wanted to, but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended), and by the time this mess was over, i was the only one in the theater. i saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night, and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as i remembered. it was worse. the only thing it had going for it was julie newmar, who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her, this thing has absolutely nothing to recommend it. the two of them also play japanese soldiers, and the way they do it makes jerry lewis' infamous playing of japanese characters as thick-lensed, buck-toothed, gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. marshall went on to host "hollywood squares," and noonan kept trying his hand at making movies, but most of them were almost as bad as this. not quite, though, as i don't think anything could be quite as bad as this. a truly pathetic waste of film. don't waste your time on it.

in sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! the director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. to boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. additionally, the film is not really realistic. liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals. i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either ismael or primarily nora. to the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. the actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.

too many secondary plot lines without a primary one. too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason, they managed to stuff this boring film, that does not say anything, with every drama element that is out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep real love" you would think that it would make for an interesting movie, but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there. boring. not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. pity.oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are quite good. that's what kept me from turning it off. to bad their talents went to waste, the film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. it's just the meaning that's missing.

"kings and queen" is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. the other story involves a young man named ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, "kings and queen" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. but, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. for instance, nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. nora is admittedly no mother theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? i don't think so.perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom. but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and co-writer/director arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. this is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.

"rois et reine" is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights. it focuses by turns on ex-lovers nora (emanuelle devos)and ismael (mathieu amalric) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives. while nora's story is played straight and is sombre in tone, ismael's is played mainly for laughs, although it's not particularly funny. nora's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father louis (maurice garrel), and ismael's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party. ismael and louis are just two of the males who have shaped nora's life, and in turn have been shaped by her, the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son elias. as events past and present are played out for the audience, and the ex-lovers become involved in each other's lives once more, it gradually emerges that nora's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye.cult director arnaud desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here, one which has garnered major plaudits in france. he wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone. had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked, but it's not clear in the end what exactly desplechin's film is actually about. heavy-handed allusions to greek mythology and freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but, at least for this unschooled movie-goer, remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters. at other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne "moon river" as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate.**spoiler alert** i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us. this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in louis' secret diary, but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and louis' respective relationships with nora. this seems a cheat on desplechin's part, as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative. one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare, but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film-making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story. in fact, for all its heavy-handed hints at depth, the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced, as if they function more as ciphers for their creator's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right. much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic. for example, ismael, as we are constantly reminded, is a viola player, but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play, and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated. hence, he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist. amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane ismael, but i found devos cloying and monotone (which may be intentional, however) as the elusive nora. meanwhile jean-paul roussillon as ismael's father, elsa wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and magalie woch as the psychically wounded but defiant sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors. catherine deneuve's in it, too, though her role is little more than a self-referential cameo.ultimately, "rois et reine" is very much an acquired taste. should it fail to push your buttons, it's very likely that desplechin's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching.

i'm sure this was one of those "woah!" attractions in 1982 when epcot opened, but now it's just silly. the film's message is cliché. the circle-vision is disorienting. and that awful song at the end is grating. and i really wish they'd install seats. after so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. and when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! you get entertained while sitting down, right? wrong! you're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull, lackluster film. not fun. skip it. in fact, skip canada altogether unless you're eating there. move directly to the united kingdom.

anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal, the author of the novel and screenplay, to air her prejudices, grievances and general antipathy towards the english. the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul.the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight, violent, foul-mouthed, promiscuous, engaging in child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor food, and dim-witted -- tellingly, only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be "redeemed" at the end of the film.by contrast, the indian family are beautiful, clever, educated, can speak many languages, are caring and loving parents, and grammar-school fodder. the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all. had it been the other way round, an english family in an indian community depicted this way, the film would have been seen as racist.there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead, i thought it would lodge in my hairline. first, the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration -- undertext: the english are dirty and promiscuous -- and the men -- undertext: english women are prostitutes. second, the meal with anita where neema's family lie to her about cutlery -- undertext: the english are so stupid, you can make them do anything.but the underlying contempt towards anything english -- even english weddings are an object of scorn -- is evident all the way through the film. the character of anita was drawn so appallingly -- almost the fallen woman trope -- that i finished the film feeling angry.this is not a "bend it like beckham" where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community, and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together. instead, anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste, and this is underscored by a thinly-veiled series of attacks upon the film's "other" community: the english.i felt anita and me is a hate-filled, grievance-based piece of work. on that basis, the bbc should not have funded its production.

i had high expectations following "my beautiful laundrette", "bend it like beckham" and (less so) "east is east". the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series (goodness gracious me, etc). this one falls flat. inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a "those were the days" soundtrack, and lots of "issues" in an attempt to be worthy.i found myself cringing at many points during this film. the writing is predictable. every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. in fact, i have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren't. the characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy indian parents; the working class neighbour; the 'wise' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. the script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. and why it had to be set in the 70's (apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack) is a mystery. possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. i don't know.even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. instead, the usual "bbc comedy" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. "bend it like beckham" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.in summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. give it a miss.

'anita and me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic britain, rather like 'bend it like beckham', or more closely, 'east is east', with which it shares a 1970s setting. the tone is resolutely chirpy (in spite of the dour black country accents), but the film lacks 'east is east's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite. moreover, the portrayal of the film's central relationship, between an asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it. i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer, this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story. 'east is east' was fun and sharp; 'anita and me' seems obvious and dull in comparison.

paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. and all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable "twist") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another "twist." it's all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)

i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants. what i didn't remember was how awful it was!!!i recently caught this movie on television late at night. i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again! suzanne somers (at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three's company') plays a vacationer at lakewood manor. constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest. or should i say, a *man-eating ants' nest*!! one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.if you thought that was pretty far-fetched, you should see myrna loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter! i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!the final scenes depict suzanne, robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered in ants.that's basically the movie. there's really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" draw to the film. it was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time. now, it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station.if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best, then watch an episode of three's company. if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie.0/10

this is another one of those 'humans vs insects/eco-horror' features; a theme that was popular in the late 70's. only you can't really call it horror. there's zero suspense and no gruesome events. in other words: this movie is pretty lame. it's not that it's really bad or something; it's just very boring. a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants. later on we learn that, probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past, their bite became poisonous. some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on. robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours. then they flee in the house, waiting to get rescued. and, man, you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them. i won't spoil too much, but at one point they even use a big helicopter. all the time when i was watching this, i sat there thinking "come on, people, you all got shoes on. just run out of the building. i'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you." it's all pretty ridiculous.of course, lots of close-ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie. ants in the garden. ants in the garbage. ants in the kitchen. ants on the roof. ants in the bedroom. ants in the sink. and the best part: ants crawling on people's faces while the actors are breathing through straws. but when you see groups of ants in wider shots, they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall.one small surprise came near the end. no, it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot. it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chief-fireman. ehrr... what more can i say? this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the box-art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor. there you have it. now, since this is a made-for-tv movie from the 70's, i'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating. now, the savage bees, another 'humans vs insects' tv-movie from 1976 was much better than this one. i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants. lacking suspense, action, thrills, shocks and creepiness, the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch.

a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script. ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed. there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying.spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible. he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. it has to be a mysterious virus. after the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony. this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel.end spoilers overall, this movie is extremely lame. i don't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none. my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film. this is a movie to avoid.

i remember watching this movie when i was young, but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself "that is the title?" this movie is a kind of combination disaster film/insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it. it is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such. the plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. the most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course summers attack scene too. what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through. in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants.

is there a book titled "how to make a movie with every 'man vs. nature' cliché imaginable"? if not, ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. the set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much better. it's amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie.and can someone please tell me what in god's name myrna loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie? a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies.

even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s, ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective(though entertaining for reasons it was not intending). it is sooooo preposterous. apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal. watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way. so many scenes just look ludicrous: a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked, suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed, robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper, bernie casey faking a gam leg, and the list goes on and on. the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls. the cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. i hope she found a good use for the money, for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense. although it is quite a bad film, it is watchable - once for me, and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start-studded actors embarrassing themselves, that made-for-tv feel, and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man. this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected. really quite dreadful.

not only was he invariably annoying to listen to, but he had no jokes. i swear, some fobby asian guy telling yo momma jokes would've been funnier than leary's crap. (well, maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least i'll be able to laugh at least once!) leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes"... apparently he was still high on something; he was just some crackhead imprecating rants mostly drug related. one of his jokes was something like, 'i wouldn't use crack, especially having the same name as between my ass' - oh man, how did he come up with that one?! i swear the only guy that needs to shut the f**k up is denis leary. thank god i didn't have to see him live. this guy totally sucks.if you're easily amused by swearing, and "jokes" where you can come up with yourself, then waste your time with this junk.

this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top korean movie, i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie trailer...by the way, this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8, even though has no clue what it is about.

actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. the actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. there aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.the interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. and the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).ah yes, the virus. i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick i know of, but i can't. a computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? gimme a break. warp drives a la "star trek" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? this is so silly the desired "fright factor" just isn't realizable. the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it. one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues. he needed the money. no other comparison between the two should be construed,however.

i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names make refer to some other names etc. it might be. i cannot realize such things (i don't want to do anyway) because i am not interested in, i am interested in 'cinema'. as for the movie itself, again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. i could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. the movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. as for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. it was just shocking, i could not pull myself together for a while, because i had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. it is like if you don't believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. if you agree with me about this, i highly recommend you cloverfield that is extremely realistic. the design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. dramatically powerful critique. some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie. yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. i don't want to compare the host with other monster movies, but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. by the way, may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema. yes, i like asian cinema too, but this is the fact.

monster - he was great; i loved the special-effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of "the creature from the black lagoon." the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw-dropping.social commentary: much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (under orders from the government) state that sars-like disease is out there. in a nutshell, we get the familiar government cover-up story. you know, i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt, but it looks like the koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. in here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this "monster." it just drags the film down. the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family, presumed dead, was hauled off by the creature.moral: a typical "don't pollute the water" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster. this used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those schlocky sci-fi films. now its "environmental issues" that are the focus.the humor this was mostly stupid. i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny. i don't know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film was purposely trying to be ultra-corny with a take on the old "godzilla" movies. let's hope it's the latter.transfer - the video transfer was good. this was a sharp-looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear-speaker crowd noise. i watched this in korean with the english subtitles. that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.overall - this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern-day monster film. two hours was way too long for this story. how this film drew record crowds in korea i don't know. they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support.

gwoemul (the host) - due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal.firstly, i love monster movies: mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening komodo dragons, the whole lot. creature features are my favourite kind of horror film. so, i really wanted to like the host, but it wasn't to be. there were three major problems with it:the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb pagegenre: action / comedy / drama / fantasy / horror / sci-fi / thrillertoo many damned genres. it took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. anti-pollution, anti-american or anti-government). the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles.secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america, apparently, do nothing. and that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. this lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved).and lastly, the film is clumsily political. it paints the americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment. with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the han river. the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. as well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that.on the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising. some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. there are also some nice shots in the film. some of which remind me, strangely, of the way firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).there is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. it's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.overall, i was really disappointed by this film. i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead i get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated. just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years (the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. for once i'm in favour of a remake. tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. as it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.

what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster movie ever." let's start with the good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. from the get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. the opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. the pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. with in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. in this the movie delivers.after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. the monster it's self looks great: alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it's path. when the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. plot-lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. as for the comedy, let me say this: i'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. however, as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years (still here) i'd like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white-guy. that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, weren't. *********** spoiler************* for example: after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. a new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. this competition is, at it's core, funny: two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy. this subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** end spoiler **************then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment to that nature. instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. so i ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. not in this movie. instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.again, i'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' maybe its in korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page, but never finishes one. maybe it's ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.

i really, really didn't expect this type of a film outside of america. how anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a "thriller" is just sick. auteuil (whom i had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.what's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film "happiness" came out the year before this film. menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. it's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. they were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch "happiness" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? hmm...i wonder. if they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button-pushing crap. 1/10

despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright; much better than i expected it to be. i was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. but in the end, i thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).the cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. i couldn't help thinking, though, that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look-a-like. maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.while it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard, 'fatal error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.

like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. in the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, i imagine... the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and i would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes. oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and i was reluctant to get up and take a break.

i watched this movie. to the end. and that was really not easy. it is so boring, bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from "blair witch project" that you can't believe the makers take this serious. even harder to believe, is how this "product" made it onto vhs and dvd.so, if want to see a horror-movie, just watch "scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability, watch dark area.

please! do not waste any money on this movie. it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids. i couldn't finish watching it, and usually i like watching all kinds of b-movies. how on earth could they find a distributor for it?!!! funny however: check out wikipedia for "dark area". the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. maybe he got loads of money from the producers. money that should have been spend on actors, camera and editing. even that wouldn't have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. unfortunately "dark area" has already gotten too much attention. please, director, producer and author of this movie, stop making movies like that...you are not doing yourself a favor. the world would be a better place without this film.

a friend of mine bought this (very cheaply) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. i thought i'd never watch it 'cause i knew it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic, but then my friends and i got really bored and watched it. from start till finish! i know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece. it's hard to describe. you should see it, it's a real lesson on what people are capable of when they believe they're creative and smart and really aren't. the "acting" is sous-terrain (you can actually see the "leading lady" laugh on some occasions, she's definitely the worst). the "story" is to stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucked. please, pay special attention to "the sheriff". the guy is an adult and therefor has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this. he's extremely bad as well. whatever it did have some hilarious moments. check it out, haha

i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption.although it's been years since i read the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous. very important elements, which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad.if the plot sounds interesting to you: go and get the novel. its much, much, much better.still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich.

not too keen on this really. the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing. i enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. after that it was pretty appalling. tim doesn't fit the role, he comes across as a smug self inflated ass & pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player. it's a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it. there's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates, he's completely self indulgent. i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe i'm watching the wrong film. if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle.

the american humane association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer "no animals were harmed..." (the registered trademark of the aha), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james (1939). needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. i suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but i can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken!

this had a great cast with big-name stars like tyrone power, henry fonda, randolph scott, nancy kelly, henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. it also had technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939.now the bad news.......regrettably, i can't say much positive for the story. it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light....and hollywood has done that ever since. why these criminals are always shown to be the "good guys" is beyond me. this film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. well, that's the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad.hey hollywood: here's a news flash - the james boys were criminals! really - look it up!

in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe. his girlfriend beth (dorie barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. she's institutionalized. a year later she's out, has a new boyfriend named hank (joseph lawrence) and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big, beautiful condo in florida. naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again.lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how not to do a low-budget horror movie. for starters, large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting stupid etc etc. also there is no nudity in here at all. i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped. none of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are only a little bloody and there is no gore. there's one real gruesome one--but that's not till the end.with a few exceptions the acting sucks. dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz. chad allen pops up as brad and he's terrible. lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all. and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence? his character disappears without a trace at the end! dull, stupid, no gore, no nudity--skip this one.

i know slashers are always supposed to be bad,but come on,what the hell is this?it's like a bunch of 10-year-olds saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of their week.anyway,six young people all go to the same house to get killed off screen.we have the brainy one,the slut,the other slut,the black guy,the killer,stereotypes like that.after one gets eaten by a shaking boat,the others all get stalked by some guy who wears a mask the people at the poor box rejected.there's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle,but then it's back to even more boredom,and especially more false scares.seriously,we actually know it can't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves to take his sweet time for everything.after every character you expected to die dies,the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon-to-be-boyfriend eventually get captured by the killer(they get like,pushed down and then faint)and the killer reveals himself.i think the writers of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters.the motive is just lame and don't even get me started on the damn secret.the killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything(and then about ten minutes extra in which he slices up his own arm for some reason)and eventually gets overpowered by a guy with a gun.hey,no fair!really one of the most awful movies i've ever seen.i could enjoy myself more by watching a lindsay lohan-movie,i swear.i mean sure,most 80's slashers sucked as well but at least they threw in some t&a.this movie just has nothing going for it.

this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen... unfortunately, i am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it's not made for t.v. when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language... where was the gore? was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore? i could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue. there wasn't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie. sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.

do you guys wanna know a secret?. this movie sucks. well actually i don't know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies, then perhaps you may find this movie astounding (this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer). the first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers relishing their vacation in florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are. the only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. the second half hour of the movie gains a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no- where-near unprecedented killings. the third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further delude myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show. as far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. a bunch of teenagers go to florida on vacation. while they are busy partying, they slowly (and i mean slowly) begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret. the only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school. one thing that did however amaze me about this movie, was how much betty (im not sure about her name..the blonde character) looks like reese witherspoon. another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times. does that make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she "boo'ed" me when i was just about to go through the guest room door..whats the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece???? do you wanna know a secret??? i'm not sure about you guys, but i don't..

ok, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid slasher movie.we got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going. we got a fbi agent that's seen dirty harry one time too many. "so what's the secret....punks?" we got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all. "hey man, i'm fixing the sprinklers" ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies, he gets killed.they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere, with no cops. suddenly she's in a church, wearing a wedding dress. i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen.

**spoilers** redicules slasher film that makes no sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black robe and wearing what looks like a pull-over peter lorre rubber mask. were told early in the movie, almost the very first scene, that young beth morgan was in rehab due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in tennyson collage about a year ago.it's also brought out that fbi agent sacker's (jeff conaway), who's obsessed in catching the killer,daughter was also murdered in tennyson around the same time. by the time the movie "do you wanna know a secret" is over it's never explained just what those two killings back in connecticute has to do with the slaughter in florida of some half dozen collage students a year later? other that the killer, at least in the murder of beth's boyfriend, wore the same silly halloween outfit. at spring break in the sunshine state the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time. starting with computer geek brad clyton, chad allen, the killing even spill over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief gavin, jack mcgee, getting sliced open. the masked killer saves beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church, in what looks like the florida everglades. he then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does, none. trying to scare it's audience all the movie does is confuse and bewilder it with a number of not-too convincing slasher scenes. the most effective ones having the victim oz washington, tom jay jones, survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up, together with agent sacker, the hero in the film. oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large splinter of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously recovered, after getting arrested for a murder he didn't commit, in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk! it also made no sense at all why oz and beth went on their own to tack down and catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cellphone that oz had, instead? beth's boyfriend, who loses his head over her, in the movie hank ford, joseph lawrence, is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house.they together with with beth oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight! for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of hallucination on oz's or the local police part. until the off-the-wall final scene where they popped up in the church.we also get an insight on a previous relationship between tina and hank with her, drunk and acting obnoxious, trying to get it on with hank as beth walks in without hank and tina even noticing her. that seemed to have upset beth even more then her boyfriend being murdered at the beginning of the movie!

this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions. for all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work. a f- in my opinion. i have one question, what were they thinking? let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad acting 5) bad directing and last but not least a bad script. i mean i am not like grumping about every movie, but i was disappointed when i watched it. this movie should be banned into a box, locked and sunk down into the sea. so please don't do something like this again, please, please, please!!!!

i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. judge for yourself. be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.a computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. when the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. this virus is very intelligent. when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage, which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm. fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.oh dear...

in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe. his girlfriend beth (dorie barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. she's institutionalized. a year later she's out, has a new boyfriend named hank (joseph lawrence) and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big, beautiful condo in florida. naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again.lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how not to do a low-budget horror movie. for starters, large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting stupid etc etc. also there is no nudity in here at all. i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped. none of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are only a little bloody and there is no gore. there's one real gruesome one--but that's not till the end.with a few exceptions the acting sucks. dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz. chad allen pops up as brad and he's terrible. lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all. and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence? his character disappears without a trace at the end! dull, stupid, no gore, no nudity--skip this one.rated r for graphic violence and some profanity.

good deaths. good mask. cool axe. good looking girls....but watch out!!! no plot and little scares completely lower it's standards. they tried to make an "i know what you did last summer", but ended up making a "scream". but hey, what do people expect from a horror movie? answers totally vary. rent it if you want, but i regret ever seeing it.

the secret is...this movie blows. sorry, but it just did. ****spoiler****in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream, beth, played admirably by dorie barton, joins several friends on a spring break trip. the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. then, the deaths begin. first one then another then another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results. one note, dorie barton is the poor man's reese witherspoonshe looks like reese, acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police lineup. maybe that's how they cast her? anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing.

i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. needless to say i was brutally disappointed. set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. first, there are gaping plot holes. second, very few of the c-list (i don't even dare call them b) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. to the films credit, it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.so, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction.

a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red. _undertow_ is pointless and unengaging, and made me think often of a phrase by twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together. when someone brings up the category of worst films ever made, it's not the likes of _plan 9_ or _attack of the killer shrews_ that i think of; it's the likes of this. what a complete waste of time--my own and everyone who was involved with this flick.

robert wagner is the evil boss of digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system' 'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time''but it's not going after software, it's killing people'watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard

just below the surface lies what? a simply awful movie is what.as other viewers have justifiably commented, the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous. chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain? now that's smart. menace? foreboding? sexual tension? for those read dull & contrived, dull & contrived and dull & overly contrived.i want to say thank god for mia sara's shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film, having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all. so it just becomes yet another contrivance. do yourself a favour and give this a miss.

the viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one, or why, for that matter, anyone bothered to make it. there is no plot - just random scenes of ridiculous action. mia sara's shower scene appeals to the male libido, but that's not much reason to make a movie.

i sat through this turkey because i hadn't seen it before, and because the premise sounded like it had potential. it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. at the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving! in fact, when the characters move outside the house, bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. at that point, whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one, it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state.

as a premise, this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise.however, director eric red's inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors.ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting.charles dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. but ultimately, undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.

oh dear, what a horrid movie.the production was so cheap and nasty... remember the shot from "the natural", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that roy hobbs makes a bat from?? well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house.i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural, or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up ?then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck. such over-acting in the cabin. a really bad film, a really bad film.

this has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. will be used in the 9th circle of hell at recreation time. just plain torture.i would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. horrible. horrible. horrible.you know, the good thing about swiss cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's only holes - and the excitement factor? well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an olympic speed sport.my brain hurts from trying to work out who ok'd this drivel, did they think about the premise? (i sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. made for tv should not be a synonym for: "sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! our audience are idiots!"i was hooked just to know how it could get any worse. this is not a good sign, folks. hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.i should be ashamed for watching it.i am ashamed. i'm off for a long shower.

i didn't expect much from this tv movie. you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr. still, it managed to disappoint, failing even to be a good-bad film.every scene was by rote, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, leaned back and said, "my work is done". it's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).do yourself a favor. watch "the x-files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. they handle it better. also, let anyone know that sitting through "fatal error" is just that.

final score: 1.8 (out of 10)after seeing 'jay and silent bob strike back' i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie. 'soul survivors' is a junk "psychological thriller" dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like dushku, wes bentley (american beauty), casey affleck (drowning mona) and likable star melissa sagemiller. luke wilson is also in there, ridiculously miscast as a priest. the movie, the brainchild of writer/director stephen carpenter, seems like a mutant offspring of 'open your eyes' or 'vanilla sky' and movies where a character (and the audience) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident/death. the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved. i don't think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with, but 'ss' is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it. the visuals, the script, the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this. plus, it's pg-13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or t&a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure (even the unrated version is tame). i had heard that the movie contained some "hot" shower scene between dushku & sagemiller. as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least i would get something out of this. then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts, they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. that's it. people thought this was hot? 'soul survivors' is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it. it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. in the end it leaves us empty. carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part. it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci-fi channel, due to it's low cost and pg-13 rating - and that's probably best for it.

this su*k! why do they have to make movies that they must know su*k from the beginning? i mean, look at alien from 1977. if the movie you´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before, why make it? i had problems with the plot and who the main character was. that's not good either.

i saw this movie a long time ago... luckily it was for free. i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. i don't remember a whole bunch of it, but i do remember i was incredibly bored, the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was. i just was incredibly bothered by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive, why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? how stupid do they think we are?

the world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart: yes, it's solar crisis, aka crisis 2050, which burned up a huge chunk of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video (remember them?) in a re-edited version credited to one alan smithee. the plot hook's pretty much the same as sunshine - suicide mission to the sun, saboteur on board, logic cast adrift - except that this time they're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach earth. with a talking bomb. voiced by paul williams. who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously given that the cast also includes jack palance at his most dementedly ott, charlton heston at his most rigid, top-liner tim matheson at his most anonymous, the original hills have eyes' unforgettable michael berryman (you may not remember the name, but you do remember that face) and peter boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because, er, if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down, you'd expect if not a laugh-a-minute at least a laugh every reel. no joy. this is the worst kind of bad movie: a boring one. the fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace. there's low-key and there's walking through it, but here the cast don't even do that. instead, they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time. you keep on hoping for paul williams' talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis, but instead the film just... stands there, doing next to nothing. literally. this is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if clive owen had been cast, he'd almost have looked lively by comparison. even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves, yep, the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness. even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world. merchant-ivory films have better action scenes.things aren't much livelier down on earth where the movie spends most of it's running time with matheson's son/chuck's grandson corin nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with palance's insane desert artist "looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me" while waylaid by rejects from a mad max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can release him on a nice beach. just don't expect logic, if you haven't already guessed that much. best moment? a ditzy girl in a bar describing jack palance as "an old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather," though chucky baby taking out the villain's aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99% of it's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin'. richard c. sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes: the director of vanishing point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re-edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film. a film so bad it's not good, and painfully unfunny with it

yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can.boring direction and performances (with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the ever earnest charlton heston) earn the rating of a real stinker.it's amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is. he even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie. the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn't. it simply falls off the end.really. don't waste your time on this one.

extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel.what was even worse was marlon brando's performance. his southern drawl was ridiculous. i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. tyrone power, in "witness for the prosecution," should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here.the film, dealing with racism, dealt with the u.s. government's attempt to avoid marriages between u.s. soldiers and japanese women.brando was stone-faced throughout the movie. his moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman. his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances. nothing about either performance was equally impressive. umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka, who did nicely as brando's love interest. she showed great emotion as the anti-american who found love with the brando character. her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11. she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in "the ten commandments" to the bigoted mother of brando's love interest at first. her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted. patricia owens, as brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.

i had high hopes for this film, since it has charlton heston and jack palance. but those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so. palance was ridiculous. not even heston's acting or annabel schofield's beauty (or brief nude scenes) could save this film. some of the space effects were quite good, but others were cheesy. the plot was ludicrous. even sci-fi fans should skip this one. grade f

i was expecting a little something from "k-911", i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into. i always did love the dog comedy movies. but it looked like it was supposed to be jame's movie, not jerry lee's. the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. james just really ticked me off for more than half the film. the dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.so, i'm glad it's not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. but hopefully, james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. don't you wish ashlee simpson would take that same advice? :d 3/10

if you are one of the people who finds "according to jim" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. and might i add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc, which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year."k-911" is a big, steaming, brown, german shepherd-sized "thank you" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve. jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard. look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.if you enjoy jim's work, this movie is your reward.

the original was a good movie. i bought it on tape and have watched it several times. and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb. the romance was flat, the sight gags old, the spoken humor just wasn't. this may not have been the worst movie i've ever seen but it comes close.

i am very disappointed with "k-911." the original "good" quality of "k-9" doesn't exist any more. this is more like a sitcom! some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back. the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show. that was crazy. what's the deal with the change of police? it seems like they are now lapd! not san diego pd. it is a completely different movie from "

the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands. but she is speaking german to him. the 2 languishes are completely different, its like saying "well he takes french commands" and start talking spanish.james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest. the role just doesn't fit him, even if its mend to be a comedy.to many stereotype/predicable stuff. typical comment or comebacks.if you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv. but i wouldn't suggesting renting it.

this movie was just plain bad. just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. bad guy gets away? check. partner? check. wacky personality clash with partner? check. rookie with something to prove? check. rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they're saving those old chestnuts for dooley's next outing. add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. avoid this one at all costs.

i just got the uk 4-disc special edition of superman 1 for about $5. the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole-men. so i slapped it into the dvd player last night, and here are my findings.some initial disappointment - i hadn't checked, and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials. i'm not a huge fan of george reeves as superman, and i hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn - but hey ho, never mind.this black and white production runs for less than an hour. it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves' early tv series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series. in any event, it's an odd choice for reasons i'll get to later. i'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. even so, for a low budget movie, this one is really low budget.the story concerns the small town of silsby - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). the story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.a deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. the little guys scare some kids, so jeff corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these "creatures". superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised mole-man. superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. a total of 4 mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey (i call this an aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go "aargh!") and superman saves him. he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the mole-men go back down the shaft. the end.despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - i have left out all the "mole-man 1 creeps from a to b, looking out to make sure no-one is following him" stuff. the mole-men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. they do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.reeves is quite a good clark kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than phyllis coates' rather indifferent lois lane. but he is a terrible, terrible superman. not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. i'm sure he was told to "strike the pose" (which superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.and superman does a huge amount of walking around (i say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. he takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. in fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.i've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards i think it's a pretty threadbare effort. thankfully, production standards on the tv series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.something of a disappointment - i shan't be watching it again.

back in the 1970s, wpix ran "the adventures of superman" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years. every once in a while, we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air "superman and the mole men." i always looked forward to those days. watching it recently, i was surprised at just how bad it really was.it wasn't bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. true, george reeves' superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible. and true, the mole men's costumes were even worse. what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year-old, since the zippers, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. but these were forgivable shortcomings.no, what made it bad were the contrived plot devices. time and again, superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating. a lynch mob is searching for the creatures? rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man. the creatures are cornered? again, he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot. luke benson, the town's rabble-rouser, shoots at him? attempted murder to any reasonable person, but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems. superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud, but never once took advantage of them.that said, both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles. if only they had been given a better script to work with.

"you're not going to shoot those little creatures. in the first place, they haven't done you any harm. in the second place, they may be radioactive." ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi yet despite the odd gem like that, superman and the mole-men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. it's beyond cheap (the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute mole-men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and george reeves' man of steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by jeff corey from killing them. an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.

this film is notable for three reasons.first, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking george reeves' and phyllis coates' initial appearances as clark kent / superman and lois lane. part of the opening is re-used in the series. outside the town of silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow earth' allowing the 'mole-men' to come to the surface. forget about the other holes (those in the plot).second, unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. no 'mild mannered reporter' here! clark kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout ("i'll handle this!"), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole-man! as superman, he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as "nazi storm troopers." third, you will notice that the transition from the fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'adventures of superman' had not yet been made.

"the domino principle" is, without question, one of the worst thrillers ever made. hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream "i give up!!!"how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks.i hope they spent their money well.

okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say. to start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic. simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void. example; who the heck is trying to 'shut down' santa clause? is it some sort of corporation? a little explanation would of been lovely. second: the movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care. third: i suppose this was suppose to be a family film? its rating was low at just pg. for a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. it didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem. through the whole movie paul giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies. mouthy frat boy. (nothing against vaughn, he's been good in other movies)so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick. in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental.

how hard is it to write a watchable film with vince vaughn, paul giamatti and kevin spacey? apparently very difficult for the writers here.i still have no idea how santa is younger and looks 20 years older than vince (who plays the big brother). i must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of "funny notion" scenes that are drug out way too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.the director/producer tried to go "tear jerker" at the end, which would have been suitable if anything leading up that point had been worth following.ugh, major disappointment. i can see how some people might enjoy this ok, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but i would strongly encourage waiting for dvd on this one. not worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.

every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life. i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa. so sue me. i admit it. i like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. i like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of santa in all his guises, from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton? fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls, but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed. "fred" is a perfectly ok holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids. my wife and i laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince. paul giamatti was a top-notch santa, which helped a lot. not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual christmas traditions. but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice. there's nothing wrong with that.

painfully bad christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by vince vaughn, who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his r rated films. vaughn seems like he's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance. after 30 minutes into the film, you would be in touch your inner scourge and say "bahumbag" at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes, you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point. out of all the actors involved in this mess, only paul giamatti and rachel weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film. paul giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of saint nick himself but he's forced to vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. you can see in giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film. rachel weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film. fortunately for her, she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face, unlike giamatti, who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie. the direction also feels uninspiring, like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.i don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved (giamatti and weisz) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with, spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a christmas movie of all things) and a actor who just does not care about his performance (vaughn), you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch.

i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it's a mess. i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80's classic " santa claus the movie" but with out the camp or the bad sheena easton song at the end. .the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting. of course fred (vince vaughn) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend (rachel weisz in a cameo role) dumping him, so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus (paul giamatti) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of christmas. now if you think you know the ending of this film, i think you would be right because it's predicable to the hill. as for the acting, vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable, miranda richardson plays mrs. claus but the role is more than less one note, elizabeth banks plays santa's assistant but she's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film "glengarry glen ross" but a little more anal. the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and rachel weisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs, which is a shame because both rachel weisz and paul giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.to put it in a nutshell, a major disappointment.

alien hunter: 5 out of 10: is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell, new mexico suck. take alien mixed with the thing, mixed with contact, mixed with of all things on the beach, the andromeda strain, the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot. derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join him. he turns her down. aggh!) in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. i mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke.with about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif. (note that since jason of friday the 13th fame, pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) the characters in the cornfield dress like logan's run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear. john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie.

i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing, final fantasy, the abyss etc. framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario. i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless. moreover there is nothing to watch - the fx'es look like there were taken from a second hand store, you generally saw all of them in other movies. but it is definitely a good lullaby.

what did producer/director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy's novel and kennedy's very puzzling screenplay? were there a few pieces left out on purpose? and what about gene hackman, richard widmark, edward albert, eli wallach and mickey rooney? what did they see in this very muddled story?and why did candice bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role?the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin. a major misfire by stanley kramer.

this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. there were a couple of sub-plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end... but they didn't. if you want a "alien in the frozen waste" story, stick with the 1950's version of the thing (not the abomination that was remade in gore-o-vision 20+ years later).i couldn't get over the fact that the "alien" looked pretty much recycled from independence day. the "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood.lots of scenery chewing with little payoff.

snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station, as you toss this into the waste disposal unit. spend a useful 90 min. living your favourite game. disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk. it takes a bits from several other "science fiction" movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story. there's nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film. any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally i would like my 90 min of life back.

is it a remake og the thing (1982/1951), i think it is, there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it.so the acting is bad, james spader does a superlow stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other actors i did't even notise. you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. and the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. score/music is ultraboring, imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early 90's. if you like slimy aliens, chills and thrills, don't whatch this movie. its a dull combination of the thing, alien 3, outbreak and some jerry bruckheimer/michael bay production gone really really bad. now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing, and the only ones on this production that knew that was, no one.though i have seen far worse, i would not recomend this movie to anyone, but if you are up one cold night, and just wanna glanse at something, it will pass the time, slowly.

begins better than it ends. funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors. it's like those scenes where documentary shots...--- spoiler part ---- the message dechifered was contrary to the whole story. it just does not mesh.

an unoriginal, overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci-fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something, and in of all places (surprise, surprise) antarctica!the film features james spader and an almost nameless supporting cast (with the exception of carl lewis, who's actually not that bad for a non-actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances that do little to invigorate the script's unimaginative dialogue. to make things worse the film's pace is slow, there's almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting. its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd. what is a wonder is why spader - an excellent actor at times, who won the cannes best actor award for `sex, lies and videotape', and did a splendid job in the innovative sci-fi flick `stargate' - chose to sign onto this lackluster project. or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.the most remarkable thing about `alien hunter' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci-fi films, and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived. there are huge borrowed bits from `the thing' (both howard hawks' original and john carpenter's excellent 1982 remake), `contact' and `outbreak'; a few hints of `alien', ce3k', `the andromeda strain', `kubrick's `2001' (i.e. the `alien black box') and `mission to mars' (i.e. the mystery message); and even a little dash of `sneakers' and `a remarkable mind' (although not sci-fi films, they share a `cryptology' connection). hell, there's even cornfields and antarctica, just like the recent `x files movie'. and the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from `the abyss'.its all been done before and done a whole lot better, although i will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end. i could say a little bit more about the plot, but there's absolutely no need. you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it. (5 out of 10)

very bad acting, and a very shallow story. not even a decent b-movieevents that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.this is one of the worst sci-fi i've ever seen. i saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, but it sucked so bad.now there's really very few good movies on alien subject, i think because most of them are low budgeti give it 3/10

with one of my very favorite actors, james spader, i expected this film to be at least tolerable. it wasn't. after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. so trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. one can even predict the dialogue word for word. this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, "how did this movie ever get made?" in an effort to say something positive, i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. but, on the whole, if you've seen 5 sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

recap: something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica. the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica. julian rome, a former seti-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. soon the object is in the open. the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. it is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, julian decodes the signal. "do not open". but too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. the first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. and washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. so a russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica.comments: the movie holds a few surprises. one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. it is never really explained why washington know so much, why washington is able to command russian submarines, why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now. it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english. some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose english, why?). but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus, send their "do not open" message encoded! and finally the end is as open as an end can be.the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.3/10

"hey everybody! i've got an idea, we found this egg-shaped thingie from outer space so why don't we thaw it out and open it up?" "yes, i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race, but hey, i want to know what's in it". "and nobody tell nasa, they might take it away from us". "wow this thingie gives off vibes!" "yes,really strong ones on contact so don't touch it but it's okay to cut it open". "hi there handsome, check out my nips". (later that day); "do not open"!!!!! uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here. "i've never seen such organic technology!" "yeah, lemme take this stick and stab it.". "i'm getting out of here, i don't care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth, nobody's nukkin' me!" "look! it's the friendly aliens from "the abyss"! they want us to come with them". the end

the acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. brad pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious austrian climber quite well. other acting is fine. the story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but i could not, try as i might, involve myself in this story. as an unabashed brad pitt fan (i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), i expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.it could be a failing within myself, but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. it's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. it wasn't. probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as i was. mostly, it bored me.

stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. richard widmark, edward albert, and eli wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view, the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. kramer's direction is devoid of any style. it's a very sunny movie!the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey. even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick. one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife. we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell.

ok, here it is: "nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama." what we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between french, german, american, and british for over 2 hours. then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. but just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of lhasa in 1943, speak perfect english, also with dubious accents. of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the dalai lama befriend the now-reformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west. in return, our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague, undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion. we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. in other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go. and last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans (which is certainly true), thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a "political" movie, even though it is nothing of the sort. so, zat ist my idea. vat do you zink? can ve make zis movie?

i read the book "7 years in tibet" from heinrich harrer and was fascinated of it. then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie. i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. well, now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on. and soon i realized how wrong it all was told:when they enter lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and thewlis and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in tibet, so they greet back... in the book harrer explains, that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in tibet and they may do it in front of the dalai lama but certainly not for these two europeans! not only the mother but even the dalai lama himself was wearing glasses in the public. in the book harrer mentions, that no one in tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason, but its explained in the book too).the young dalai lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about that mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young "living buddha"?? childish... and the tailor made harrer and aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not european designer suits! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the female tailor...)that is completely unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book. but that was ok for me because "7 years in tibet" is not a book about harrers person. its about tibet. i'm very disappointed by this "adaption" of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.

i've read all the comments on this film. i am a great admirerof the dalai lama. as such, i read the book upon which thisfilm was based. the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. i do not criticize it foraltering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it isnot a documentary. but the script changes the impact, reaction,realities, and changes in every main character. it vastly altersthe real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama. from the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman (which demeansthe culture of tibet) to harra's music box gift, to harrar'schange of heart, everything about this movie is false - exceptfor the amazing photography. i understand that the shots of thepotala (the palace) were smuggled out of tibet. however,changing a real story about the relationship between two people,one of them very important to this world, in order to build up amovie star is sad

i can't believe it, imdb really does have every tv show known to man! i have not seen this show in over 20 years. i only remember two episodes, and i barely remember those. i remember that tony may not been on from the start, because one of the episodes i remember is the one in which everybody trying to get tony to join, but he rejects them, but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of power house, with everybody cheering.the other one i remember is the one where lolo for some reason pretends to be dead,(complete with funeral and mourners). i don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends.this is one of those shows that i convinced myself that i must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it.

this doesn't quite plumb the depths of creepshow 3, but it comes close. it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracting to say the least.it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone (with the bookshop being comparable to serling's later night gallery). unfortunately, the producers & writers forgot that serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over. none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.framing story: adam west is... well, himself. he doesn't go the bruce wayne/batman campy 60s route, but he rarely does. he simply plays the not-particularly-enigmatic "jay" (there's an ominous spine-chilling name to compare to the likes of dr. terror, eramus, and the cryptkeeper), and makes some mildly awkward/creepy statements.abernathy: seen rod serling's "a stop in willoughby"? then you've seen this. the red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp. as well directed as can be expected, but basically incoherent.nex's diner: reminiscent of various serling time travel stories, mixed with steve allen's "a meeting of minds." most of the actors aren't too bad (except for josh astin as cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is mildly interesting. but like abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere. the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out a bit (who wouldn't?), and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.life replay: not a bad little piece, and manages to predate both click and creepshow 3. i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. the main character is mildly sympathetic. nothing substantially innovative here, but it's okay.fighting spirit: you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character, it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption.finale: so... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits? don't know. and doesn't make sense. so... all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped? kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), and the guy in the first segment died. so how did he get trapped? did he visit the bookstore before he died, got trapped and... didn't die? what? huh? i supposer this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural. but still...overall: basically not dissimilar from the two newer twilight zone series, or some episodes of tales from the darkside or monsters. the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. but there's nothing really spectacular here.

i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job. the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film, it certainly was not. besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. the one about the remote control didn't even make any sense. to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch.i'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. i only watched it because of some good comments posted here. they must have been planted by people with ties to the film. you may fool people into watching this, but you can't fool them into liking what they saw.i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming. sure it failed miserably, but it tried. i reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst.do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. i wish i had.

and maybe, as fred sandford used to say, "one across the lips". that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public. and perhaps to the person in "rue morgue" who called this a "fender hellbender" and said it was good.five young girls, apparently taking a short-cut home from a high school football game, become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere. while there the driver accidentally hits a parked suv & knocks out a headlight, but the girls all decide to just leave & not go find the driver. but the driver does come to find them, and it's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged, it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand. when the driver does first catch them she (yes, it's a she) brandishes a shot gun & makes them strip down, and keeps screaming at them, "how much did you see?". of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about.as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the suv, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them. eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage. and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialog, and huge lapses of credibility. one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded, and she's feeling cold, her life is passing before her eyes, but she got better? and how far can a mini-van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour? i need one of those things, it apparently gets great mileage.there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge, but the film goes on for a bit after that, which is an anti-climax, but they at least learn some of what set the woman off, and the driver is still worried about "messing up her mom's van", which is obviously the least of anyone's worries.so this isn't the worst film i've seen, but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible. but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this. which, by the way, i don't necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.

five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it. soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off. shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas...produced & directed by greg swinson & ryan theissen with swinson writing the thing & theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst, i mean i'm struggling to think of a film i have seen that's worse. now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb (the amount of 1 star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?) & it's message board which i think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film i have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & i have to agree with them. the story is terrible, alright i suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? there's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random. it goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot. oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passion.on a technical level again i can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again & say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen. as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & i definitely don't want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk. it really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & i hated every moment of every second of it. just think the blair witch project (1999) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there. there are times during five across the eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels. the violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.low budget doesn't even begin to describe five across the eyes, with a supposed budget of about $4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. the two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. the acting is pretty bad by the main cast, i just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely.five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen & i have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention. i hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it.

i never finished this movie for a reason, it was dreadful and thats just the acting. i wasn't even sure what the film was about tbh it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful. i mean ususally i like some nude in a film (lol) but it was just sick because of what was happening. all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities. this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it. (n)

im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.

there are really two sections of this film. firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'the simpsons' troy mcclure should be doing the narration.then the rest of the film begins (starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film) which, while technically ok, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense.this is especially so with mickey rooney's spiventa, who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? in that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is.the overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy. it's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.put simply, the film fails on all levels.

less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful. all this "horror" movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it.the movies plot had potential to be something great, but it just doesn't happen. a group of five "teenage" girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them. two minutes into the movie, and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop. all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too, so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them.the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. none of these women looked a day under 20, and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old. at least get people who look the age. none of them gave even remotely decent performances, and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities. the "actress" who played the killer overdone it, but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't - a little bit of talent.the characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. that is all i can really say about them, and it did not help that they all survived. if i have to go into detail, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot. one girl injures herself and is whining about it...four of them aren't wearing seat-belts...what do you expect? one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer...and you all just happen to be conveniently "too hurt" to help? whatever.the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible. i don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out, shook and brushed up against an "actress" was horrendous. it was also grainy, and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying (not that it was anything worth listening to).supposedly the killers car in the movie (that supposedly got hit, even though we only heard the accident) is actually the directors car in real life. no wonder they didn't show the car getting hit! this movie is so cheap, they can't even show a car getting a little scratched up. oh, gotta mention the soundtrack also...if that's what it was. it was horrid...sad one second, then hard rock the next. at the end of the day, five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home-movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. it doesn't help when the script is terrible, the scares/tension/suspense and (hardly even any gore to make up for it) are absent, the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous.this was a horrible low-budget movie. avoid it at all costs.1/10

this "film" attempts to follow the genre of low budget, hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful.this one, fails, and how.it's amazing how many so called "awards" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this....words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is. seriously, it's that bad.i watched it in 20 minutes flat, on almost continual fast forward.from rubbish lighting to dreadful directing, grainy visuals to muffled sound, and of course not forgetting the abysmal acting, this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making.it seriously, has no redeeming qualities - whatsoever. save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick, there are plenty out there - dead end, the blair witch, rec, to name but a few.avoid this rubbish at all costs. do not waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.take heed of all the other comments! you've been warned!

um... okay, i guess i get the whole shaky-cam, gorilla-style filming technique but unfortunately i think a gorilla could have made a better movie... this thing was just a complete mess from the get go. bad acting, bad directing, bad story and horrific cinematography. how this piece of garbage was released i will never know, but it has and unfortunately i watched it. filmed on location in tennessee by the directing team of greg swinson and ryan thiessen (harry and lloyd), "five across the eyes" i'm assuming is supposed to resemble a "blair witch" type film but falls short... okay it nose dives off a cliff. i was actually embarrassed for these young women, whom i'm sure were promised hollywood stardom, but ended up in this dung heap. the dialog is ridiculous, and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. how this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scary about it, except for the fact that i watched it... try this one on for size: there is 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass... "the end". saddly it went on (and on) for 95 more minutes of mind-numbing stupidity...i saw it for free, and wanted my money back.

first, it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. what a waste of time, we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. again, another 20 minutes. then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. all of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. by the time the real action gets going, i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end. hackman is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.

gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination. it's a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job.nobody tells him anything though, he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information. that's supposed to be suspenseful, instead it's annoying and boring. hackman goes through with the mission, but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up. so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care.one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit. maybe something really was lost in the translation, but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience.a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark, candice bergen, mickey rooney, eli wallach, and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime. and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this, the fbi, the cia, the dea or even the irs.

i can't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie. that's all i've got to say - the movie speaks for itself!!

i love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick.i can only wonder, what were they thinking agreeing to this crap???debra winger just phoned it in; dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures. some people thought it was deep. well, if you liked "breaking the waves", you'll probably like this too. i hated both. 3/10

blazing saddles! it's a fight between two estranged brothers (dennis quaid and arliss howard), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest debra winger caught in the middle. director glenn gordon caron (the tv whiz-kid behind "moonlighting") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in vince gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. these aren't even characters, they're plot functions. barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good. winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed. *1/2 from ****

let's see. in the "st. elsewhere" finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child. "newhart" ended by telling us that it had all been a dream. and "roseanne" ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind. very "creative". annoying was more like it. yes, it was just a tv show and wasn't at all reality. it's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all "real". at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen. this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. now "newhart" being all a dream? at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever. roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.

yeh, i know -- you're quivering with excitement. well, *the secret lives of dentists* will not upset your expectations: it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative, truthful but dull. it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice (already a recipe for trouble: if it wasn't for our separate work-lives, we'd all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation). campbell scott, whose mustache and demeanor don't recall everyman so much as ned flanders from *the simpsons*, is the mild-mannered, uber-dad husband, and hope davis is the bored-stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera. one night, as dad & the daughters attend one of davis' performances, he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing: he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera. (one nice touch: we never see the opera-director's face.) dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation, divorce, and custody hearings -- profitable only to the lawyers -- scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife's indiscretions.already, the literate among you are starting to yawn: ho-hum, another story about the pathetic, sniveling little cuckold. but rudolph, who took the story from a jane smiley novella, hopes that the wellworn-ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy, postmodern touches. for instance, one of scott's belligerent patients (denis leary, kept relatively -- and blessedly -- in check) will later become a sort of construction of the dentist's imagination, emerging as a devil-on-the-shoulder advocate for the old-fashioned masculine virtues ("dump the b---h!", etc.). when not egged-on by his imaginary new buddy, scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three-way with two of the male dental-assistants who work in their practice. it's not going too far to say that this movie is *eyes wide shut* for real people (or grown-ups, at least). along those lines, campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman. further, the script for *secret lives* is clearly more relevant than kubrick's. as proof, i offer the depiction of the dentists' children, particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old, and whose main utterance is "dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad!!!" this is family life, all right, with all its charms.the movie would make an interesting double-bill with *kramer vs. kramer*, as well. one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from 1979 to 2003. in this movie, dad is the housewife as in *kramer*, but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role, unlike dustin hoffman, who was too manly to make toast. here, scott gets all the plumb chores, such as wiping up the children's vomit, cooking, cleaning, taking the kids to whatever inane after-school activity is on the docket. and all without complaint. (and without directorial commentary. it's just taken for granted.)the film has virtues, mostly having to do with verisimilitude. however, it's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions, which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five-day stomach flu makes the rounds in the household. we must endure pointless fantasy sequences, initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary. whose existence, by the way, is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in *fight club*. and this finally drives home the film's other big flaw: lack of originality. in this review, i realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films. granted, this film is an improvement on most of them, but still. *the secret lives of dentists* is worth seeing, but don't get too excited about it. (not that you were all that excited, anyway. i guess.)

there may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer. suffer they do, in this dreary, truly dreadful film, but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non-dental variety too. if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, barfing kids, sick kids, lots of long, long meaningful glances, a deadpan wife and a concerned husband: it's all here for you. boring, overlong, it stands out as one of those examples that scream out: why? is there a saving grace? yes, there is. there is a short scene from nabucco, with some pretty good singing. save your money, or if it's on tv or cable, save your time. you can always read a book or make an omelette.

this is an in-name-only sequel to "a christmas story," originally entitled "a summer story." ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small hick-town in the middle of nowhere. hilarity, unfortunately, does not ensue.the original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it. this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all. charles grodin's last movie - no wonder! it's one of his poorest roles. i felt sorry for him.mary steenburgen is given little to do, everything's formulaic, and you have to wonder why they even bothered.and i mean, come on - a competition with spinning tops?! sadly, it's the best part of the movie...

really bad. why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery. i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved "a christmas story." the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level. charles grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters. for another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just doesn't flow well. everything seems tired and forced. the joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end. i wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed "a christmas story." it's that bad. 1/10.

funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float. sure they used various actors for batman, but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape. in this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for christmas... somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original... if i had not known it was a sequel i wouldn't have guessed it from the cast... except of course charles grodin tries so hard to imitate darrin mcgavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better...in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better. they should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel. this one is just a cheap imitation. the ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die.

since its release in 1983, "a christmas story", the jean shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego, ralphie, has become a true classic. "my summer story", however, still has shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely none of the charm, and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film."my summer story" is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories, which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops. charles grodin, who i normally like, is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father (more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original), and his character never seems anything but forced. kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie, and the little brother is all but forgotten here. only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on "free dish night".the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin. may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to "a christmas story", it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of 10.

"a christmas story" is one of many people's all-time most beloved films. acs was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have. it had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare.so i awaited (and awaited) its sequel, "it runs in the family" . the film was almost released a couple of times, only to be pulled at the last minute. when it finally came out, iritf was (and is, i guess) a total failure.the sets and cinematography were just fine, but the directing totally, completely missed the mark. the film was nothing more than a cash-flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing, and disconnected acting.the narrator, jean shepard, who was one of america's great humorists and story-tellers, forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in acs. he over-emoted, and why he did that i'll never know. he somehow managed to become an annoying, overwrought parody of himself.the writing and acting in iritf is inauthentic and forced. the actors may have seen acs, but whatever wit and nuance that was in acs mustn't have registered at all on any of them. the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of shepard's dry humor.acs will always be a real treasure, but to call iritf a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and acs.

i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick. "well lets see now, we spend 50% getting dirk benidict, cause battle star galactic and the a-team were cool. the we spend 40% making a demon costume, never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script. and we spend the rest making the movie." this was pretty bad and very cliche.... have a loved one present when watching (or bring a good book)

this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative. it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection.the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational. i would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me.but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me. perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over.i think the voice over is too glib.

'sherrybaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. this is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. even maggie gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid.

this piece of crap, since i can't call it a movie, can be summed up by the following.-stereotypical black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble -black midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face, body hair and genitalia -black midget is mistaken(somehow) by man and woman who happen to want a baby -black midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence, demean white people wherever he sees them, and commit more crimes -happy endinghonestly, it could have been a good satire if it hadn't been directed so shallowly and had such talentless bastards star in it.

when watching little man , you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes . and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy ! your supposed to be laughing at it !! but will you ? probably not. the main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoonish comedy ), so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is."but its a comedy " some of you might be screaming. thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot.i mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face , wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious? and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag? and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man ? i mean seriously...what ? "its not about the plot , its about the laughs" you might be screaming . well heres the thing see, there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more. if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot, stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs.what ever you do steer clear of little man.

since this picture is classified a "pure entertainment" work and since there are already many comments on it, i'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. we can see that marlon wayans is playing the joker role in this film. certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. however far away from what i expected, i saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. and with a ridiculous happy ending. so what is the point? many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? in addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's no.1 cullinan! but the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. and they call it humour. a diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.

so, has it really come to this? are we, as consenting adults, to blame for the next generation of cinema-goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability? concerning the wayans and co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario; little man. this united kingdom p.g. (parental guidance), anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult, certificated movie, is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were "wiped out" from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's.the predominantly under twelve's audience here who, some without grown up supervision too, sat there, obediently, taking it all in, oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that little man portrays, in part at least too. movies, in general, can do better than this poor attempt, while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh, the biggest fear for the future of cinema is that a child's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss. cinema deserves more than this, and so do its ever growing, and in the literal sense too, audiences, this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever-impressionable minds of the young.there is no cinema experience here, no open eyed wonder, no awe-inspiring respect to the magic of movies'. there is nothing but bewilderment and contempt, for the lack of substance, originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the hollywood machine, for the sake of a quick buck, we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie.will this have the likes of hitchcock, fassbinder, leone, kubrick and schaffner reeling in their graves? money they all liked, no doubt, but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality, and to a vast degree, respect for their profession and audience, they were never short off. we are seeing, once again, with the works of the wayans clan another cliché of bad taste, while the likes of white chicks (2004) were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of american society. the irony here is that the two leading protagonists, played yet again, by the wayans brothers, are so much undercover, that all recognition is non-existent, this makes for a better movie too, and it is the actor terry crews that gives white chicks its substance and personality, not the wayans.yet again, with their pastiche of 1970's blaxploitation movies, as with the 1988 movie i'm gonna git you sucka, this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie, with heavy weights as isaac hayes, jim brown, bernie casey and the gorgeous actress ja'net du bois. the point being, that little man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever, he is shallow and narcissistic, with no appreciation or value toward his followers, he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it, has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism. there is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent, after scary movie (2000), things could only have gone up, but alas they did not, no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls' next movies shall be straight to video, one can only hope.the wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves, to a certain extent; they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody, they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style. they have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that cinema have given us, may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement, as their growing audiences, so far, seem to be, for when the bubble bursts, may they be as understanding too.

i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. the so-called "jokes" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. i never want to have to see this **** film again, i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face

i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse (supposibly children's) film i have ever seen in my life.i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins. the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film. they should pay you to watch it not you pay them. it's truly truly awful, there is no other way to describe it. the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences.aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards, stephen

i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12a here in the uk. to my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (which is not a problem to me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin etc... and for the most part of the film not very funny.the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a 2inch midget, gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag. so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby, getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.up until now, i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.a bit of good advice - wait till it comes on tv or cable

what's the point of reviewing a movie like this? it's painfully and embarrassingly bad, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it.movies like "little man" depress me. they represent film at its most disposable. this movie was made for a bunch of 18-24 year old dipsh*t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was, so that the film could quickly recoup its investment.a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit.grade: f

america. a land of freedom, of hope and of dreams. this is the nation that, since its independence, has striven to bring democracy, prosperity, and peace to the entire world, for the good of all mankind. there are times, however, when one cannot help but wish that the american's would just stay on their side of the atlantic. this 'movie' (and i use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with an intense purity. this vision of hell follows the adventures of calvin, a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of marlon wayan onto the body of a two foot-high dwarf. after inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of vanessa, a career-woman who is reluctant to have children, calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her. so, as any normal man would, calvin dresses himself up as a 2 year-old and parks himself upon the poor woman's doorstep, where he is discovered by darryl, the broody husband of vanessa. darryl incongruously falls for calvin's disguise despite the fact that the 'baby' has a full set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife-scar, and the sex-drive of a 16-year-old. even more absurdly, vanessa doesn't see past calvin's baby-wear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert. this wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts, and fails, to find humour in rape, scatology, sexual assault, and paedophilia, however, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of 'family-entertainment' the wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality. the brothers dim attempt a freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he "had a bad father". repeatedly hitting darryl in the crotch enables calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that both he and darryl have always wished for. as if this wasn't ridiculous enough, calvin's attempts to sexually assault vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound little-woman, who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband. in this movie the wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichéd sentimentality that has infected much of hollywood's recent body of work. additionally, they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming african-american humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over-indulges in fart-jokes and crude sexual gags. by rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again. unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of american cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals.

"little man", now on dvd, is a wayans brothers flop. it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist. he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home. he then goes through all sorts of "home alone" or "child's play" like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film. the jokes have been done in other places so many times, that they aren't cute or funny. i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who marlon's face was pasted over. in watching the deleted scenes (minus cgi) this actor was funny in a mini-me like way, but they chose a different route. a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes..spend your rental fee $ on borat if you want some real laughs these days.http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com

this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless . . . because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!this film is even worse than white chicks! little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby. story is awful considering it was written by six people. the idea still wouldn't be too bad though, if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode. it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid. the acting was very, very bad. so was the directing. anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. it is racist and very offensive to midgets. i mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, the film-makers make fun of them! it really disgusts me how they do it. they see midgets being just like babies. and for a character who is a midget, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. that is its lame excuse for showing something like that. it just was not worth it. don't watch this film. it is a huge waste of time and money.

this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life! the plot is ridiculous and the whole "little man" crap is just so stupid. the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb. let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters. the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous. please, i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap. i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed. i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of! who writes this crap? the actors have no talent what so ever, how do these people get into hollywood? they are making money off this junk!

like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously, i'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went', "yea!!! this is it. this is the next film we are going to green light!!" and whoever that person is, should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity. because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script, well, i'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money. this film is atrocious in every way.the wayans are funny, at least they can be. they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way. but in here, not only does the premise defy all logic, not only is the acting terrible, not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to see this film. maybe if it was free...naaah, it would still be a waste of time.usually i'd be inclined to write some long winded, detailed review about why this film is so bad, but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking. this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack.0/10..makes my top ten list of worst films of all time!

it's here. finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy: health inspector. yet i'm willing to bet the the wayan's brothers(hilarious) will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time, outside of my fifth grade outside the class re-enactment of romeo and juliet. i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to. the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials. final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me. and the commercials looked so promising...

there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee,carl franklin,billy dukes,denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry . then there are the wayans brothers who at one time(15,years ago) had an extremely funny television show'in living colour' that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others . now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags(toilet humour) as the standard operating procedure . people are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'little man' they couldn't possibly be . a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old ? baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off . it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands,darryl's, back .oh, yea that is just hilarious . as a master criminal 'little man' is the stupidest on planet earth . he stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her . co-star chazz palminteri,why chazz, offers the best line: "i'm surrounded by morons." based, without credit, on a chuck jones cartoon, baby buggy bunny . this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny . a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night,prior to the bat awards and he did not,even mention this dreadful movie . when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers . when they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood .

there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled "baby buggy bunny" that was exactly this plot. baby-faced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into bug's rabbit hole. he dressed up as a baby to get into bugg's hole to retrieve the money. the scene in "little man" where he's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon. this was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much an entire movie. if you are really interested in this, buy the bugs bunny dvd. it's was much more original the first time (1954). plus you'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot!

...ever. this is the bottom. i am not joking. the theater should've had a warning of some kind. 'abandon all hope ye who enter here' would've been fitting.i don't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is. its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse. this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr. fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes.i remember when the wayans's were funny. i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate. i'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in-the-balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon.i disliked nearly everything about this movie. i won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans's face poorly superimposed over the midget's body. what i did like was the ending. not the movie's resolution, but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out.i gave this movie one star, but it clearly deserves less. i don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star. this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it.when are people going to learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out. seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. avoid it at all costs. you have been warned.

when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct.i am a big fan of the wayans brothers. i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks. little man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.obviously, the joke will revolve around marlon wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. he and his partner, tracy morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington. in order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour. all these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok. i mean, it was not 100% believable but it was ok...nothing great. i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.wait for it on cable or television. it really is not worth any amount of money.

i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back. thsi film isn't just poor its dire. it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made.i regret watching this film.flixmedia reckons its a race issue, apparently "white" people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors. mate, i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel.please stop making crap films

"women? they're all scrubbers...!" no, not a good translation; not at all! this lags behind the previous year's "dad's army", entirely missing the special, small-screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original, and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen... you could just about say that this film well represents a britain entering decline, and more precisely even than that, a *british film industry* entering decline. and that is hardly a recommendation, is it? to be an exemplar of saddening folly...all that remains after the subtlety of the tv original has been surgically stripped away, by cliff owen, galton and simpson are: endless, dilapidated musical cues, yawn, from the ron grainer theme... bolstered sentimentality (that shoddy, thick-eared ending... how much bolder does the second steptoe film seem in comparison) an increased seediness - with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely - fully applicable to something like the 'misbegotten monstrosity' (yours truly on this site) from 1973, "the mutations". there is a strangely botched, cut-adrift tone about the scene where harold is beaten up in a rugby club, that i partly hate and recoil it (so far, as a friend intimated, from the mood of the tv series...), but this at least seems an original slant, and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the britain of 1972... there is, however, an implied prostitute, aye of a 'heart-of-gold' who turns loose woman-traitor 'pon poor auld 'arold - and beyond-caricature writing of the 'class' element; not to mention, surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads. brambell and corbett collude with the script, and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham. what would anthony aloysius hancock have made of it all...? i will merely concede that a few moments just about work - chiefly those where g & s play things a little more carefully and b & c touch tenderer nerves - and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair. but, and oh, how this pains me to say it: it is tiresome, boring, both wilfully detached from reality and what made the tv series great, and also fully in tune with the lazy, tawdry, misogynist 'fuck it, that'll do...' actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film-making in the britain of the time.

let me start by saying how much i love the tv series. despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. in my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time. the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.this movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film. this movie has a very dreary, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. seeing harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie. the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.the romance between harold and zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series. in the tv series, harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers.albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series. in the movie, albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.most movie spin-offs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the on the buses films (which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself!). but, steptoe and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below george and mildred.my advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, steptoe and son ride again instead. it has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the tv series, and is actually very funny.

despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is an awful movie. awful enough, that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. the movie is set in the final period of the raj, during the time of india's fight for independence. what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. what the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era. for instance, would the young married hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married englishman master, knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment? unlikely, but still maybe. however, would the same young hindu housemaid, in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spears in heat, partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment? that is not only bloody unlikely, that is a retarded plot line.such idiocies combined with the poor acting, drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie, so i did not watch the second half of the movie. one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half.

i have to admit that i liked the first half of sleepers. it looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. a superior hollywood film. but...no one mentioned this so far (at least in the latest 20 comments), when it came to the courtroom scenes and brat pitt´s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, i felt cheated. this movie insulted my intelligence. warning spoilers!!why did anyone accept their false alibi, witnessed by the priest? if these two guys had been with him, why shouldn´t they tell this during the investigation? amnesia? if you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away?i am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me. this movie had great potential. 4/10

this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it, they might wake up and do something about it. over the last few months, abc family began airing a new format of movies. i have seen the last three and enjoyed them. they were engaging and did the trick. my wife likes these films. i was looking forward to viewing "see jane date". the trailers looked and sounded great. unfortunately, this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project. the year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. it was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. it worked against it. i work in the business of film and television . i enjoy being entertained. this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse. the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie. to add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. an advice to the executives at disney, abc , abc family and the producers: under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films. they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word "contemporary" , "present day" and "current" means when describing a romantic comedy. there is a world passing you by. all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von zerneck-sertner and abc family.

this movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. there are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).*mild spoilers*we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. instead, director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.*end spoilers*avoid this one. for an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the korean film a tale of two sisters (2003).

this series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. there's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. at times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "cub," who nearly gets lost early on. all in all, disappointment.that said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.

"arahan" adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre. to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chow's films is a mistake.firstly the fight scenes are nothing new. all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang, tony jaa and jackie chan. fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic. there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the "matrix" sequels.the attractive female lead so-yi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in "house of flying daggers". having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies. to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see aya ueto in "asumi") unless you are a very talented director which as "arahan" proves seung-wan ryoo is not.

i began watching this movie with my girl-friend. and after 5 minutes i was alone.i succeed to stay until the end. it has been a painful experience.i liked jean hugues anglade, but i think that he needed to eat, as us, and thus he accepted to play in this movie. there are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called 'art' or something that i couldn't express, but that i didn't understand at all.the only worst movie i saw was crash, but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again.good luck!! ;o)

i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat. but this is no swat. swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. bullfighter had none of these. i should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role.one poster here called the movie incoherent. another called it the worst movie ever. both gave the movie far too much credit. i am so glad i got it from the library for free, yet i still feel ripped off.imdb needs to include a "0" in the "rate this film" vote, just for movies like this one.

i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. it was buy 2 get 2 free and i needed one more so i chose this one. horrible mistake. the box reads like it would be a really good movie. well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie. for about 5 minutes, that is. the movie is about a young woman, laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, jack, from a bull. laila's dad, cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of. he assumes that jack killed laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. that was the first 5 minutes that is good. what follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse. whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever. jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride. i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character. you know, jesus' mother. but, who knows, i couldn't make heads or tails of it. as they're running... we get to see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc... and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on. needless to say, i took the movie back and exchanged it for something else. it's horrible i tell ya, horrible. and, there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie. unless you count the first minute of the movie. hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie.

some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential. but it never comes together as anything more than a student's graduate thesis in film school.there are two primary reasons for this. fist, there is not a single likable character, not even a villain we might admire for his/her chutzpah. secondly, all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe. the ham is so plentiful here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up.all right, i'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said, the camera work is quite good.but i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a "modern western", and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making.that betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we don't like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly muddled, and in the last analysis, we just don't care.i took it out of the dvd player about half way through. but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back.now, that really hurts.

i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe, and robert rodriguez. i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it, than it has to be good right? wrong wrong wrong. by far the worst editing since "manos hands of fate". the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore. i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film, maybe they owed somebody, but they are way to good for this. besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn't even talk. so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing, poor acting, and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned.

i didn't know willem dafoe was so hard up for bucks that he'd disgrace himself with such shocking hamming in this monstrosity. hell: i'll donate that money that i was going to send to ethiopia if he's that desperate. i have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long time...who paid for this? they are either pulling some tax scam or insane. a 5-year old would be ashamed of the plot, and i'd rather get cancer than sit through more than the hour i suffered already. everybody involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison. avoid at all costs. i'd give it minus 10 if possible...unbelievable.

"bullfighter" was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason. i wonder why? could it be: the confusing storyline, the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez, and the annoying editing? it's got to be. i think the plot was mary (michelle forbes) and jacque (oliver martinez) go on a mystical road trip. they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too. the movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. most movies, when trying to subtle, don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects.don't be fooled by the cover: willem dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.

no scenario, bad actors (poor melissa gilbert)... beurk beurk beurk ...give a such budget to make this... in belgium, we make ten films which win all prices in cannes with this.last time that i've seen a such null-film was hypercube. but scenario was better.is anyone knows if the director was a graduate in school-film or a cop ?the better things in this film was the word "end".why authorize to sell this ? 1ç is to expensive. i've pay ten dollars to buy this.for me, pay for this was my big mistake of millennium.too bad.next time i'll break my arm but buy this type of sh*t.

i am very tolerant of really bad sci/fi and horror movies - i've been watching them since i was 4 or 5, so i've seen some really bad stuff, but i deal with it. i've even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much - a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of. hope springs eternal, i guess - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. unfortunately, this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it, but like a moth to the flame, i kept thinking something, anything, interesting would happen. it doesn't. all of the actors give a decent performance - given the script, i don't know how they all kept straight faces. it has something to do with collagen-starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. there's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans...don't worry, he gets what's coming to him. the slug people themselves don't really know where they came from, they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth, but...somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self...oh, must i go on? please, i implore you, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this...anything would be better...think of the worst, least enjoyable way you can spend two hours...it would be better than this.

"kids like these" could have been a decent film, given the subject matter. but instead it has become a below-average, run-of-the-mill tv-movie of the week, with not much going for it. the acting is stale, the plot predictable and the direction non-existent. for a better movie on the same subject, try the excellent "le huitième jour", a film that really cares about the people with down-syndrome. in "kids like these" they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality. pretty appalling. 1/10

i watch lots of scary movies (or at least they try to be) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through. i never knew the depths of masacism until i rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive. i am a fan of julian sans, but this is worse than i would hope for him.on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued...for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand. perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me, especially when we had to turn the video off, and that simply is not done with our watching (we had to make one exception obviously). if it were up for a remake, i'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1% of the original incorporated into it. that's all.

this is the movie that i use to judge all other bad movies, and so far there hasn't been anything close.the only good thing i can say is that after watching this i know that i have seen the worst movie i will ever see.

semana santa is jaw-droppingly bad. it's so wrong in so many ways i don't where to begin. so, let's see...mira sorvino, whose judge husband has been shot while protecting her, goes from madrid to seville for her cop job. during the holy week (semana santa, see?...everybody begins to fall sleep..told u it was bad in so many points, even from the beginning), a killer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena. she teams up with male chauvinist pig olivier martinez and nice feodor atkine. soon she discovers she'll be the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). why, oh but why?why..;that's the questionthat has been in my head the whole movie.q :why did go to see that a : because i love mira sorvino (i even excuse her for that at first sight crap)q : why were we only 8 people in the theater this saturday on the first week end of release? a : ah-ah-ah. spider-man got relaesed the same day. but also the fact that the movie has been blast with execrable reviews.q : why this movie has been made? a : money i guess. but boy did mira need the money.then...why???????????? first of all, there's always something wrong with european co-productions. here you got a french-english-german-italian-spanish-danish production. yi-ha.then it wants to play on the same playgroung as us thrillers/slashers/whodunit/mysteries/whatever. even valentine, though unnecessary and badly scripted and shot, was much better in the suspense and the fun.then , to give some credit to the story, the screenwriter wanted to add some political sight to the story. wrong : done in flash-backs in a traffic-like photography, it's certainly the most interesting thing i n the movie. could have stick to it, it wouldn't have to sit through the whole movie. better go straight to guillermo del tros's the devil's backbone (el espinazo del diablo)for some clever fun.then the homophobia. bullseye! the first victims are s&m drug addicted gay twins who got stabbed to death. the annoying olivier martinez goes to a dating agency held by a badly shaved overweight transvestive with a blond platinum wig. calls mira sorvino's character a big dyke all the time. do we need this kind of stuff? nah. just needless offensive remarks, just like ol'times.then the suspense. yipee. no apparent motive. the first murders are plain illusion as they're a representation of a famous painting. but no. and the revelation of the killer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been done from the beginning as he appears at the end of the movie as, i guess, it was time for the director to say "weel, time to finish that damn movie. let's reveal right now who the killer is and why he kills".then the director thinks he's a director. wrong : no sense of suspense, no sense of directing the actors, no knowledge of change of pace. a giant, mega-bore. the scenes of the holy week are needless (maybe a co-production rule saying : ok, shoot in sevilla but show some creditsof this beautiful and historical town with the celebrations of easter. there we are : a mystery movie for tourists!)then the actors. all wrongs. mira sorvino bores herself to death : she does practicly nothing except getting stabbed in the right hand. everything she did best (the replacement killers, mighty aphrodite...) were like they never existed. olivier martinez...hello, anybody here? when the producers will learn that he's not an actor but a mannequin with no ability of speech nor feelings? feodor atkine, bland and transparent. only do we pay great respect to alida valli, one of the greatest actress this last century (and i hope for some more roles in this current one). she's tha main attraction here as she's the only one to give life to her poor lines. i won't mention the other actors as they're only one-sided characters, uninteresting and shallow.incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, implausible plot. idiocy incarnated.superwonderscope says : 1

"semana santa" or "angel of death" is a very weak movie. mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people. mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time. couldn't she just speak english? all the other characters have a forced mexican\english accent which is distracting. the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden. the cinematography looks nice, but that's not enough to save this tripe. this next part of this review does contain spoilers!!!! during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away, but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing. that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever. avoid!

this may actually be the worst movie that i have ever scene. incoherent would be a compliment. even the end made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over. i watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did. by the end of this mess i was sorry any of the characters survived and i wasn't feeling too charitable about the actors either.if you want to watch a train wreck, i recommend hanging out at a train station. even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess. apparently i haven't vented enough to fill up my prescribed ten lines so, at the risk of redundancy, i will say it one more time. this movie is a zero and it would be less if i had a word for an even lower rating. how about minus zero?

i agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it. i was surprised by their performance, expected more since they're good actors.thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse. i even laughed at some bad stunts!! when is supposed to be a mystery movie. you can even guess who is the killer beforehand!!! for real what happened?? sorry to say but don't even bother you'll waste time and money.boring!!!

songwriter robert taylor (as terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and can't see straight over otherworldly norma shearer (as consuelo). "she makes the sun shine, even when it's raining," mr. taylor explains. but, mr. taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near ms. shearer. finally, at the palm beach casino shearer frequents, taylor proclaims "i love you!" shearer brushes him off, as she is engaged to george sanders (as tony). however, to settle a gambling debt, shearer hires taylor to pose as "her cardboard lover", to make mr. sanders jealous.this film's title invites the obvious and appropriate three-word review: "her cardboard movie". it is most notable as the last film appearance for shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from "he who gets slapped" (1924, playing another consuelo) to "the women" (1939). to be fair, this was likely the kind of shearer film mgm believed audiences wanted to see. however, the part is unflattering.plucked and powered, taylor and shearer were better off in "the escape" (1940). if shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than "leading lady"; apparently, she was no longer interested, and certainly didn't need the money. taylor has a great scene, reciting christina rossetti's "when i am dead, my dearest" while threatening to jump from shearer's balcony, as directed by george cukor.**** her cardboard lover (6/42) george cukor ~ norma shearer, robert taylor, george sanders

even by 1942 standards of movie-making the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme. the machinations of one half of a pair (of husband/wife, ex-husband/ex-wife) to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another, divorce, or an eventual separation by means of jealousy, humiliation, or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story. both of these movies features women with a strong, indomitable screen presence and who played independent, proto-feminist characters. in both movies, both women were estranged/divorced from their (witty) first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite, and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon-to-be husbands and re-igniting their passion for each other.the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender: here, it's norma shearer in the cary grant role out, this time, to ward off an ex-boyfriend (george sanders) by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo. the problem is, shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid-to-late twenties; sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most -- any man who would be in love with his fiancée, on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here, would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene. not here. and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time, not in speech inflections but in overall essence.but the worst part of it is shearer herself. for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence, playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over-acting, over-emoting, and over-gesturing which, while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier, makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge. it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of (most of her) roles; why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs. miniver on mega-hits now voyager and mrs. miniver is a mystery, but then again, most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting, that she'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and can't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible. such could be the case here. she seems lost, she seems tired, she seems ill at ease, going through autopilot instead of living the part. after this film she would make no more, but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s.

******spoilers******the unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi, karloff, and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland, sporatically watchable haunted house spoof. lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress' fortune; karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums, but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi. of course, kay kyser and his band of 30-something year old "kids" uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way. not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist.

solid comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. boris karloff, bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy. the script contains all the standard mystery film props-sliding panels, secret passageways, thunder and lightning and poisoned blow-darts. karloff, lugosi and lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era. kay kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940's who were trying to forget about the horror's of world war ii.

i knew my summary would get you. how is this movie like a pet rock and disco?! well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why anyone would like a new coke or own a pet rock (and frankly, at least in the case of pet rocks, i still don't understand it completely). they're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. the same can be said for kay kyser and his band. at the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with boris karloff, bela lugosi and peter lorre in this film. yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of "entertainment". after all, kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). frankly, i couldn't stand their antics nor did i appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.the film involves kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. eventually, it culminates in some attempts on sally's life and a séance (of sorts). it's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast.overall, it's passable entertainment at best. as a lugosi and karloff fan, i sure felt cheated having to watch kyser and his knuckleheads.

one of the silliest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser. kyer, orchestra leader and radio-star (and eternal college fraternity goof-off), was sort of the precursor to spike jones, hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians. he's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall. the shindig is beset with a creepy judge, a scary professor, an ominous swami, lots of giggly females, and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures. the songs (by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer) are nothing to brag out, and neither is over-confident kyser, yukking it up with elbow-in-the-ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years. * from ****

i'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. it's a first and last attempt by writer-director soo lyu. "rub and tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of canada's program to promote home-grown film-making. while the program encourages worthwhile efforts like "new waterford girl" it opens the door for untalented novices like lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. you don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in canadian massage parlors. but the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. when your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. don mckellar's performance as conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in "exotica". lindy booth's lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. kira clavell's cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of asian shelley duval. the only other role of any consequence, tara spencer-nairn's street-wise betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in "new waterford girl". her shallow performance in "rub and tug" should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of "waterford" director alan moyle's skill in working with young actors. you quickly conclude that lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and lame "deus ex machina" device toward the end is hardly a surprise. still it could be worse, the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

if my memory is correct, when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry. if that's what it's supposed to be, it doesn't really work. it just isn't that funny. setting that rather significant (since this is called a comedy!) failure aside, since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter, i'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto massage parlour, except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull. for over an hour, this movie really doesn't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters. conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren't giving "full service" - a euphemism for actual sex. as for the girls themselves, betty's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business, cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is - well, leah is a somewhat strange, undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well, because she's in it! i have no idea what her character was about. those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business.the movie meanders about and doesn't offer much until the "twist" reveals conrad to be the bad guy. we should have gotten to that point sooner. the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story - conrad's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls. that plan for revenge was pretty good, and you're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you're wondering why you wasted your time with this. had the story been more focused on the revenge, this might have actually been a fairly funny movie.the performances from the 4 leads were all ok, although i didn't think anyone came across as outstanding. all four characters were a bit shallow. cindy was a sympathetic character, and so was conrad for a while, although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie. given the subject matter, there's surprisingly little nudity (and what there is is restricted to one scene.) in fact, there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this. as for the overall quality of the movie, it's a low-budget effort, which shows, although you expect a certain griminess, i suppose, of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour, so that's forgivable. it certainly says something, though, that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer-director soo lyu's resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry - that it wasn't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards - the canadian version of the oscars. 4/10 - and i'm being a bit generous with that.

this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing! rachel griffiths must have needed the money. the film must have been made on a very low budget, because the lighting was non existent. i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i'll commit suicide. i'd be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2)a script. my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish.

billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty, about unemployed men in sheffield, this movie is a fake.as someone born in sheffield, and still with links to the city, i was extremely disappointed by this film. someone said it could have been set in oklahoma, and that just about sums it up for me. this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market. probably many americans - and many southern english people - don't realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead-end semi-rural small town, where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the people's idea of a party was line-dancing in some village-hall lookalike. this was a small close-knit community, not a metropolitan city.the working-class sheffield men were totally unlike their real-life counterparts, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks. they don't chatter, and they certainly don't sing in choirs.even the rural settings, supposedly in the peak district, looked alien to me. i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales. indeed, in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd, wales. the peak district is, in the summer, crawling with walkers and tourists in cars. it is situated between two big cities. it is not some kind of wilderness.as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with, and lust after, pete postlethwaite, that was ludicrous, and could only have been a male dream. her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent. none of the men was shown as having a partner or families; they existed in a vacuum.anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray. this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle-class writers and film-makers.it was a gigantic fake!

what a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. there are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is star wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. the prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. utterly disappointing.

this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got george lucas behind it, and it has the words "star" and "wars" in its title. that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. this is a travesty.first things first. the story. anakin's evolution? there is none. apart from a little make-up around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. he becomes young, stupid, cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow. the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith? unacceptable!the fight scenes used too many digital doubles. everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house. count dooku, emperor palpatine, anakin, obi-wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.in one specific fight scene, obi-wan and anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. i realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.the writing was awful. all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just wasn't enough. i can't say enough bad things about this film. too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. this is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. we know the rough picture of everything, all lucas did was colour it in.we knew anakin lost his limbs. we knew luke and leia are brother and sister, we knew luke is anakin's son, we knew obi-wan and yoda go to exile, we knew everything. nothing new is offered in this film. if that's all the fans wanted, then that's fine, lucas couldn't have gone wrong.but when anakin finally becomes darth vader, and he asks after padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams "nooooooooooooooooooooo." that scene screamed b-movie all the way, and i was half expecting darth vader to go "danger will robinson, danger" at any time. that is what this is. a b-movie, disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth.

revenge of the sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. the only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and i mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader. and when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. not great. not even good. but pretty all right. this movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. but you have to say, wow, those cgi environments are really impressive at times. bu the lightsabre fights? they're all a blurry mess. i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. this will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. i saw the 12:01 show, and after it, i heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! but everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: i fell asleep in the middle. it was kind of boring. i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better. so said we all.

first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies...i don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). i am simply a fan of the films.with that being said, i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (ep 1, 2), i don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie r2 suddenly being a badass, and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch), horrible acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? there was no real internal dilemma within anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the "noooooo!" frankenstein scene). when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is not a great movie. for a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of all characters.i close with a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?

ludicrous. angelic 9-year-old annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old annakin, who somehow seems appealing to amidala, 5 years his senior. now 22-year-old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. ludicrosity squared.i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. the story is ridiculous. the characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.).obi-wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character? not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. none of that here. the story could have been written by a 10 year old.oh yeah, the cgi is pretty cool.

i'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck. it finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films. with jedi, menace, clowns and sith we have the death of lucas' career. he wants us to swallow the annakin is vader nonsense? i never believed it was true. this film vindicates those feelings. the story hasn't worked since phantom moron, and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade. i have to go. i know where some new rocks to throw are. you want spoilers? here they come. luke and leia are not related. vader is not their father. duke countoo should have switched sides while he still could. yoda has less verbal skills than yogi berra. his advice has never been any good to anybody. obi wan lied to luke for the first two films. annakin didn't build c3p0. he found him in the desert and lied to his mom about putting him together from scratch. chewbacca has fleas. this whole mess with vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h amma-lamma-ding-dong. if she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of annie, but she had told do what george lucas wrote for her. what a dope!

to make a film straddling the prequels and the "real" star wars trilogy would tax even a great film-maker....mr lucas is not that film-maker.to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor...mr christensen is not that actor.the first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star wars.count dooku (christopher lee) has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar binks silent! no the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi and has one great (overlong) sequence at the lava falls

well, i finally saw it. i didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, i was afraid. afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. while not as bad as menace, and better than clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying.i was 11 years old when i saw star wars. i still remember sitting in the theater. from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience i'll never forget. a timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting.and that's not to chastise lucas for using an old formula. it's an old formula precisely because it works. and to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special.then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. the great villain, vader was luke's father. wow, no one saw that coming. of course, i'm convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. go back and watch star wars again. knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes.which brings me to the problem i have. revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. but a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as i'm forced to realize george lucas is (the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--liam neeson, natalie portman, samuel jackson).*****spoilers ahead******** the plot. oh my. understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. one too much for him to overcome.first we have the sheer absurdities of the background. we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the "chosen one". well, this detail never gets remotely explained. indeed, the closest explanation is yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. oh, well, okay then. our mistake.now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c3po. hey, what a coincidence that is. and he'll come back to tatooine and never know he was from there? wow! how about that. testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh george? anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history--the great tragedy of darth vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end.how, pray tell, does this happen? why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the "dark one to be" to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality.well, of course he does.sheesh.how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? how can anyone expect us to care? hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid.oh, by the way, amidala finally dies. in childbirth. why? well, they don't know. the doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of "she's lost the will to live". well, oh, okay, of course she has. maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.but here we are. we have kenobi present for all this. he knows of the birth of luke and leia. knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. knows, also, the role of both r2 and c3po. and yet, in several years, as luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3po and r2 (curiously, 3po's mind is wiped, but not r2's--why????) stating "i think these droids belong to you", kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be "the chosen one" and apprentice to the emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says "strange, i don't recall owning any droids".oh good grief.lucas simply made this up as he went along. once he introduced vader as luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because he didn't know what the story was. the plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all. and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars.it's an afterthought, and it looks it.i can't give this movie a high rating. it reminds me of triple x. a fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. star wars will stand in my mind forever. thankfully, this one, and the two preceding it, will soon fade.

at one point, violet (lucy liu) tells neil (cillian murphy) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure. she said "because i'm bore-phobic". it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities. well, i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic. because "watching the detectives" is a cheer boredom. have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once? neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop. he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward. but neil's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store. she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal, whereas neil is completely opposite to hers. the question is. is they are going to be in love at the end? you bet."watching the detectives" is a cliché romantic-comedy to its core. and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else. from the first couple of set-up, we know that neil is pretty laid-back guy who didn't really commit to anything. and then, violet enters the scene, looking all weird and annoying. so at this point, we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end. is it worth waiting for? i would say no.as i said, they tried to give something more for the audience. "watching the detectives" is trying to talk about commitment. to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire. we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart (or whatever). well, i think it is completely bullshit. this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself "forget about it, that girl is one of a nutjob !" after collaborating with many great directors recently (danny boyle's "sunshine" and "28 days later", ken loach's "the wind that shakes the barley" and neil jordan's "breakfast on pluto" to name a few), it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop, paul soter. by all means, he's not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this. on the other hand, lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet. her acting is a mess. i mean it's all over the place and so over-the-top. tony montana would have been proud.the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title. you simply can't really connect a dot between the plot and its title; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. in short, "watching the detectives" is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine.bloodymonday rating: 1.5/4

lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them.unfortunately 'watching the detectives (2007)' offers only one to both actors and audience alike: not to fall asleep during a mind-numbingly boring, very predictable and unimaginative story.'watching the detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule.after a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and relatives, is even hinted at, not to mention actually happening.i'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old b&w film she couldn't care less about. 'watching the detectives (2007)' is nowhere near category b, it falls somewhere between q & r, like -questions? and -repress the questions! the director knows what he's doing! well, if his goal was to bore the viewer to death, he has done a very good job!'watching the detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy, bur please don't let it be a waste of your time!rating: 0 out of 100.

basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns. watching the detectives has none of that.the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads, not to mention the lack of any real visual story-telling style. i mean, this film is centered around movies, yet is itself incredibly uncinematic! that's a major failing right there.but the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (murphy and liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way. so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem, well, not terribly interesting.oh, yeah, another thing: for a romantic comedy? it's not funny. and the romance isn't terribly romantic, either.so avoid it. even at its 90-something minute running time it's just not worth sitting through...

i'm not even gonna waste time on this one; it's not funny, not scary, practically unwatchable and only occassionaly gory(the fx suck though(no pun intended)). this is a disclaimer; watch at your peril! ask yourself 1 question; are slugs scary?

just kidding! this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen! it was so bad though, that it was hilarious. my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad. cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs. the plot stunk, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was horrendous. but i sure had a blast watching it!

is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. so in that respect, imdb's average voting score is spot on.a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of "falcon crest" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.the slugs involved are originals from asturias, northern spain, but as they were not allowed into the united states, plastic ones had to be made. however, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather weirdly with parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other us forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). the actors involved were also a rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, horrifying, horrible or just simple awful.as a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as chapter 17,000 of coronation street or the latest news from baghdad.

in all of low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst. true ther are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just plain awful. i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs. i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man. this was rather amusing.

rodney dangerfield is a great. he has done a lot of great works. but this one....is awful. the whole plot is whack. it could have been much better. the jokes in the movie aren't funny....their stupid. this was very not so hilarious. he can do much better than this.

having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered, having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - i simply couldn't believe it: the movie is really awful. in fact it is so awful, that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced(!). during this, i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. the pattern is as follows: take one extremely popular comedian, make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners), and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that, and you have a success! i wouldn't know if this movie was a success, but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly (with a few great comedians) it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us.

unbelievably awful film. i watched part of this on t.v. recently. my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel. not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield's body, slap him around and scream, "how could you?" i know many films are done in haste, hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. but please, hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. it's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe. the bottom of the cesspool, even by sunday afternoon television standards.

if you want to see women's breasts, get a porno. there is no plot, but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan. the only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny, and, yes, boobs are boobs.

i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "malibu express." with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. the plot written by sidaris, which was ungratefully passed up by the academy, is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns. the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy. cleverly, ksxy is actually their secret headquarters. in "fit to kill" they confront their long-time nemesis kane, who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds. a well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come. it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized. i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking. the costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking. it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself. my personal rating is 10/10. the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero. andy, keep up the good work.

this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i've ever seen, and that's saying something. the chant of viva chiba, viva chiba is heard at the title, soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid, stupid. the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them, of course that's our man sonny chiba. the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords. a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard, but what are her true intentions? let me say at this point who cares? soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment. sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills, end of story. oh yeah the woman was corrupt too. congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever.as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen. what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be. some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film. that's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it's beyond funny. i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70's karate scene was at the time. watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student (bad editing) punching him in the throat. but everything is badly done in this film. terrible unbelievable fights, fake i mean fake blood, bad acting, dubbing, wardrobe, and let's not forget the story. one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country? i bet. fight after fight is laughable. this was the 70's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight, but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie. let's see he kicks a gun in half, kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene, give me a break. not to mention the fact that it's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it's filmed so poorly. one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture. ok. as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood, really fake blood. too say it looked poorly made is and understatement. the acting is totally non existent in this film. i don't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good, but it wasn't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor. was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent? as expected from a 70's wardrobe you'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks. also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time? don't try and hide it now. the characters were stupid as well. the pimp club owner's one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie. also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling. it was very annoying.overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making. that doesn't mean that it's not entertaining. with a film made so poorly it's hard not to laugh through most of this film, if you can stomach it. this was an old favorite watch with my best friend. if it was purely bad i would give one star, but the laughs it delivers bumps it up. 4 out 10.

i really hope that concorde/new horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror, or even action movie when they made carnosaur 3. the movie is flat-out silly from start to finish. even the humor in c3 is funny because it's bad. definitely a high water mark in the 'so bad it's good' genre. if you enjoy the very worst of the worst, this is for you.

this is probably one of the worst "wanna be a low budget hit films" to credit the dinosaur genre. the film is so predictable you could go away, cook yourself dinner, go answer the phone or whatever and when you're back you'll know exactly what has happened. the special effects are so poor you would have thought lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator. the acting is over cooked. they try so hard, yet there just isn't enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist... yeah okay we know exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses. stereotypical was created for films like this. if you want to watch this film, i suggest you aren't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were. and if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, don't watch it, you might break the screen - the facts are that far off.

this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch! i should have expected it, after seeing the first two, but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of "maybe they did it right this time". nope - not even close.where do i begin? how about with the special effects... to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie, at one point a soldier is shooting at a "raptor" as it runs down a hallway. even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around. bad bad bad bad.how about the acting? if that's what you can call it. there is one character who, i suppose, is supposed to be from the south. however, after living in the south for six years now, i have never heard this way of talking. perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally. i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one.how about the plot? it's pretty basic - raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them down. i'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey? oh well, at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them.other things - let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - army or marine? and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - split up into groups of two. didn't they ever watch any horror movies (or at least an episode of scooby doo)? in short, this is one of the dumber movies out there. miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie.

primal species (1996, dir. jonathan winfrey) international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs. the army commando team now have to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles.you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film. that is pretty much it. the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters. the story is poor, with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. this film came out three years after 'jurassic park'. instead, this film looks to have come out 13 years before 'jurassic park'. the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and i do mean costumes. there are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempts at hiding this. a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the creature. the is one good thing, which comes out of this film. the short running time. at only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether."it's like a friday the 13th nightmare." - officer (brian currie)

in general i like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap. no script, no dialogues, no acting. and the brave colonel rance trying to show he is tough and so curving his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid proctor from the police academy. so this was a complete waste of time (fortunately not waste of money as i saw the film on tv). and i really cannot understand 7 people who graded this sh*t 10. they must've joked. my advice, if you see this title run from it!

this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen... it is humorous how bad it is.. the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing..(i've seen porno's with a better plot) when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away. but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it .. i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean. i couldn't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower

if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema, if you've never seen a "moving picture" before, you'll think this movie is a child of the gods. but if you've seen a movie, a tv show, even barney the dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed by this film. heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick.now i like b movies. i just watched "the giant gila monster" right before i watched this swill, and i liked that movie much better. it works as a b movie. it has lamer dialog,hokier acting, cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real gila monster as the monster! carno 3 just doesn't pack much of a b movie punch. it has some gore, and that polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming, almost....flaccid. it's the little engine that couldn't of dinosaur movies. i'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained. if you're one of those people, then give this movie a shot.

this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. i rented it as a joke, expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes, and let me just say i've never laughed so hard in my life. the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life. this is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and doesn't mean to at all) of the action genre. i didn't see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, i don't think there's to much i missed. if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy, than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours

like all carnosaur movies, this is a joke. the way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake-looking than they were.the plot had no sense whatsoever. i mean, first they're on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they're on a boat. and let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a ship? i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. it sounds stupid even when you think about it.the only reason for which i gave this a 3, is because it's still entertaining. i found it better than the first one (haven't watched the second yet). just, don't rent it. i saw it on tv and it's a good thing i did because i wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it.

this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema: two or more separate stories rolled into one film. other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the "first part" and "second part". how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didn't "end", it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!) i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with!

for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, i first offer these four words: don't waste your time! "chungking express" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong burger king. i can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! it's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that "tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up"). the same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. the shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature i could have done without. and if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60's ode "california dreaming" by the mamas and papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company, though i cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. he was known to have remarked, "i'm happy to love a movie this much." a lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.

i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who are, otherwise, quite sensible.there is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.the most easily explained example of this is the director's use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music. in the first half, a really dull reggae tune is played about three times (when once is too often). but in the second half, the mommas and the papas "california dreamin'" is played at least seven times, usually at top volume. godsakes, whether you liked the song or not beforehand, you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end. just think, some people claim to have seen this film four or five times. this means they've listened to california dreamin either 28 or 35 times.....all of this needless hyper-repetition (it contributes nothing to the story) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit, or if the story was in any way involving.but it ain't.the only aspect i found likeable was bridgette lin's charging around and still playing asia the invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. even this wore off fairly quickly.i'm sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it.i can only warn you - if you've never seen a hk movie before, don't start with this one.if you feel compelled to watch it, avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema. the fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here.you have been warned !

i very much looked forward to this movie. its a good family movie; however, if michael landon jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. too many scenes out of context. i do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. but, if another one is made, i beg them to take better care at editing. this story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. i enjoy the story of willie and missy; they're both great role models. plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.

this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched.this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause. that is why he went insane? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever? and that's not the only thing. i'm being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie. nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by.there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him. it's a friggin minute long. who the hell wants to see that? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it. so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history. and i'm serious about that.it's not even so good its bad, it's tedious, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the vcr. it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second. you want to know how bad this movie is? i'd rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again.

going into a movie like i this, i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills.....what i got was even less.christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit. horrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe.....cept for the fact he's obsessed with santa. after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane, dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss. an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, he drives his van off a cliff.....into the moon. not the best ending i've seen but it was original.it was a slow paced, boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers. there was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scenes were toned down.too boring......4 out of 10

why, oh, why won't they learn? when you've got a nice, juicy exploitation gimmick, use it! don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; you're only gonna wind up looking foolish.christmas evil is the story of harry stadling, who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing (daddy-dressed-as-)santa claus back when he was a kid. so, of course, harry grows up obsessed with christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he flips out, dresses as santa, and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children, and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (after all, how many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) unfortunately, this film wants to be more "santa, portrait of a serial killer" than "silent night, deadly night". two-thirds of the film are spent documenting harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling. you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.perhaps harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we've got some guy named lewis jackson. apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. the action jumps giddily from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.even once the film gets rolling, we're still treated to heaping helpings of harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. more depressing than frightening, christmas evil is one to avoid.

this was a movie i could not wait to see! so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed. for starters,the movie has so little said about new york,just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings,streets,bridges and cafes.it really doesn't stay focused on the new york magic.another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.i know that it is a remake,but it is not a french style remake! anyway,here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies,such as long and messy scenes,no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! the story follows many lives ( too many for my taste) and they somehow seem connected in the end. i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories. the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending.so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.and there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast !

i've never been to paris, but after seeing "paris, je t'aime" i'm crazy to visit this city! i've been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs. i kinda expected to be touched by this film, to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away, but, lo and behold, i regret the time and money i spent with it. there are no love stories between people or a person and the city. there's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine. maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own. can't you find love in new york?

i've seen all four of the movies in this series. each one strays further and further from the books. this is the worst one yet. my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "love's abiding joy." the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (willie, missie, henry, clark, scottie and cookie). the names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. the entire story line is no where in the book.i find it a great disservice to janette oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. the music is too loud. the actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.if you want a good family movie, this might do. it is clean. don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. i hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but i doubt it. if there are more movies made, i wish michael landon, jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. the books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!

i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was. first off, the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots. there are no black or gay new yorkers in love? or who, say, know the self-involved white people in love? i know it's not the love crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness but you can't pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society. plus, you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham-handed oscar, so where is everyone? possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs? me either). this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst. bad acting, bad writing, bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants. but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion. and, side note, uma dodged a bullet; ethan hawke looks ravaged. this, of course, is one thing in terms of his looks, but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor, lovely maggie q.i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire, but it has to be the anton yelchin/ olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste, which saddens me because i really like those two actors. i don't consider myself easily offended, but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt. a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeouf's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie. i don't mean opposite, i mean against. against is the only explanation. i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight. highlight. please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits, which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world. this film is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all. (the extra star is for the cloris leachman/ eli wallach sequence, as it is actually quite sweet, but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless, masturbatory torment.)

having loved 'paris, je t'aime', i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations, but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.although, i was not expecting a re-make of 'paris' in new york i was expecting the same structure. what i liked about 'paris' was the breakup of the neighborhoods. you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell. in 'ny', there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on. also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.another thing i loved about the 'paris' film was the different takes on love. it wasn't all romantic. there was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman yearning for love etc., it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. 'ny' seemed to only go for an edgy, over-the-top sexuality. there were some redeemable shorts (the older couple having spent a lifetime together, julie christie's short), but overall the'ny' film didn't evoke any emotion for me. i didn't connect with any of the characters like i did with 'paris'. i remember watching 'paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder... it just had so much soul. for me, there was no soul in the 'ny' film.maybe if i had gone into it without having 'paris' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a self-titled re-take of 'paris, je t'aime' i was sorely disappointed.

(i'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin.) my dissatisfaction is split: 30% tone-deafness, 70% lackluster writing.the 30%: i agree with the first commenter's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. i was surprised how, this film, at best, woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it's inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl (this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl). a few minority characters are written into the stories, but they are included by obligation, while we can see the gears under the film so clearly, striving to "be diverse" but falling ever-so-short.the 70% is why everything falls short. all characters, white plus a few token minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts of people concepts. worse, their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i'd say is a "gag": we get a basic conceit, then some punchline intended to be a clever twist. but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say, "okay, that was a surprise"...the stories are still not that interesting, because they, too, are shallow. when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending, you're writing jokes.spoilers below...the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories. that's fine. but romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. these "romantic" stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other. words exchange, thoughts are projected through voice-over, but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another.meaning, there is no seduction (in the broad sense), no tension, and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other. the only story involving a superficial "seduction" is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy (ethan hawke) gets outwitted by the girl he's hitting on, who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker. sure, his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we'd be if we were next to them, but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of "a then b". so it unfolds, if something like a postcard could "unfold", with all the other tales as well: a then b--that's it, the only point being that these happen to occur "on set" in manhattan. by the way, the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch; the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village.it's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. _new york, i love you_, however, deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title. we expect to see the real new york, and real new yorkers, but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic, its characters flown in from the o.c., plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity. but when we look closer at who those characters are, the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent.for example, the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park, who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny (male nanny) when in fact he's the father. notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic-construction point of view (it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend/stepfather are strutting the girl away), it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl's father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. what, the dad can't be just some guy from south america? now that he's obviously hot, is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle-to-upper-class white woman? are we that naive as to require such? as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable.it's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. but in every conceivable set-up and plot twist, the direction taken screams status quo, appeals to safety. all these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we were forced to keep the single-dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them, at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy? how 'bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead. again, i'm not saying the entire conceit has to be changed. it's just that every. damn. story premise. is so hackneyed--and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york, outside the trite. the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading.i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack, the good pacing of the movie (even if what was being paced was, well, dredge), and the general feel of many of the scenes. the movie was just fine to sit through, and i wouldn't dissuade anyone from doing so. however, it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrased) "that's what i love about new york: everyone's from a different place." well, you wouldn't know it from watching this one.

when i bought this dvd i though: "it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards let's give it a chance" i was totally wrong! what a disappointing movie! first, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many portuguese soap operas! second, the plot is so boring, and leads nowhere it has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one or another direction the production is also bad! the sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80's the acting should have been better too well, to sum up, it's not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve! in fact, it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years! bad argument, bad acting, bad production i had no high hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than i've ever imagined! just forget about it!

just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival. just before going i came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty nice rate...after 15 minutes i was dying to get out (never did this), but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening.i did not like at all, the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogs, nothing lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie. despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! all of this would be bearable if the plot, characters, romances, anything was good, but was bad, really bad! a "don't know how to do" sex-in-the-city.don't waste your time or money.

this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of "they saved hitler's brain" the worst movie i have ever seen period. when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with. the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy. the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness. the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor. the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street. the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness. the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering "there is no difference" with a french accent was, well you get my point.the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute. this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high. well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's. if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine. there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie. of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was.

stephen feinberg, who played the proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, passed away in early 2006. i met steve in portland in 1993, it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in hollywood years earlier, working mostly on tv promos. he asked me not to see 'tunnel vision', but it was too late, i had seen it already! actually i had seen it years before, when it was released. at that time i didn't think it was that bad a movie. however seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated. steve admitted it was not a very good movie. that said he was just a little proud of 'the proctologist' sketch.

saturday night live, national lampoon, and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film.however, it is very interesting to watch now, at the start of 2005. twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true: there is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something called "the pregnant man" which came true with arnold schwarzenegger's dumb movie "junior" there is a commercial spoof, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something featuring sammy davis jr. and jackie onasis called "celebrity wrestling" which has now come true with a popular show called "celebrity boxing" there is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, that features john candy in a movie about a severed head. watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to frank hellenlotter's basket case!! and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about "a dead dream, the only two left ..." the name of the documentary is ... the last hippies! lol.four prophecies come true!

:spoilers:i was very disappointed in love's abiding joy. i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re-aired thursday night on hallmark. i love the first three "love" movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be. the whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all.i think the script writers should have went more by the book. it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke's writings. i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it. and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that love's abiding joy is my least favorite. i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't so bland. i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.

when i rented this i was hoping for what "reign of fire" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.instead i got a standard "monster hunts stupid people in remote building" flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. bad, bad, bad.only reason why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies. in theory.....

well, i just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because i was bored and needed a laugh. i have to admit, i did chuckle a few times, but i don't even remember what parts they were at. i don't understand why this movie was made. it claims to be a comedy but seriousuly, i don't find a singing penis, or a naked 70 year old woman very funny. this movie was trying to fit itself into the 'gross-out' comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip, but it just failed miserably. it was way to much gross-out then it was comedy. also, why on earth did cameron diaz attach her name to this movie?!?! the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool. i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done. besides that, avoid this movie. 3/10

there's a lot of movies that have set release dates, only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind, and then put in limbo for a long time. you can only wish a film as rotten as "slackers" remained in a coma for what it's worth, which is miniscule. release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves. the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan, a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela. ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela. i don't like to give spoilers out, but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception. angela falls for david, ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win. that's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre. gross humor is funny, it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic "animal house", to the likes of contemporaries like "there's something about mary" and "road trip" amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention. but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far, case in point, ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it. no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself. no one wants to watch a young man singing "she'll be coming around the mountain" with a sock on his penis. but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50's bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old. i don't know if it's the story's lack of coherence, which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense. director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer, and after reviewing this film, you can only wish he'll go back to the profession. the worst thing you can do on any film, is to make it look like you're having fun, because you detract from your objectives, just like "slackers" does, by burying it's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags, pointless vignettes, and lack of construction. it's like a bunch of college students got drunk, took one's camcorder, and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together. if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that's actually good, then i suggest "american pie" and "animal house", or "road trip", just something that's entertaining, and not dreadfully bad like "slackers". coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film, just as she did in another bad film such as "the sweetest thing" where the story treats gross humor like another plot, instead of a device much like this disaster.. if you pass by "slackers" at your local video store, just keep on walking, and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role. i was physically ill after watching this film. i really don't understand hollywood sometimes. there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best. that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge. the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film. glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv. this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost.

it was so terrible. it wasn't fun to watch at all. even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator, even that's not fun to watch in this movie. i say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched, just girl on couch using a vibrator. maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters, maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level. my advice, fast forward to that point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, rewind, repeat. maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way. this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen.

this was the worst movie i have ever seen! molly (molly hall) could not act at all! she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book. the smart kid and the kid who loves food (there names weren't worth remembering) were so annoying it drove me crazy.when ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food. mollys dad didn't show enough emotion about his daughter missing. the police officer and mollys dad said the same thing like four times. it was just horrible. everything was repeated way to much. beatrice should have had something bad happen to her for being so mean. i just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie!

one of the worst movies i've ever seen. acting was terrible, both for the kids and the adults. most to all characters showed no, little or not enough emotion. the lighting was terrible, and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot (in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed, there's 4 shots; the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat, jillian and molly in the evening swimming, the rest of the kids in the daytime *when it's supposed to in the evening* at the river bank, and the doctor, beatrice, and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat.) the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff, cappy (although, there's a slip of character when the pulse detector *whatever that thing is when people die, it beeps* shows cappy has died, he still moves while it can still be heard beeping, and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually, then it shows the pulse again, and then he finally dies.) i guess it's not going to be perfect, since it's an independent movie, but it still could be better. not worth watching, honestly, even for kids. might as well watch something good, like the lion king or toy story if you're going to see anything you'll remember.

i was aware of rohmer's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts, and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures (as renoir's or chaplin's very last movies ; yes, the "politique des auteurs" also has its dark side). but with "les amours d'astrée et de céladon", it's as if rohmer himself wanted, for what may be his last movie, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a last senile movie, by adapting urfé's "l'astrée", with ridiculous aesthetic codes, witch just look like a parody of rosselini's last movies (the ones he made for tv from descartes or marx's lives).in his version of "perceval", rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re-transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things. the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved, and films actors, dressed like 1600's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes. but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees. it's not that the story itself is stupid, but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny (and i'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors, the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly, the ridiculous soft-erotic tone, the poor musical tentatives, or the strange fascination for trasvestisment!).the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke, which mixes a soft-erotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions (sic !). at the beginning of the movie, rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity, and that's why he had to film "l'astrée" in other parts of the country. however, i'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting, if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions. this film may interest a few historians, but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmer's movie.

i rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. i don't think i ever finished it. it is worse than a home video made by a high school student. i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer suv, like a toyota rav-4 or something (i don't remember). i don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. he might have had a cell phone too, i cant remember, it was just horrible. i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back. to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen some pretty bad ones.

lynn hollister, a small-town lawyer, travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny. (yes, lynn is a man despite the feminine-sounding christian name. were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that john wayne's birth name was "marion"?) hollister at first believes johnny's death to have been an accident, but soon realises that johnny was murdered. further investigations reveal a web of corruption, criminality and election rigging connected to boss cameron, the leading light in city 's political machine.that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller, possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941. it isn't. "a man betrayed", despite its theme, is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama. hollister falls in love with cameron's attractive daughter sabra, and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements.this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama. one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer, but he couldn't play a cowboy in every movie, and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass. where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant impersonator. romantic comedy just wasn't up his street. one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them, regardless of whether it was up their street or not, and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could.that said, not even cary grant himself could have made "a man betrayed" work as a comedy. that's not a reflection on his comic talents; it's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film. i doubt if anyone, no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be, could find anything to laugh at in it. the film's light-hearted tone doesn't make it a successful comedy; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else. this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. 3/10

really, i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie. i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. it had zombies in it right? was i wrong! to be honest the movie had it's moments...i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.

one wonders how the script came to be written.wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy, romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile. it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war. i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.nonetheless it has historical value.

all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period, and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. once you get that message, you may as well switch to another film.davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's idealized beyond reason. a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzman's fall from mount rushmore. in rushmore, schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome, but here it's his character's only quality. schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role; here's hoping his choices improve.

i really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them. they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (remember "candy"?). the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. the story here has a european sci-fi film called "dragonfly" being made and the director is fired. so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (jeremy davies) to complete the picture. they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she's barely in it. film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law (barbarella). gerard depardieu, giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well. i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties. if any are reading this, "make it as sexy as you can"! i'll be waiting!

from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper. "cq" tells a lame, disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a babe, and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick. i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making. (d)

i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans, but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie.i don't understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else did,if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards.most fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up baby.here the director or writers try to rehash the idea,but it fails miserably.i've read comments about how "creepy" drake was,but i thought that was far too mild a description. franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungover.a casting disaster is one thing.this film is a total disaster.this one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and i don't know why that's a requirement.too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults.unless you want to torture someone,give this one a wide berth.

stalker is right! girl sees guy, girl wants guy, girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him, girl won't leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can't stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying, girl still won't leave him alone. played right, drake's character could have been charming but she's completely, wholly, unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant's character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, drake's attempt at playing, "charmingly screwball" comes off as, "disturbingly demented." grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as i've ever seen from him. the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim.screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt, it just stinks. worse still, drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order. she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic.

one-note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge. department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage, pinning her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant. the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry. i guess the word "perky" just about sum's up drake's approach to the role. she does have a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, i began to overdose. grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. there is one scene, however, that almost salvages this slender exercise. drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies. here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable, and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes, the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day-dream, circa 1948.

heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas: it's desperate to teach us a civics lesson, and it won't stop until we've passed the final exam. fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), have a spat with their senator (eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace. henry wallace!! a year later, he was considered a near communist dupe, but in 1944, he was a-ok. add in some truly awful musical moments, a whole lot of flagwaving hooey, and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters, and you've got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2: d.c. boogaloo. drastically unfun, heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.

the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german (post)war movies. it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet. however, the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés. it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'pearl harbor'.luise kielberg (bettina zimmermann) gets to hear that her husband, who is a doctor, (ulrich noethen) has died in russia and after the war she's struggling to survive. she finds a job at the american base, gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer (heino ferch) in town, falls in love with 'm, gets pregnant, and all of a sudden her husband turns up again. come on!!! we've seen this once too often. heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well; bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince. for some reason it always seems she's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes. it just didn't work for me.the action scenes with the planes and the air lift, we're sometimes exciting, more often not. nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot.unless you're a big fan of wwii movies, i suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice-cream brings a lot more satisfaction!4 out 10!

a few weeks ago the german broadcaster "sat1" advertised this movie as the "tv-event of the year" - sorry, but i've seen better things on tv this year.i didn't thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial - namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar: the "heroine" (if i can really call her that) in the middle and her two "loved-ones" next to her - pearl harbor, anyone? in fact the love-story is a poor man's version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poor!but as i like watching movies and analyzing their patterns i eventually decided to watch that rubbish. the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third reich promising his wife that he will return. now fast forward to spring 1948: germany lost the war and the allies & russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies: capitalism versus communism. well, i guess you already know the story because you have to know it - the movie doesn't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts. the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they're trying to help.what was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine's mother tells her daughter that germany might be parted in two with a response like: "that's impossible!" or when stalin (where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him) says that russia has to stop "coca cola" from spreading in germany. yeah right, if stalin has ever said something like this. or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it - please! burgers were invented way before that time.in the movie you once see a map showing the airlines, funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer - in '48. the us general lucius clay who's main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character phillip turner, the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects: not enough african-american soldiers in the movie, there were like two in the whole film! also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier would've been sent home. i don't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married, if it wasn't for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fire!if it wasn't enough all americans in this movie spoke accent-free german although they only were in germany for a couple of months - look i'm also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent. notably bad was also the child acting - the kids had like two expressions on their faces: "normal-i-look-monotonous-like-a-robot" and grinning.all in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue. the sad part is that the movie was very successful - 8.97 millions watched the first part and 7.83 millions the second part the day after thus sat1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group. but like i always think: the biggest pile of bull-crap is where the most flies go to.

what a fantastic premise: a movie about the berlin airlift. it should have it all. tragedy. suspense. comradeship. rivals. berliner frauleins and tough us pilots. love and tears. what we've got, is a film with none of the above. heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so, but he fails miserably. he acts so wooden, that at any given moment he should crack. he tries to play the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! why would bettina zimmermann's character fall in love with him? cause they were throwing stones in a lake? cause he brings her coal bricks? the sfx are very, very well done. too much though. the hundreds or so planes over berlin, look like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was. interestingly enough, the white house, the kremlin, and general lucius d. clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. notice the same drapes, hanging deep down the windows, as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty? by the way, general lucius d. clay, comes across as a small time, insecure, looser general, who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift. he was very much the opposite. so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion, no suspense and no historic accuracy. sad, it started out so promising

to put it simply, i am not fond of westerns. and having never sat through one from beginning to end, i decided to watch "my darling clementine" and see it all the way through, no matter how painful it was for me. at first it was excruciating as expected. i found the acting to be laughable, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful. however, after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on, after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure. focusing in on the cinematography, and how john ford managed to make even the dullest situations (dull according to me that is) look quite stunning at times, made it a lot more interesting. in conclusion, i can't go so far as to say that i enjoyed the movie by the end of it. however it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end, and that in itself impresses me.

i thought they should have called this movie "whites" instead of "heights". godawful...the kind of film that makes people hate new yorkers. people who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so important...give me a break. such a lily white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it, this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal it...and so they introduce, get this, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (i thought he was an albino at first)who's supposed to be welsh!i'm still trying to decipher that accent! intellectually dishonest...this movie is the kind of film that's able to fool so many people into thinking it's worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious. better to fill the theaters with mi5-10 than with this pretentious crap...must have been a better play because you can't fall off the floor.

one star for the "plot". one star for the acting. one star for the dubbing into squeaky-voiced american. five stars for monica broeke and inge maria granzow, with their propensity for taking all their clothes off. and ten out of ten for the divine emmanuelle béart, two years before she made 'manon des sources'. béart also undresses a couple of times, but even fully-clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three "first times" for a girl. it's corny, but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed "love scenes" featuring broeke, granzow and patrick bauchau. incidentally, the cinematography is not great; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of.

this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's "hippie mentality" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. a naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( kay lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in "love" with him. if you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. she keeps saying how much she "loves" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. avoid this if you can. grade d.

the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood, whose work i admire immensely. the leads had absolutely no chemistry. not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them. the story just didn't ring true. add to that stilted conversation, tons of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere, and you've got yourself a real stinker. kay lenz's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare, but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time. my thoughts as i watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled "cheesy."

this is a terrible film, and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion. the characters are uninflected, obviously drawn, predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish fulfillment.william holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made, but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. kay lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive. i think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection.holden's character--the same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film, (not) coincidentally--is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre-hippie cool: the bachelor pad, the swinging hi-fi, the lunches at yamashiro. but the film is ridiculously uncool, a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big honkin' cars sexy.ugh. youth culture was never that desperate. and i shudder to think that bill holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part.

trifling romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie (kay lenz) and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years (william holden, surprisingly affable within this highly-concocted arrangement). the script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages; still, the scenario is such a middle-aged cliché by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile. it may have worked much better with different leads: holden and lenz don't match up well (her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her), making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable. dated, blurry-romantic, and mostly unmemorable. ** from ****

you have a strong stomach. holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years. at one point holden said, "i am over twice your age." okay, try triple grandpa! the "old enough to be your father" theme they were shooting for didn't work. granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens. more power to them, but that doesn't mean i want to watch it. it's not a matter of judgment but the digestive track. i like my food where it belongs. lenz is fun to watch and the 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc. make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed. it would have been nice to see the blonde friend of lenz, the one who hocked her guitar, get more scenes. pleasingly spacey... who was this chick? i'm going to try and find out.

i thought the movie was a poor documentary. nothing of substance was discussed. it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new. the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science. most scientists appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes weird. a woman said that her awards didn't matter a whole lot, only children that were helped. she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards. playing "humble scientist", are we? "i have equations dancing in my head," another said. i don't see how that explains anything to us. it hasn't covered significant effects of science on our culture. politics of science were barely touched.not a bad flick for a 10-14 year-olds. other than that, i felt it was boring and unrevealing.4/10

this movie is really bad. the acting is plain awful except michael ironside. i don't get the story. richard grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two mc-gangs. he comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian-land. at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home-town, i didn't hear that in the movie, if so it wasn't clear.richard grieco was one hell of a bad actor. stiff and ugly. he said his lines like it too. and we wouldn't talk about sean young, she hasn' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with bolt (grieco). she is awful.when i rented it i choosed between this and subterfuge with amanda pays. i choosed this one because of michael ironside was in the cast. maybe i should have taken subterfuge.don't see this unless you think richard grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses.i will soon uptade the cast-list because i have it at home. i wrote it down after i seen the movie.

this is the page for "house of exorcism", but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece, "lisa & the devil", which explains the ridiculously high rating for this, "house of exorcism." when "lisa & the devil" was shown at film festivals in the early 70's, it was a critical success. audiences responded well to that gorgeous, gothic horror film. unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time, and was considered too unusual, and not commercial enough for mass consumption. no distributor would buy it. so producer alfredo leone decided to edit 'lisa', seemingly with a chainsaw, by removing just about half of the original film, and adding new scenes, which he filmed two years after the original product! it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new, hideous additions, so technically "house of exorcism" is not a bava film. the original product is a slow, dreamy, classy production. a few minutes into the film, the viewer is jarred out of this dream world, as suddenly we see lisa, (two years older, and with a very different haircut), begin to writhe on the ground, making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like "suck my co@k", etc. subtle, huh? and the film continues like this, jumping back and forth between a beautiful, visual film, and a grade z "exorcist" rip-off. leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes, while keeping some semblance of a story intact. he failed miserably. when the choice was made to basically destroy "lisa and the devil", bava himself refused, saying that his film was too beautiful to cut. he was right, and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet. it was many years before the original "lisa and the devil" was seen again, re-surfacing on late night television. i had seen "lisa" long before i saw this new version, and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films "vandalised" in this way. worth seeing only for curiosity sake. otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague.

this movie was bizarre, completely inexplicable, and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house. i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city. i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale, though maybe not in a low budget horror flick. definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out (in my dvd copy anyway). don't attempt to understand it, just go along and watch out for the weird bits...which is everything. don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense. pretty beautiful, though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie, like say, dead alive.

best of the best 4, is better than 3, but just barely. basically, i say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1/2 (like 3 does), (ie. their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings).anyway, i liked the russian plot line of the story, and especially sven ole-thorsen's bit part as boris. aside from that though and a few fighting scenes, the movie is nothing special. the limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the airplane blow-up scene).also, part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did, there are a couple of more better known actors (hudson, thorsen) in part 4, but alas nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles).alas, it seems best of the best is the rhee show, and to be truthful, he cannot carry a movie.saw on tape, rating:4

**spoilers** i rented "tesis" (or "thesis" in english) on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort "the others". based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror. instead i wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film "anatomie" (which this one kinda reminded me of).the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes. it revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student angela's (ana torrent - a jessica harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. angela, and her horror-buff friend chema (fele martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it.this leads to... well, nothing.they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls. there is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and b) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. the rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.seriously - amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life. the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. in "tesis", *potential spoiler ahead* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says "ok, ya got me, it was him after all"! as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck. you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after.the only thing that drags "tesis" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say "look at me! i'm political!". the final scenes, in which the "point" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. if he doesn't, he certainly should. this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff.overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. the urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films ("videodrome" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: "my little eye")... "tesis" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. on every level, this one is better left dead and buried. i'll award it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.

when i saw the commercial for this, i was all about seeing it. now, forgive me, but it's been so long since i've seen it that i don't recall how it went. suffice it to say, the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the "movie" they sold me on.i was bored, annoyed, and incredibly disappointed by this movie. and if it wasn't bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music. not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon? i guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, i suppose) you may think this is some hot stuff. for my money, the commercial was way better.

a bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all-night horror movie marathon. however, as the night goes on, there's somebody among them killing them off one by one. who is it...and why? i saw this in a theatre way back in 1991. i was looking forward to it--but boy! it did not work at all. the premise is a good one, they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like dee wallace stone on board...but it doesn't work. the story stops making sense halfway through (that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (how this got an r rating is beyond me) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid.it's really too bad--this movie had potential. with a better script this could have become a great horror film. as it stands though it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it (i heard stone won't talk about this one). i give it a 3 and that's just for the cast.

the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom-adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie. as usual tom villard is good, too. otherwise it's c**p. the possesor doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out "the possessor"? lame.

i suppose many people comment/review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- i'm writing due to the latter.i was excited for the sequel to "wargames" .. i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, i felt it was worth watching more than once. this being 2008, i had high hopes for what they would do with this film. computers, gaming, terror, military over-zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film, and "wargames: the dead code" had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick.the movie failed on pretty much every level, but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects. "the dead code" was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms. meanwhile, will farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands -- none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen. until finally he "wins" by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody is near the gas). because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes, this tells ripley (the real life war machine) that he is a high level terror threat.even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity. they say things like "he has expert knowledge of bio-terror" ... he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio-terror. so then a movie-long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues. they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter.. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him.. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.ugh... i would write more.. but i already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.

i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said. honestly i have only myself to be angry with. i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but i loved war games so i indulged my whim. i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. the list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it. to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.

let's face it-- if you rented a stdvd sequel of a forgotten 80's gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot. wargames: the dead code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the dvd market has filled so easily. movies like this don't need spoilers, because you already know them.the "plot" for this "film", is as follows: nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the "film"; nerd and girl are captured; the top secret government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat top secret government computer; nerd beats top secret computer by using the same old top secret computer from the first wargames "film"; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. the end.the acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect-- b-grade. some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of colm feore, then you should avoid this one. granted, the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking stdvd sequels, then you are right at home.sadly, mathew broderick was too involved with some "masterpiece", that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one. but can you blame him?

i didn't enjoy this film. i thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring. a 20year old computer saving the day? i thought that this was just slightly far fetched, even for a film. i couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it.its a shame, but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered. this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film, it wasn't. if that is what you want to watch, do not watch this film! even if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day, this would still, in my opinion, be a very very cheesy flick..

will farmer (lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and ripley, the super government computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, tracks him because will borrowed (by hacking) some money from his next door neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in philadelphia. the next door neighbor whose computer will was fixing, has relatives in the mid-east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor's bank , and ripley sees a terrorist connection. ripley has the power to call up missile strikes. oh, oh!this version of war games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the war games movie in the early 1980s. well, the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days. makes sense. so the movie dazzles us with fantastic cgi on computer screens, and once joshua, the forerunner to ripley, is found operational, we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing, hoping, praying.sort of, oh-oh-ing, omg-ing, and more cringing hoping things will go their way. in other words we are now experiencing a made-for-tv type movie, and it's oh hum time. go back to the 1980s and watch the original war games movie. it's much better. but, we really have to ask ourselves: are we making computers too intelligent where one day, in time, they will rule us? hmmm..violence: yes. sex: no. nudity: no. language: no.

if you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece. how could it be worse more you ask? well...at least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra. other than updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going. and for anyone that didn't see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once. maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again.

i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed. this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time. the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie "can it get any worse?" yes, it can! somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking "i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!". somebody got to pay for this! i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this...i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed. this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time. the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie "can it get any worse?" yes, it can! somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking "i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!". somebody got to pay for this! i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this...

i thought this was a sequel of some sorts, and it is meant to be to the original from 1983. but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it.i actually had very little expectations to this movie, but i just wasted 95 minutes of life. no suspense - i actually feel clairvoyant, poor acting, and so filled with technical errors, so i as a computer geek just couldn't believe it. they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie.do not see this movie, this is a complete waste of time. instead get the original. the theme is still valid. don't let to much power into a machine. and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling.

i'll try to use words to describe this on.... i saw the original, which was good in its own way, but back then i should have feared a sequel.and i was 'afraid' when i picked this one up, but now that i've seen it, i have to say, it's even worse then i thought. why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good, but it has to be said, some make heads turn by being just plain awful. but what can an actor do with a script like this one. it's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed, any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before, fails miserably. in a futile attempt to get it up-to-date, they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big-brother' theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original, but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad. in conclusion, if you have nothing , and i mean nothing , to do... go watch it, or play frisbee... with the dvd.... by yourself. it'll offer you the same amount of fun.. i promise

thank god i watched this at a friend's place and did not pay for it. the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show. if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, watch out. you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence. also, actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen, excluding porn. she's lucky that matt lanter is actually decent. he's the one that carries the movie. i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! it's a shame that they got to call it a sequel, because i was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.

like many others have commented before me here, i have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst i've seen. there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment, because i hate spoilers.i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something, where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on cgi (i've seen worse of those)... all in all, it is quite an insult to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and/or technology at all. there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and i found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through. in addition, there are countless "easy way out" scenarios, which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being...this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old "wargames", and i think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.two stars from me, because of one thing and one thing only: the actors' performances aren't half-bad, considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with. still, they should never have signed on to this movie. not really a career-move, but i guess we all have bills to pay.to those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's my only explanation.to all who haven't seen this one: by all means, watch it and make up your own mind. but lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).

i think this could've been a decent movie, and some of its parts are ok... but in whole it's a b movie. same about the plot, parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up. acting is mostly ok, i've seen worse of this too. :)the beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making "cool" but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (in slow motion! cool!), like the drivers had never seen sand before... it gets slightly better from there, but not much.if you're gonna rent this, get another one too and use this one as a warm-up. keep expectations low and it might work for you.

this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit . it's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a uav right at the start.and that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark. uav's aren't armed. they could be but i don't think it's ever been tried for real. we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called r.i.p.l.e.y. we are introduced to "hacker" will farmer (he's good at chemistry & electronics which doesn't make him a computer hacker) & his love interest, annie) & will's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was. we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical company.wills taking money from his neighbours bank account (mr massude) isn't a hack (he helped him set up the account), we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war & they play the dead code. the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massude's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will.exactly why ripley shut will's machine down isn't explained (he's only playing an online game?) & also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well. why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable. as for ripley activating his mobile phone? i think not, it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad "hacking" science there too.ripley agents arrive at massude's home, take him away & will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money. will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn't a "hack" as you never see him break into the dmv computer. the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he's looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him. will's mother hadn't "been stealing chemicals & bio agents" either. and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis. patriot act or not.i don't know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us.the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will, his mother & dennis wasn't sanctioned by a government agency. the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.the "guy" who ran into annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley & the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced, the joshua project. we discover that the "guy" who ran into annie is falken (not played by the original actor sadly) who faked his own death.we also get to see wopr as "what's going to help" them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then. falken & wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all (the same explosion should kill will, annie & the russian. it's also unlikely they'd create a self-contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.the whole "decontamination" plot & idea are totally unbelievable. those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff. so yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.the ip hacks against ripley aren't done by will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea. it's excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley's operating temperature. having joshua as a backdoor into ripley (especially after it had been blown to bits) is an incredible cop-out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown (saying 17 minutes) then ripley says "decontamination in 30 minutes", how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own timer? ripley's attack mission against philadelphia is halted (far too easily in my opinion) and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed. the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she's doing won't work (surely she'd already know if she had joshua insider her as he'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie?) is yet another nod back to the original movie.their cop-out at having ripley repeat joshua's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.if you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat & rob kerchner. this is an awful movie and is best avoided.

some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen, and i understand where they're coming from, but i really have seen worse.that being said, the movies that i can recall (ie the ones i haven't blocked out) that were worse than this, were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie. the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness.war games: the dead code isn't that bad, but it comes pretty close. yes i was a fan of the original, but no i wasn't expecting miracles from this one. let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.that's all i was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek-strings. was that too much to ask for? is it really not possible to do better than the original war games, even for a straight to video release? well apparently that was too much to ask for. stay away from this movie. at first it's just bad, like "oh yeah, this is bad, but i'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original." and then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me, you will wish you had not seen this movie.

i can't say that wargames: the dead code is the worst movie i've ever seen, as it had one or two decent moments, but i can easily say it's the most transparent movie i've ever seen. not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. there was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes. every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to "get into" the movie.i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie.

i see a lot of movies. saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. computers where still "a big mystery" for the most of us and the movie was convincing, in it's own way.this one, however, looks like a low budget wednesday night special. total crap, from start to finish.the plot is so weak, you won't believe it until you see the movie (which i would not recommend in the first place). i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie. but hey, with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting. lots of cliché scenes. cgi looks like it's taken out of the '86 version.bah, no, i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this. do not watch this movie.life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies.

it happened with assault on prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with the lost boys in 2008 and now it's happened with another classic from the 80's wargames... :( why, oh why, oh why won't hollywood ever learn? leave them alone...! they can't be remade...! they suck....! we all hate them....!.those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with matthew broderick & ally sheedy, go rent/buy it now....!! the hardware may look dated, the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down....for those of us who lived through the 80's when hacking was sexy, the internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8" floppy variety, well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a thermonuclear war! never before has "a nice game of chess" seemed the better option....

wow...this has got to be the dumbest movie i've ever seen. we watched it in english class...and this movie made absolutely no sense. i would never, ever watch this movie again...and my sympathy to those who have ever paid to see it.

certainly not horrible, but definitely not good.cry, the beloved country (1995) was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton). starring james earl jones and richard harris.the film is about pre-apartheid south africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo (james earl jones) receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. the rich farmer/landowner james jarvis (richard harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by kumalo's son. in this they connect.i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for i have not seen it. or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it; both look better than this one. but cry freedom, on the other hand, i have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry, the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going. very "wishy-washy". i refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.frankly, this movie blew. well, i guess it wasn't that bad, --five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn't that good either. both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, ronald harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime the pianist, and being julia). among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. the music doesn't help. the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. one upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much.the last, striking words of alan paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. i don't know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film.thanks for your time.

for the first time in years, i've felt the need to log into imdb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review, because it was just such a let-down to watch. the plot sounded awesome when i read it, i expected a minimal mystery thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. unfortunately, it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane, tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth-gnashingly stupid "no-one-says-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movies"-dialogs that it's just agonizing.here's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film: - the script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughable. no, actually, it's angering. and lazy.- related to that: cheap thrills. a long parade "just in time" moments.- the main characters. alright, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life, but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies. thus, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation clichés. they are mere plot-devices, place-holders without the slightest bit of personality. they are "man and woman in break-up who still love each other". never seen that one before except in 100,000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable. think of the blandest two-dimensional hollywood fare and you've got it. there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh, charming, or interesting.- the far-fetched, vague resolution that's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple, though the word "resolution" might be ill-fitting here, because the movie is a swampy mess that isn't going anywhere anyway. by the time you're through, though, you don't care anymore. the last third of the movie i just fast-forwarded, because it was just so unbearable to watch.okay, that's it. whatever redeeming features this movie has, it all gets buried under incompetence. don't watch this turd.

someone, some day, should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films; of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions, searches for secret passageways and crypts, trackings of monsters through air ducts, and so forth. offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout--"demon seed," "cube," the remake of "thirteen ghosts"--but it's at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt; it's all about the character and the affect of spaces, passages, and walls. so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central. the idea is this: an architect has built--actually, rebuilt--for himself a huge and rambling house; his wife has just left him, mainly because of his own self-centeredness, but also, it is intimated, because she can't get used to the place since he remodeled it. living in unaccustomed solitude (real this time, rather than virtual), he comes to suspect that somebody else--a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared--is living into the house with him; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him.this is a good start for a melodrama, whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these: after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success, the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches, trying in various ways to surprise, intercept, or ambush the intruder, maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure. meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn't foresee or doesn't remember. the movie would turn into a cat-and-mouse game, a hunt, a battle; and finally, in trying to trap the intruder, the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation, in some way he didn't expect. then he would be forced to think himself out of it--and maybe at the same time out of his own self-imposed isolation--and in a final twist would nail, and maybe even kill, the ****er.nothing like this happens in this movie; the house is just a house, the architect is just a guy, and his nemesis is of an unknown character, if he exists at all. here is what does happen in the movie: once the intruder is installed in the house--if he is--the architect begins hearing noises, but when he goes to investigate finds nothing. he calls the police, they think he's slightly nuts; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night, she thinks he's more nuts. at last, more or less accidentally, he runs into the intruder (doesn't get a good look, but figures, who else could it be?--not a hard question, in a story with, to that point, fewer than three principal characters), whereupon he locks the doors, lowers the grills on the windows, throws away the key (i don't know why he thought this necessary), and leaves his victim to starve. i missed why this was a given: the doors and walls are made of steel? in any event, the architect takes to sleeping in his car. and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further, something else must be devised to take its place. and this is it: the architect--are you ready?--moves into the house of the man who (presumably) moved into his, and lives there in the same way. how is this possible? it is not, but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so: the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him; and while sitting in his car, he throws the picture into the street; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin, their neighbor; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way.if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible, what ensues plunges right in. the architect takes up residence with martin's wheelchair-ridden wife, unbeknownst to her; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he's able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around. throughout this section the movie is clever in one way, making (or leaving it to the viewer to make) the point that his life with this stranger, who doesn't know he's there, is in essence the same life he lived with his wife, as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer. but at the same time, his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat-burglar entirely incredible. not to go into the series of twists at the end--including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door--this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair; two nice people who take murder in stride; and (before the story started) the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses.... to the final, long-anticipated twist, the movie adds another, to make it even more offensive, and then...ends.here is a story that depends on the development of two things--the idea of the stranger in the house, and the character of the man whose house it is--and fumbles both. the first fumble makes it boring; the second made me angry, as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path, and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one: martin the tunnel-builder and sneak-tenant. the story should be redone by someone, some day.

one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through, killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show, brain damage, and pulp fiction. designed primarily to offend, apparently, but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it.

not totally off the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "killer tongue" is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film. there is very little dialog, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete "pond scum". i wouldn't even call it strange, more like just "total nonsense". this movie is certain to disappoint, and you have been warned. there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish............................................................... merk

this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life. just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history, along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene. i think the transvestite poodles did it for me, or better yet, her talking tongue...or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat. decisions, decisions...

first of all let's start out by saying that robert englund doug bradley and melinda clark should be commended for having to be associated with this piece of drivel. i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me "son, i just watched the stupidest movie ever. i responded as saying "the killer tongue huh?" she was like how did you know that? that's how bad this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first freddy pinhead melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap. run away. far away. if you see it on the shelf at hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and walk away....and i still want my two hours back dang it

really bad movie. maybe the worst i've ever seen. alien invasion, a la the blob, without the acting. meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue. bad plot, bad fake tongue. absurd comedy worth missing. wash your hair or take out the trash.

impenetrable rubbish. this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the dialogue is ghastly, the horror effects are laughable. the only thing that kept me watching was the ever-splendid and totally underrated michael cule.

i hate this programme: not only is the very concept ludicrous, but it tries so hard to be feasible (something that was left out of similar "i confess" ending programmes like, muder: she wrote).sigh. why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court?come on: after x-amount of years of the cases being unsolved, why must every suspect, every episode *confess* (damn it!) to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved?i bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen: "aw, shucks, officer, you're a bright one - i guess if you've uncovered enough to convince yourself i did it, i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court. what can i say? it's a fair cop."absolute dog s**t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of i.q.

this program is really overrated. a detective like danny pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the "rubber gun squad" years ago. the whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. every vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another vietnam veteran. there has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. the only hispanic killer was a "race traitor" who killed another hispanic to frame a hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. what a bunch of propaganda. hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.what's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. no real-life da will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. the state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. the only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost da's careers.

when i first popped in happy birthday to me, i checked the timer to see how long the film was. i was amazed at the length. both animated and horror films share a common ground: attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes. anything more, and you'll lose the bulk of your audience.this 110 minutes, or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me. i'd like to say half of this movie could've been edited out, but i would be too generous to say that. go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could've been edited, even without being a film major.regardless of the overstayed visit, the movie was below mediocre. it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the "elite 10" is killing off the remaining friends. for the most part, they not only over-do it, but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say "it's this guy! no! it's this gal!" you'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie. and don't get me started on the acting.okay, that got me started. i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the prairie (later, research proved my suspicions correct) because all the way through this movie, she genuinely looked blind. strange, as an established actress, she should've been the best of the group, but turned out the worst. the rest of the staff, aside from ann (bregman) was pretty damn bad, too, but she, uh, took the cake.the movie begins with a group of ten friends, and one's immediately killed off. barely anyone thinks twice of this "dear" friend's disappearance, so they continue on their merry way. slowly, then more rapidly, there are revelations about virginia's (anderson), the main character, past and her psychologist, who's a tad bit more personal (and on call 24/7, apparently) than most shrinks. all the while, more and more deaths occur.what's funny is, just as the first "disappearance," the more "best buds" vanish, the less the rest care. sure, they give a few seconds of air time to say "wow, (that person) just wouldn't run off" etc, but then they're back to their sexual ways. and speaking of which, it's probably due to the horrid script, or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute 30, but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene. see: the creepy guy that kept a mouse/rat in his pocket  literally  and was the most obvious suspect. i'm giving the film too much credit (and time,) but how he became part of the "elite 10" i'll never know.but, i digress, there's a mystery here. why are these kids targets? why is virginia thinking she's killed someone, when it was never proved ('till the end) that any of them actually has been slaughtered? and why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be "six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see"? hell, even for 1981, most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the 13th films  coincidentally enough, friday the 13th part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of happy birthday to me. perhaps, they're speaking of when they filmed it months prior, but were late to the, well, party.when the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you'll have to rewind 3-4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives, and even then, put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim/killer's words. even if you get the first time, it's an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale. it's almost worth watching the whole movie again, but as a drinking game.this birthday gathering should be avoided. it's a horrible and illogical first draft script  please, please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role, it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it's 100% unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances.side note: when i was a kid, or say 10-11 years old, i loved horror films. (still do, oddly. definite guilty pleasures, but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass.) we got our first vcr, and i taped as many horror films off network (or, edited versions) tv. all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape, which scared me to death  and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was. even though i have seen other clips of this movie, i think this is the first full-length viewing i've had. thankfully, this awful movie didn't wound me as a child. i am older now, and i can take this trash. but never again.side note 2: that said, that crazy "happy birthday to me" song played in the end credits (and as a score throughout) still creeps me out tremendously. i guess, this movie (or last few minutes,) did have an influence on my childhood. shame on you, melissa sue anderson!

i read this thornton wilder play last year in eighth grade. i was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen. let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. the acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to god-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. as if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and i also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between george and emily, well, is non-existant. the actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. there is no music. it is in black and white, which would be ok but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. in any case i think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which i don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. the play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.

this is the version that even the author hated, because it's so schmaltzy. they gave it a 'happy ending' and changed a lot of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharine. the 'stage manager' is quite good, i believe he originated the role, but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40's that is really just posing. the one great feature- the music. this has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth seeking out in a record shop. overall i think the 1989 spalding grey/ eric stoltz/ penelope miller version is far superior.

welcome to our town, welcome to your town? as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america, this three act play is opened before us with the help of "the stage manager", a visual narrator if you like. after his initial introductions, we are lead into the homes of two particular families; the webb's and the gibb's.this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century, and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town. here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover's corners, new hampshire, even if there are, too, the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers, they, never get a look-in.once the daily lives of these families have been introduced; wives cooking, children home-working, fathers working, kids falling in love and the clean picket-fences painted white, the second act is started three years later, after young george (a young and unrecognisable william holden, then aged 22) and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry. blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching, too, a turning point in their own lives, from the nest they lived and now, into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step. the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding, it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent, here we see not life, not celebration but death, and it is in this predicament that the dead, as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past, are here to remind us, to tell us, that life, and every last minute, every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered.it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too, feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on, and by, middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order. this isn't just about "our" town, this is moral diction aimed at "our" souls and how america can better itself if its peoples', (excluding the poles, the irish, the native american and the freed ethnic minorities', and minorities' in general, plus the supporting backbone of the americana's who, still, have not had a fair part in this narrative), such as the middle classes, can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest, decent living. the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only.i was entertained, slightly, by this movie too, but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting, the musical score or how well, or not, it was made. this was the movies intention to exclude other groups, and to only include the likes of the webb's and the gibb's, in the future of the developing country of the usa, a good movie, but also a slightly biased in its stance, i thought.taken from the play by us' born thornton wilder (1897 - 1975) this pulitzer prize winning play, and six academy award nominated movie, was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes; life, love and death, the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness. our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness, like other towns, nothing too exciting ever happens here, if anything at all, this town only has the "right sort of people", you can still leave your back-door unlocked here, we are seeing the developing lives of these two families, but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves. our town may just have been "any town", just as long as you came from the right part of town that is.

just too many incidents of violence.the film goes from one scene to another, and in nearly every one violence erupts.now i am not one who is shocked by violence, and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing. but, please, not one after another. my reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "here we go again." there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence, but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely, and couldn't wait for the end.if this is the best the film makers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes or delivering mail.

mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made. there is no plot, just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits.the special effects look like they are from the '70's, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just plain awful.the only thing worse than the television show are the toys, just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids.there are far better shows for your kids to watch!try giving your kids something like nickelodean, those shows actually have some intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers.

i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all. the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time. there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers. this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world. from the notes, i can see that it's been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen, i can agree with their decision. avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.

come on, what is the deal with this show, power rangers anyways? i always felt that the show, which was originally brought over from japan in a better form, took what was great in japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever.the bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc, all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots, bulk and skull, to the "duhs", of the main cast, jason, trini, tommy, kimberly, billy and zack, i just want to say one thing: give me a break!saban brought this from japan, and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago.now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such.all i can say once again is give me a break!

okay, i seriously can't think of anything worse than the pr series. there are many bad things in life...traitors, liars, etc. but seriously, power rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list. can you think of anything more stupid than five-six teenagers (who don't even act like a normal teen) dancing around in identical suits with different colors so that you can tell them apart? fans, have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured? power rangers are for five-year old boys, and believe me, i never liked this show even when i was five.i guess you can say dino thunder is an exception. the teens actually act like teens, and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor, or no, a teacher. it's got teen-humor, though the fighting is lame, i don't hate dino thunder.many people say power rangers are crap, but i wouldn't. it would be an insult to crap. so face it, five year old boys, power rangers is rubbish.

nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure crap. i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then, and even as a child i didn't like it. even a 8-year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting, and how much the special-fx sucked even back then. when the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. i don't know about you, but i didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all, and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very cliché alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. you never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.there is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (beetleborgs is a good example). all it is is just a quick way to make some money though. i challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. my guess is that most 'fans' of power rangers will tell me that i "just don't get it" anyway, or something along that line. i really don't care though; this was crap back then and it still crap now.

15 years ago, power rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially that of the youth. when i was a 3-year-old kid living in the philippines, i would watch this show every friday on abs-cbn (channel 2 over there). when the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe to me when i watched it with my dad and 2 uncles. my grandparents even sent me a "balikbayan" box full of power rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the rangers). i even played the video games, and loved only one of them ("mmpr: fighting edition"), which was really sad. anyway, it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like "gundam") now that i'm 18, i'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now. to prove this, i took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set dvd collection with "mmpr: the movie" and "turbo: a power rangers movie" and watched both of them. i was like, "ugh. how awful. just another junk in the attic for me." for all of you people of my generation, this is not a show that you'd want to watch over and over again. i'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally is not a bad thing now, is it? instead of "power rangers", i'd recommend something like "mobile fighter g gundam" (highly recommended), "ninja senshi tobikage" (aka ninja robots), or even the original sentai shows that were the basis of "power rangers."

power rangers, the completely awful kid's show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with it's complete cheesiness, and awful settings.this show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences.the toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such.i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was.as such, it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made.

mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993, supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s. now as a fan of japanese action films and series, you would think i would get a kick out of this show.you could not be more wrong. what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers.mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot.now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie, yet, the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked.it was followed by two really bad, and i do mean, really bad movie knock offs, and the actors starring in this series, completely disappeared from the scene.if you must choose, try watching japan's zyuranger series instead.also, what's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys? it makes them all look feminine!

i remember this show being on the television when i was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs. it was called power rangers. i remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.i never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like the tick were playing on fox kids. most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. the footage is ridiculous at best. the colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts. all the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.the toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. and of course two of the worst movies ever made, and i do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on.power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising. as an adult, i don't look at it fondly, but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows, fashion and guys' earrings.

many people here say that this show is for kids only. hm, when i was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) i watched this show first. it was disgusting for me. i talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? this was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on tv or anything else) we said "uh, just like power rangers" and laughed. and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of mmpr. it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. i did not enjoy that viewing. but it dawned upon me: maybe i have not enough imagination? it may be. however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star.

the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united states.there is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show.this is simply the worst show ever made, with awful actors, dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous.the owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense.kids of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage.

power rangers, the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s, has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created.what exactly is the point of this show anyway, other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children? there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway.look at the costumes, which look like spandex gone bad.the mullet style hair, earrings, and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days.avoid this show at all costs!

not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip-off of 'misery'. however, the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me.i'm not someone easily shocked by what film-makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor.i think most people, when watching just the first ten minutes of 'hide and seek', will find themselves reaching for the remote.

... and i have seen some bad ones.i have nothing good to say about this movie. the acting is poor by jennifer tilly - as to be expected. daryl hannah does an ok job, but nothing close to being able to save this movie.the biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer resorted to the "stupid heroine trick" to create a contrived suspense. when all daryl hannah would have to do is hide, she runs out in front of her pursuer. the hospital scene is absurd. without exposing too much of what passes for a plot, i think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed. lame. very lame.save yourself some time and pick out another flick.

this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr. it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie "misery (1990)". i cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, i was relieved.this movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. and as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...so, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important.

i rented this by mistake. i thought, after a cursory examination of the box, that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story. instead, it's a "christian" story, and i suppose is fairly typical example. if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc., but i found it rather painful. i have to admit that i'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. it paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination were widespread, for instance). and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent wsj).overall, thought, i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing, and it's certainly wholesome...

the premise sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible. interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece (romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one. the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya?) and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming. it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc). i like to think that god is a little greater than that.

when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like the garden of allah. how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.the garden of allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. it then got two silent screen adaptions. the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world. he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer. i'm not sure what was in david o. selznick's mind in filming this story. someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title. the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret. the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves. the monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. most especially marlene dietrich. i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.

i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian. i am not. if you are looking for a christian movie, i recommend this film. if you are looking for a good general movie, i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere.i was annoyed by the characters, and their illogical behaviour. the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong. one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this. i find that offensive: are we to believe that "thou shalt not steal" came from jesus? i suppose he wrote the ten commandments? and stealing was acceptable before that? i rented the movie from netflix. i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments. oh well.

i attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. an interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. in addition, i am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. never before had i wished for a negative score to rate a movie. so, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. this comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. this was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. the film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the "time machine" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.

i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low-budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that. the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn't expect a fundamentalist christian film!the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being. our hero, who is a bible professor from the 1890s, eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - jesus is nowhere to be found. this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg-wells-style time machine. the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point, which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film. earlier (or perhaps immediately later, can't remember for certain), our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says. what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about, however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful.in any case, that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time. so, if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors, then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as i don't think there's any evidence (and none was offered) for the physics of time travel in the bible. so immediately there's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there, but never mind...after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future, the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases. it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year (as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself, a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date: it's just two thousand and... *honk*). some of the shock went on a little too long, though. for instance, the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van. he sticks his head out the window like a dog might, is scared by the headlights and the starting engine, etc. that seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic. in any case, that's easy to ignore. the rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote.unfortunately, our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder. eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful, but mostly was just more of the same. a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy (go figure) and investigate his name. they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is. the movie frames these guys as non-believer bad guys for being skeptical.just before the professor is to head back to his own time, he is confronted by those two men. in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away, he eventually breaks into an almost insane-like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he's a prophet so they should listen to him. just in time, he's whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he'd heard so much about.the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self-proclaimed (and most likely false) prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god-given knowledge (that was stated or even hinted at).as i understand it, revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying (and failing) to send a bible into the future. first 2080, then 2070, etc. as the scene fades out. clearly he's trying to determine the exact date of the end times - which he shouldn't be able to know! essentially, the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only, it means there couldn't ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know! the entire movie's premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it's own credibility in the end.

falsely accused, skirt-chasing chums john wayne (as john scott) and eddy chandler (as kansas charlie) change identities to become "alias smith and jones". mr. wayne becomes "john jones". mr. chandler's is supposed to be "rev. smith", but wayne calls him "dr. smith". at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis, pete duel, jonathan harris, or ben murphy; although, wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career wise. pretty blonde mary kornman (as anne), grown-up from her days in "our gang", is a lovely interest for wayne. she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne. if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s, this movie won't make you one.

one of the more 'literate' lone stars, with time spent on character development and interaction, dialog and acting business. the opening scene sets the stage (literally) for the personalities of the gambler, kansas charlie (eddy chandler), and his buddy, john scott (john wayne) the rodeo (say roh-day-oh) star, both of whom are slightly randy. the film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he'd been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent). and oh, of course, they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end.the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling mary's butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here. no yakima canutt. cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. no george hayes. tedious stooge-like bi-play between scott and charlie, with charlie swinging at scott, scott stomping on his foot and then punching him (repeated two more times!). the skilled paul fix is underused. eddy chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. the villain looks too old and fat. so does chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. mary kornman, of the twenties "our gang" (see 'mary, queen of tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with john wayne, but that's about it for this one. seeds of a better western lie buried here.p.s. the ultra-short colorized version, which looks good, moves along so fast, it's over if you blink more than once. thankfully though, the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut.

before i explain the "alias" comment let me say that "the desert trail" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges. in fact it features carmen laroux as semi- bad girl juanita, when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short "saved by the belle". in "the desert trail" john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard. like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is moe hitting curly. wayne's character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after wayne robs the box office). no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl. things get complicated at this point because the villain (al ferguson) and his sidekick larry fine (played by paul fix-who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's "the rifleman") see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. moe and curly get blamed. so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones. who do they meet first but their old friend larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest (senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie). larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman (now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's "our gang" shorts). kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them. even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad. the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. there is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing. one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away (to screen right) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid (which it does) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

john scott (john wayne) and partner kansas charlie (eddy chandler) are trail buddies who make their way to the rattlesnake gulch rodeo. scott is a pretty fair contestant, but finds that unless he's willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter, he'll have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. quite coincidentally, bandits pete (al ferguson) and jim (paul fix) decide they'd like the rest of the rodeo take; they shoot promoter farnsworth (henry hall), and make it look like scott and kansas charlie are the killers. wayne and chandler use a running gag in the film where they're about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities. each time chandler takes a wild swing, wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly.if you're very attentive, there's a neat lipton's tea ad in one of the scenes in which scott's love interest anne (mary kornman) appears.later on in the film, the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery. having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways, bad guy jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but pete shoots him down. while being patched up, jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister anne. in an unbelievable scene, anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff."the desert trail" is one of the blander john wayne westerns from lone star productions during this era. noticeably absent are george "gabby" hayes and yakima canutt, one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters. if you're a john wayne fan though, you'll have to see it once, but that will probably be enough.

this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time. for one, it has his old friend paul fix in it; fix, being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters. the plot, about mistaken identity, payroll robbery and murder, is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western, but wayne's strapping good looks, easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. plump, balding eddy chandler isn't quite believable as wayne's womanizing "partner", and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. on the other hand, wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman, the little "mary" of the early "little rascals" fame. she is a grown-up 20-year-old now, blonde and cute as a button. most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star/monogram "b's" were fairly bland and colorless, but mary is perky, cute and, yes, sexy. there's a scene in the general store, where she works, in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of "nerve tonic", which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. anyway, it's an interesting little "b", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time. the final gunfight isn't handled all that well, and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while, but all in all, it's worth a look, if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman.

this picture seemed way to slanted, it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq. it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can't help but wonder about it's legitimacy and bias. also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd. to me the subject matter seemed confused, it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light, as a) an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b) an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v.a. this is a legitimate argument, but felt off topic for me, almost like a movie in and of itself. i felt that "the war tapes" and "blood of my brother" were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint. f-

'dead letter office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. what's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. it's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.

this movie had a imdb rating of 8.1 so i expected much more from it. it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. but before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. the thing is, i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office. hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon.

you know all those letters to "father christmas" and "jesus" that are sent every year? well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. as bizarre settings go, it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is "dead letter office". having said that, this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one. if it was royal mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang, some female priest of the church of latter day i've-never-heard-of-you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company."dead letter office" (the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up) follows the story of alice (miranda otto) who grows up in a seriously divided home. writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another. so, logically, she gets a job at the d.l.o. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez (george del hoyo). slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the dead letters office to its knees?nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god-awful heather graham film "committed" while watching this. however, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that ain't difficult. for a start, this film is much more logical. true, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. it is also well acted. both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best. part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. the other part is that when you consider australia's draconian immigration policy (i.e. if you don't speak english, rack off!), such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. the other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.despite that, "dead letter office" is certainly something a little different. it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it. yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an australian film). there ain't any major laughs, there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth-shattering in its magnificence, it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time. it's the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there.

this movie offers nothing to anyone. it doesn't succeed on any level. the acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. complete garbage, i can't believe what a laughable movie this was. and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing nc-17 movie. the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens. pathetic.

okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not. before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it. i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time. so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought: the beginning started off fine for me. it seemed to be heading in a decent direction. got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point. then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on. there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that. it had about 3 of these pointless scenes, where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward. then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull. oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job. okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya's attention. thats where it got disturbing. i didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it. i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so...i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up. but if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised.

do not waste your time or your money on this movie. my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. it was. i can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public. it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself. i honestly feel emotionally scarred. it went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick. and really not a good one. i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him. almost. all in all, an awful movie that was definitely rated nc-17 for a reason. don't waste your money. and don't let your kids watch it.

if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. spoiler: rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant. instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. she in essence nullifies the judicial system. the film "the accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. what the "descent" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? is victim any better that the accuser? no!!!

this movie was disgusting. their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage. what is garbage? the misuse of peoples time, the misuse of energy, and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write. talia you are a sick demented loser. your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem. the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage. i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for. if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie. i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "no more support from me." how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho? i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene. i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is; congratulations you won his attention.

as i write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'king kong, 'the wicker man' and practically every film that ever starred michael caine. this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'dough for the do-do' proves. an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampett's surreal masterpiece 'porky in wackyland', 'dough for the do-do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng. freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampett's inspired insanity. inevitably, then, 'dough for the do-do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached. for cartoon fans like myself, its equivalent to a colorization of 'casablanca'.

"dutch schultz", aka arthur fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented. this movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character, because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology. not only that, it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate n.y. and his religious conversion. it is true that he was executed by luciano, lansky, et. al. but that's as far as it goes. the exploding plate scene which represents luciano carrying out the execution of bo weinberg in his own home, assisted by his own mother is rediculous. also, there is the scene in which dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to legs diamond. it just doesn't work. the character of mrs. fleggenheimer doesn't work either. this movie does not need a doting jewish mother for comic relief. the lame representation of legs diamond was humorous enough. i'm sure the man is turning in his grave. and, by the way, dutch did in fact personally kill people, but, he was not rambo or 007. the scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd. i don't know. maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just didn't get it.

this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles, itself brilliant, but not this. nowhere did i see mel brook's name on here and i can guess why, he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. my gawd, who would find this funny. sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny, well cause it's simply not funny. it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles. did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? flat out, they didn't care. it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out. i guess it's useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be.

i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddles, one of my all time favorites!! the tv pilot for black bart stunk. the plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddles and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take-offs of big movies, but this one would never have worked. considering that for so many years tv would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on tv with the "n" word thrown around. on the other hand, i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces!!! there were quite a few actors/actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years. i had to write down all the names and do a few searches. that was fun. i was arguing with my mother if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash. i won! :)

this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th annivesery dvd special edition "blazing saddles". imagine the movie without the satire, humor, or writing skills. but with all the trappings of a typical lame '70's sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was. what the hell was lou gossett jr. thinking when he signed onto this disaster?? this was possibly the worst thing he's been in (and yes i'm including the first "punisher" movie and "iron eagles 3". steve landesberg, i understand as he can't say no to crap.my grade: f

to review this movie, i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino's "pulp fiction" (1994) when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living. jules tells vincent that the "only thing she did worthwhile was pilot". vincent asks "what the hell is a pilot?" and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is: "well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. that show's called a 'pilot'. then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. some pilots get picked and become television programs. some don't, become nothing. she starred in one of the ones that became nothing." now to stretch on what jules was talking about, there are billions of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not...well, good. probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is "w*a*l*t*e*r", a spin-off to "m*a*s*h" with gary "radar" burghoff as the lead. hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes? hence, the show was never picked up. what many people don't know (or what they thought they knew) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide. some have made they're way past and got onto the air (the pilot for the animated series "american dad" comes to mind, as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later. however, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why."black bart", a supposed tie-in with the mel brooks comedy classic, "blazing saddles", is a stale and bland "sitcom" with little heart and no soul. "saddles" was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind "what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv?!?" i say "supposed", because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from bart, on in this mess of a tv show. mel brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line (in a related story, i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie "clerks." that kevin smith was no involved in....you see what happens?!?).set somewhere around the same time as the movie (or at all), the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately 'black' bart, who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr., obviously before his stint in "real" acting, whereas in this he is playing a "g-rated" richard pryor. most of the other characters are carbon (if not, really bad) copies of the characters in the movie: jim, the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan, a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun. lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich-type accent and personality. while that's pretty much the end in similarities, the lead "bad guy" in the story is fern malaga, played by noble willingham, who i assumed would've been hedley lamar if warner bros. secured the rights to the name (see trivia for "blazing saddles") and his son curley...i dunno, taggart i suppose? the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot. bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin. really, it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the "series" and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an "alright" show. i can't really call it a sitcom (and even if i wanted to) and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros. studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like "m*a*s*h" (complete with a bland and dull "laughing" that is identical to the series). the acting is so-so, but there's one part that always make me laugh, and that's when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue. ha! the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie (surprisingly, they use the word "n***er" numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode, rather touchy for it's time period and even for today) and it gets repetitive.if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss...surly interesting novelty item, watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots (it's on the collector's edition of "blazing saddles", god knows why). there, yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air.

watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. even when you thought, "that mackerel surely can't be coming around again," *slap* there it was. i'm not sure what they were thinking. this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered, "did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series?" not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well. and while "blazing saddles" made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness, these stereotypes were just downright offensive. there was no plot line, the ending was slapped on, and the jokes aren't. still, if you are a student of comedy, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.

i'm going to write about this movie and about "irreversible" (the (in)famous scene in it). so you are warned, if you haven't seen the movie yet. this are just my thoughts, why i think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended).acting wise, rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words). the villain guy is good, but loses his "evil" touch right before the end. if he really never changes, then why would he let a woman tie him up? he wouldn't, period. then we also have the bartender/2nd rape dude. actually i don't think you would need him. at least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.let's reprise the story. rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). this wasn't intentional, as rosario states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. rosario's character meets a guy, who is a sexual predator, in all the bad senses. but he makes an impression on her.rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. i beg to differ. because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. talking about her mother, here's another problem. after the first rape takes place, rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened. seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. if rosarios character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. there was so much potential here. also her female friend: we see her at the party, it's obvious there is something going on and "boom" she is gone.the first rape is almost unbearable to watch. but feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending (rape), which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer! after rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ...), but left in the open. no real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. it's apparent that he isn't a "nice" guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit. but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. we get the point that rosarios character isn't the same anymore, that she went "bad" and is able to hurt people. (too) many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. back to rapist #1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again (really?). as absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl (very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately) and his football career. well career is a stretch and he is bullied. this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too cliché to stay with you. so rapist #1 submits to rosarios character ... why exactly? because he promised her, it was her day? again, really? a guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. another possibility would have a drug in his drink.so rapist #1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, that's just crazy! but what comes next, is even crazier. first she talks to him, then she "shuts" him up and forces an object into him. this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. this isn't about what this guy deserves or not, it's just intense. and of course that was what they were aiming for. now after she is "done" the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist #1. if this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the "revenge". having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.this isn't supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable, it's a hard watch & it is art-house. but the 10 minute (i didn't count ) rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. which brings me to the biggest disappointment.irreversible comparison: "irreversible" had the rape scene, but the movie went on (even if it was back into time). rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. first, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. and secondly and most importantly, this is where the art-house movie should've come in. it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. but then again, she didn't actually physically do that much (see above) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...good intentions (talia and rosario had worked before), but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesn't work) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...

a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks' blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is!the laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!however, it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr. trying his best to impersonate cleavon little. his embarrassment shows through in every scene. he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese!truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse!

"black angel" is minor whodunit, with june vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. dan duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help vincent find the real culprit. peter lorre has one thankless role as a suspect. this film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never achieving anything special. it is pleasant enough but then, at some point, it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big "give me a break" reactions. that ending alone could have sank the film completely, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. vincent is a wimpy heroine and duryea was never very good at playing good guys. i love film noirs, but this one was a real disappointment.

dan duryea, a perfectly decent b-movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s, can't do much with this one: young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer; when he's sentenced to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband. after a dazzling opening shot, flick quickly settles into b-movie formula. it certainly looks good, but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast (including peter lorre and broderick crawford) is just a bit stiff. based on a cornell woolrich novel, and passable for a single viewing. ** from ****

it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes. apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny. his skull-like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake, but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow. not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch, but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing. not only that, but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap. so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester. whatever the cap was made of, it looked very new and artificial. jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits, but brett did not have to dress-up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part. frewer on the other hand is painful to watch. even in the full "holmes" outfit, he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes.frewer's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad "upper-crust" british accent is painful to see and listen to. to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement. after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum, he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait. when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone, the jack russell terrier. i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone. but sadly, there is no dog in this movie except for frewer. wishbone would have made this movie a lot better.not only does frewer's version of sherlock holmes never stop talking (in that awfully artificial british nasal accent), but he is much to friendly and kind. frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to, and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth. perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production, they are trying to make a children's version of sherlock holmes (wishbone was better at that, too) that was kindler and gentler. whatever the point of frewer's interpretation of sherlock holmes, it is flatter than a pancake, and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen (including the previous worst, by charlton heston).overall, the tone of this film is awful. it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder. all the suspects over-acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed. holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie. even on murder she wrote there is less exposition.this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo. the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer. it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes, especially the bbc version with jeremy brett. this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie. the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help.the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity. walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer, and when he is often interviewing witnesses, his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible. unfortunately, the rest of the cast is amateurish, and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other (to show they are suspicious) is something that i had not seen in any modern movie.

as a casual listener of the rolling stones, i thought this might be interesting. not so, as this film is very 'of its age', in the 1960's. to me (someone born in the 1980's) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but i am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th '60's. i expected drugs galore with th stones, i was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. i have not seen any of the directors other films, but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. my only good opinion of this is that i didn't waste money on it, it came free with a sunday paper.

it utterly defeats me why godard is taken so seriously - and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. it's hard to credit that godard actually believed all that marxist and maoist kant. anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them. as a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? brilliant, jean-luc! as for godard insisting on making a film with the rolling stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. the bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. ironic that godard's one-time great friend, truffaut, with nuit americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and godard made the worst with le mepris! incidentally, godard didn't choose the stones' track of sympathy with the devil. it just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at barnes olympic studios.

this movie sucked plain and simple. okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped, and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. the rapist is a douche, but the girl victim is partly to blame. i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist getting raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.3.2/10

i mean really. this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind. okay, if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do, then maybe. i think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have, and this is not the vehicle for it. come on now, this film is just tacky.

at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue. this is absolutely not a girls film. any blokes who like it, are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from. dumb story, mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film. i've seen many, many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category. if you do happen to see it, the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending. so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.

the cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film. (hardly.)i find it interesting that the film's real title is trojan warrior. (trojan is a brand of condoms in the us) this movie is loaded with homoeroticism. if you like that stuff, then this film isn't that bad really. however, consider these points:there are numerous close-ups of actors' groins & butts, (one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants.) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime, peach, and red. from a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a drag queen! several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another, occasionally touching as they converse. also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? shall i go into the fight scenes? (yes, someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight.) the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. no fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you'd see in an old chuck norris flick. there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film.

well our standards have gone into the toilet. the direction was poor, the acting was mediocre and the writing was amateurish. and those are the good points. hopefully there won't be a sequel. otherwise, i might have to leave the country.

after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar ... i found myself constantly switching through tv-channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait.this movie is listed as being in a number of genres, and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them. 80% through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead. bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste.

rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. while its clear why dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, dawson seems out of place in the role. forgive me i simply couldn't find her. thats not a mistake, thats how i felt, i had no idea where she was. yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. i blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it), and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.what can i say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it's time i can't get back. for rosario dawson fans only, though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17. (and rosario- please, you're a better actress, pick better scripts)

revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film. having seen gaspar noe's irreversible (2002), i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus.*spoilers* the end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. however, the film doesn't even follow through with this. instead, the drawn out scene (which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or "this didn't fix anything" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background.my problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. i mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? do we rejoice in dawson's revenge? are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity? aside from this failing, the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance. character's are thin, dialog is monotonous, etc.normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't really seem to know what those were. thumbs down.

having just recently re-viewed "lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, i backed it with "descent" even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.it's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of "i spit on your grave," to the tawdry sensationalism of "lipstick," to the tasteful handling of the issue in "the accused." but "descent," though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. no, "descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn't that groundbreaking.i pretty much knew the plot going in. what i wanted to see *was* the "descent" or degeneration of dawson's character. being a big fan of rosario's, i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know, the kind of portrayal deniro brings to "taxi driver." unfortunately, the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition.the biggest point of failure is the second act. it became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a q&a on the dvd, but this excursion into dawson's character is never believably rendered. we don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time, what she's after, or why she's doing it. the poor quality of the audio/video again don't help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. by the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.one point of success that dawson does point out in the q&a is that by the end "revenge" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. while that's certainly valid, it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing.if you have the dvd, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really does show dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift's prissy, condescending dorm counselor. if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.as the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we've seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. so what?

i can't for the life of me remember why--i must have had a free ticket or something--but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released. i don't remember who i went with, which theater i was in, or even which city. all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film, and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over. unfortunately i stuck it out to end, which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far. my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says "look for problem child 2, coming soon!" that was hands-down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film.the plot, if i recall correctly, involved john ritter and perhaps his wife (lord, how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind) adopting a "problem child." maybe they think they can reform him, or something. i really don't know. if that was their intent, they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest, rudest, most horrid demon-spawn ever to hit the big screen. forget damian, forget rosemary's baby. this kid takes the cake. the only difference is, we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a "problem child." however, this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed. you want to kill him through the entire film, and when (spoiler, like anyone cares) john ritter decides to keep the vile hell-child you will be yelling "send him back!" in shocked disgust (like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did).this is only the second movie i have given a "1" to on the imdb. the other was superman iv, and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse. john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3, which he was not in, came out. he said something like "the only way i would do another [problem child] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform." amen to that!i would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again. 1/10, only because i can't give it a negative score, which is what it really deserves. someone burn the original negatives of this film, please!

problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade! this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. that junior can drive grandpa's car. he can scare people with a bear. he can put a room on fire! it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth. a sequel is an even worse fate. rent chicken run instead.*1/2 out of **** i give it.

"problem child" is one of the goofiest movies ever made. it's not the worst (though some people will disagree with me on that), but it's not the best either. it's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple (john ritter, amy yasbeck) who foolishly adopts him. this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film. it's asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout (i really don't know why). but i can't recommend this film. i know i'm being too kind to it. if there is one positive thing about "problem child" is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful. ** (out of four)

i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network. there's just something about the, well, sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on. yes, you're right about the sub-par acting, the plot which only an seven year old could like, etc. but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors. then again, a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel.

i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid, and there were parts of it (many in fact) that i did not understand. i think i have seen it once as an adult, and i then understood those parts. the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all. so what kind of movie is this? is it a "kids movie"? not hardly. it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids. is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? maybe, but then why wouldn't it focus more on john ritter's character instead of junior? when a film has a 7-year-old as its main character, in order to do well with it's audience, it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd, otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them). i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office, and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market.

the first scene in 'problem child' has a baby peeing into a nun's face. for this movie, that's witty. a nasty, mean-spirited 'comedy', it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief. john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. and what the hell's jack warden doing in this mess? slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience. but never mind all that. the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me, you will want to smack him right in the mouth.

this kid is rather bad, but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn. no, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems. a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not. through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is. even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one, and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too. the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart, they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion. add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort. not sure about this character, at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. not all that good, but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week.

my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was. after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself. it didn't.i can't understand the praise given to this film. the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time.one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (like in happiness). this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing. this film might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film, because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much.i generally like these types of small quirky films (the real blonde, walking and talking, lovely and amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time. completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.steer clear.

it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. the paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie. i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. newsflash to the the creators: i paid to watch you make a movie. i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. and rosario dawson? this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and i can see why. she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, a or b. i figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? wrong. she was listed as one of the producers. next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. if you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, i hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. as for the maya character, she didn't seem like a real person. anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made.

don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "fast food, fast women." it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing, horrific acting, and even bad music. i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen. she needs the fast food.spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting...like trimming your toenails. you'd have more entertainment value.the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie.viewer beware!

i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment. disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (sounds pervy, i'm not!) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's, i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. my conclusion: let's stick to the classics! yes, the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat, the actors unconvincing. even dawson is empty. some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us, that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. just like the scene where dawson gets raped: it seriously lacks intensity! i wasn't expecting anything 'irreversible'-style but still, aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her? i didn't. not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) and i read that the photography was impressive. well, it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either. i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie, i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again. lol. more seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american-canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks - fire walk with me'... the crude red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere... no, i just couldn't get into this movie. too bad.
