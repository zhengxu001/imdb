i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film. i managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead (which, by the way, is great fun).the story has massive holes in it. the plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at (looking daft and singing like a castrato). morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet. freeman and timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something, which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that; though freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion.don't watch this film, it is a pure waste of time.

the plot of 'edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire f.r.a.t. squad. whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, justin timberlake managed to ruin it. do not waste your time watching this film. don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice.and justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing.

*** review may contain some spoilers *** i'll make this review short and sweet. i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman. how bad could it be, right? well, it's pretty bad. justin timberlake plays pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison's police force. ll cool j is deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called f.r.a.t. (first response assault tactics). he's teamed with an "on-the-edge" bad cop named lazerov (dylan mcdermott). in the opening scene we see lazerov & deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs. i don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs. pollack, who works for ashford (morgan freeman) goes to a trial involving deeds & lazerov. he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly. wallace (kevin spacey) who is all within the f.r.a.t. team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey's performance are pretty lackluster. the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott. he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me. ll cool j is terrible in this film. he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. he was much better in movies like deep blue sea & any given sunday. the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film. the ending is far from satisfying.don't waste your time with this film. i'm putting it on ebay this weekend.

i rented this movie last week. i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. and it was, until justin timberlake came on scene. he is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. i mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors i've ever seen. he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack? i think matt damon would have been a better choice.kevin spacey was another big disappointment. his character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en. it might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.now, dylan mcdermott's acting is very good. it's about one of the very few good things about this movie. he is just inspired.morgan freeman is good but nothing special. he has some really cool lines though.about the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. i was expecting a big twist when lazerov (dylan mcdermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.

ll cool j. morgan freeman. dylan mcdermott. kevin spacey. john heard. cary elwes. roslyn sanchez. justin timberlake -- wait a minute. justin timberlake? and he's the star? i should have known better than to rent edison force. in fact, i did know better. but in a moment of absolute weakness, i rented this stv. when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. as in sat-on-a-shelf. which this did. and with good reason. the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force, and "journalist" timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them. he is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe i should say for his horrible acting. i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. just awful. the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a hobo. you just know the director was not in control. freeman is clearly slumming.

how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up? with enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop.you will never get your 90ish minutes back. life is too precious to rent this movie.i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.if you like justin timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. he does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him. however, i believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this movie.

if you watched this movie you know why i said "jesus, jesus, jesus". hehehe!!! every time they said "jesus, jesus, jesus"... i laughed thinking "jesus, jesus, jesus, why did i rent this movie"? i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen. wtf is timberlake? dreaful acting! i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job! this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him... but i really prefer an actor, not this android called timberlake. and his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. i was happy when they both were popped in the street.the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well. the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all. it would have been much enjoyable without him.by the way, the music was ok, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. something misplaced for this cops movie i thought. maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake.

timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen. it wasn't all bad, i just think the reporters role was wrong for him.ll cool j played the typical rapper role, toughest,baddest guy around. i don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend.morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie. he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie.kevin spacey wasn't good or bad he was just "there".overall it's a dull movie. bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.

pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-tv movie. i can't believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick. for some reason morgan freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying "pussy" when referring to nsync boy's girlfriend. morgan freeman calling women "pussy" is just awkward... what the hell were the people behind this film thinking? too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.i rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked.

the movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one. i have to admit i had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed. the voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off of legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them. said to say, i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only. too bad i was wrong. these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason i give this a 4. i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast... and cannot believe it.

oh dear god. this was horrible. there is bad, then there was this. this movie makes no sense at all. it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all. the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman. the fact that 'edison' isn't a real city, takes away. since i live in vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. why didn't they make it a real city? the only writing that was decent was'tilman' in which john heard did a fantastic job. he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. too bad. hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give john heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the a list.

there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video: it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud. the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring. just a notch above lowbrow (thanks to freeman and spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as justin timberlake's acting. i hate to knock the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better.the movie isn't all bad...just mostly. i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man. he deserves it. and, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well (you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery), and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars (out of ten...he's not that good).when all is said and done, the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake. it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters. all in all, t's just plain boring. that being said, rent this when you are suffering from insomnia.

honestly before i watched this movie, i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace. i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie, and watched it by my own. apparently they were right. i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did i watch this movie.of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business. but morgan and kevin? i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison. to be honest, their roles are rather stupid.well you might think if the players suck, then i should pay more attention to the story. it is indeed story is the core of a movie, but guys... trust me... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story. imagine this, a smart-ass journalist (justin timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss (morgan freeman). this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice (ll cool j) and an brilliant investigator (kevin spacey). at the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story.jeez, i could not even carry on with this. just recalling the movie is making me sick already. my advise guys, don't watch this! please save your money and time for another movie.

people, please don't bother to watch this movie! this movie is bad! it's totally waste of time. i don't see any point here. it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again.

lets enter the world of this movie for a second, so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here.edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50,000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars, shouting at them, and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him......instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief....instead of just walking up and pop!.....what do you do? the bad guy.....he talks to him. he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun. they have nothing to talk about! shoot him! shoot him now! but he talks to him anyway. oh another thing. at the end, a newspaper says "pulitzer prize winner story right here" or something right above on a front page of a paper, when its like the first time the story is printed. so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast? yea, you know those types of stupid movies? yea well that's edison in a nutshell.you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely, ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie,while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places,and who's last line "duck" was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made... and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks, little cocky bastard.the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best "denzel from training day" impression, which was pretty entertaining.oh yea so whats the movie about? eh, something about scandals involving the city edison's fictional special unit police force called "f.r.a.t. (i swear i'm not making this stuff up) which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s.w.a.t. anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from frat, and he goes scurrying off looking for a story, gaining his boss' (freeman) trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought. blah blah blah. its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day.the pacing was slow and off, the script was horrible, and the acting was extremely uninspired. it jumped everywhere without going anywhere. people get put in comas and you forget about them. everyone in this movie just didn't think. damn what a stupid movie. its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended...no lie basically, do not waste your time!

the movie started off strong, ll cool j (deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner sgt. lazerov (dylan mcdermott from the practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. the other big names (freeman, spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake (pollack) is introduced. given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake, i would choose the former. even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. i would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. everything he did in this film was unconvincing.just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. even hardcore n'sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.that aside there are a few plot holes, such as pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. this movie had so much promise. thoroughly disappointing.

beginning with the poster (featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey), the entire movie was a fraud. one stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - or nothing new, at least. after 10-15 minutes, you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop-flick.basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some city, all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town, under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. the almighty and above-the-law organization is called frat and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. frat cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. one hour later, after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system. bah! don't see this waste of film roll. freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether!

now i'll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie.that about sums it up too. i disliked this movie. to be more specific, i disliked the concept of this movie. the cinematography was good. the mood was nice. and the acting was satisfactory. however, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading. it is also offensive.i am a quarter cree indian, and for some reason i feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of whitaker's character. first of all, he's a black guy. and this isn't a racist remark, i swear. the thought of a white, hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents. the katana represents the soul of a samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a katana anyway? it must be one of those replicas, which insults the samurai caste even more.also, ghost dog showed no honor. near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain. not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates none-the-less.then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie. you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable? he kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to: bushido.so, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushi(samurai) holds dear. 2.5/10 bleah

"don't bother to watch this film" would be better advice, if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles. this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast, not just marilyn.the story was just nothing, certainly nothing like described on the vhs box, of course. there simply was no suspense, precious little excitement and too many dull spots, most of them trying to show why "nellie" (monroe) was so messed up. this was not a good role for monroe, even though i didn't need to see this character to know she could act. "some like it hot" alone was good enough evidence for me. but this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films.it's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark, anne bancroft, elisha cook jr., jeanne cagney, donna cocoran and others. summary: it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.

this is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose, then sets about "taming" his reluctant bride. it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time. we never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband. or why the members of her team are so eager to get a "real man" in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own. this only made sense in fifties hollywood.there's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip--the second time--then yanks her off her horse. never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye, which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip! then, he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp. that's some second wind. later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians (as they all are in these flicks) after they reject her now she's his "squaw". never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she's been negotiating with them for years. and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him--yeah, right. like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles. madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky. fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot, but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy. the only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end. the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls. even if you do see them as dolls, the total lack of suspense will bore you.total waste of time. even the scenery's kinda dull. give this one a big miss.

to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it, but i'm never one to let others influence my viewings, in fact i'm more likely to watch something out of defiance!. bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway, the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away. the picture isn't very good, and is in fact very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture. sadly it doesn't, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film, nobody in the cast come out with any credit, with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme.not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10

i'm basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night (9/27/06). i don't think i'll be watching again. the acting was totally wooden, the plot completely predictable, the ending totally unrealistic -- i mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? the lead actor (victor garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was!! i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor, but they can surely find better writers. maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china!! i'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season!

ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected! he did a fabulous job acting as a "renegade" cop within a "renegade" department. from the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in. he acts as a sort of "gentle giant" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. he was quite clearly the best character in the movie.this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards. after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down. his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. there are so many ways his character (moses ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. that he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. i was hoping to see more from him in this film.timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. this movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past. being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot-out.what irked me most was the way timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. he starts out having guns and not using them. then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo?! little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie. personally, it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic. make me believe that the story is true. this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied.

happened upon a copy of this. not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back! all i can say is this would be a terrible student film. any understanding of the medium of film is absent. acting is god awful, the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable.i can only agree that the 'glowing' reviews of this film are from friends and family. i'm afraid it's not even entertainingly bad.amateur in the extreme! avoid! avoid! avoid!

frankly i'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering. have they all been written by his pals? the action clunks along, the music is irritating and over used, the script is simply dire and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) mediocre at best. i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i.e. continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. yes, it's his first film, low budget etc. - i get it, but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch.

it's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any speeches. there's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. and finally last but not least the acting is appalling. for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this.

when thinking about captivity many words come to mind. among them are: uninteresting, unentertaining, unsuspensful, unsexy, unfathomable, and unwatchable.i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics. they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing, but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore and hip.this movie is a load of boring crap! what the hell has happened to larry cohen? his name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! even so, i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad! was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? did anyone not know it when they first saw him? only someone who has never before in his or her life, ever seen another movie!

i'll keep this short; thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly: captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink, imprisons and tortures her, then poses as a captive to have sex with her. that is the single twist and punchline of the film. it's torture as slow motion date rape. and, it's not even a good movie. it's not so bad it's good; it's just bad.it should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile. why no one had the cojones to step up and say, "this is garbage, and this is why," is beyond me.don't give your money to these poop-peddlers.

the only reason i give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on.this film is asinine. it's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder. the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting. i didn't care about any of the characters, but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap: i'd complain about the money i spent, but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining "live free or die hard," which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of "captivity" for 40 minutes.

absolutely fantastic. now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. much as i enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen). the two leads (daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne & celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence. the plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. what plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. for my part i came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.p.s. i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free...so i can afford to laugh about it. i was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was that bad.

the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor, a holocaust survivor, part of mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. the movie obviously had great reviews. it's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.i too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. "in one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center, the meaning of the word "forgive" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own" but by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more. after the "strong-willed" eva kor forgives her "nazi captors" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of kor. the movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory. to me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her "act of forgiveness". obviously, it was a very sick cow.on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the "promised land" to meet with some arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis, including one at a jewish center in chicago. from then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers. her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was. a rather annoyed dr sami advan (professor of education at bethlehem university) gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.finally, the debate at the jewish center in chicago, where she is "grilled" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.i will cut to the chase. by the end of the movie, i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie. the movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears. it showed that kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion. her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? quoting another imdb user, "i don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go." that would be the perfect layman's definition of making peace.i guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have "gone through more than the human mind can fathom".p.s. the dictionary certainly should go into all those books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making.

this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to it's expectations. the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the asian directors), but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle. basically, the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases. the acting was very good, however. all the actors gave good performances, and jude law was outstanding as he is always is. it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film.

jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. one decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. and a one-note plot.the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law's character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by timothy spall. but despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality.with a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of oliver curtis's cinematography -- crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.

i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good, right? how wrong i was. i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever. there is nothing new with edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. some examples of just bad silly moments in edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head...this movie is the opposite of good.stay away from edison!

i love all types of films, especially horror. that being said, survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it.i can't give it any points on originality. there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remaking what others have done. it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods, a crazed killer, and as of lately, throw in some crazy family. on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw, wrong turn (though the twist in that one is obvious), and others. survival falls up way short against comparable films. the plot was just not original in any way. some films can get by with a weak (and way over-done) plot with superb acting, special fx, or a slew of other factors. survivial doesn't have any of that to bank on. if you will, note the following: the acting in the movie never took off. i don't knock or blame the actors for that, nor the director. the dialogue was at best mediocre, and the actors involved never showed (not saying didn't have) the talent to pull it off. i mention 2 standouts. the leading man in this film certainly has the look, but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film. the actor who portrayed greg also had potential, but we never got to see any of it (watch the movie to see why, you won't believe it..).the grainy film look. ah yes, that little tid-bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of "grindhouse" films. in today's film making, that has become a gimmick. it either works or it doesn't. in this case it just does not work. there are too many other flaws going on, so it winds up distracting from the film, not adding to it. that being said, i think they did a good job of adding that grain. that is some good, quality grain. i think with a different script, better direction, and possibly actors, they should try another "grindhouse" attempt. they will probably pull it off.as far as the tech aspects, in my opinion, they never quite gelled for me either. better care could have been taken with audio (sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and for being shot on dv, it was too soft for my taste.that is all i have to say about that.....

this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness.i don't even have the vocabulary to say how dire, turgid, boring, confusing, and just plain strange this effort is (hey what d'ya know i do....) set in a post-apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue - it was all so incomprehensible i couldn't make head or tail of any of it.seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me: it really is awful.and not in a its so bad it's good cult way.it is just awful, awful, awful, awful.honestly. if you still don't believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think. even gerbils on acid couldn't hope to understand this.avoid or even better destroy...

this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. well there's nothing wrong with that, except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age. it's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves. the movie has no plot. it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath. there are some funny scenes and comedic bits. but they don't redeem the flat monotony.the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that. anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation.i went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a tarrentino piece. well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy. it works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over. it's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie. it's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy. i can see where the story idea is intriguing. but, in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england. in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era. he plans to make a part 2. i guess he thinks he's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.at the opening in la, wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2. he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one, to which he replied, well yea, sure.

this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched. do not rent! the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie. it starts with some what of a plot, then fades fast to nothing. i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover. the actors were awful, the plot faded fast, filming left to much work to be done. not one good thing to say about this crap movie. if you rent this movie you will waste your money. i really enjoy national lampoon movies, but this was a waste of time. learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to direct. i feel i should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost.

i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j. fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 if i ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time i'd be fired on the spot! the organization to which i belong (les clefs d'or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. in short it does a disservice to our organization. i welcome any comments.

i expected alot from this movie. kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie. i can't even explain this movie. it had wooden acting, terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. but that was at the end! the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't. this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings. the whole movie is missleading and boring. one of lees worst.

that is the only question i am left with. why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast? why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters? why did it not make any sense at all? why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "hollywood" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling? why? i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released. i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey, who are oscar winners, that this never is released to the big screens in america.as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism, the whole story is just utterly laughable. i just...think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a cliché, and an awful one at that. just. no.

wow. i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had.his acting was painful to observe. the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be ok.watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'kermit the frog' act in a hollywood blockbuster, just didn't work at all.

normally, i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest.you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet... well, this movie was just terrible. it is nigh on impossible to "suspend disbelief"; i tried, really, i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn't let me. timberlake should stick to music, what a dreadful performance - no presence as an actor,no character. can't blame everything on justin: the movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing; its definitely an "f".after seeing this, i have to wonder what really motivates actors. i mean, surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part. did he not see how poor it was? what then could motivate him to take the part? money? of course, acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work. ll cool j is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script. meanwhile, the audience goes: "what the hell is going on here? you expect me to believe this crap?"in short, apart from justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing.

i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in "edison." i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in "patton," or nathan lane to play jesus. but that is almost beside the point.timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role. i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent, but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench. with his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like "the 25 cliché expressions for actors," he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist. it simply will not fly.however, timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure. director david j. burke puts him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also places him aside morgan freeman, kevin spacey, john heard, dylan mcdermott, cary elwes and (i'm surprised he was as good) ll cool j. i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake.there is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief. a pleasure, if you will. freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air.but enough of timberlake bashing - words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick. "edison" is a very, very run-of-the-mill corruption story. it's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous. i do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which i interpret as an homage to films like "serpico," or "donnie brasco," or maybe even "chinatown." don't get me wrong - "edison" is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.the script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing. yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between piper perabo (who is wasted here) and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode. it's your typical far-too-glib-for-reality, let's-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail) dialogue. this dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like "edison" wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds (read slow-motion).thinking about it, "edison" is a curiosity. it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work. in film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. directors must make tough choices. david j. burke missed the mark here. some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture. and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.

my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show. i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. but he goes on watching it none the less. that is his right as an american i guess. but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode. it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can't stand. i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college. my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed, but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors. and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along (get the pun, ha,ha. like spielberg did. it's like jesus before he became a man. or thats at least what i think that would feel like. any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of peter falk. i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo's investigation, as many later episodes would do.

i don't understand how "2 of us" receive such a high rating... i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense, followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble. however, i did like jared harris' performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours.

this movie is one long chiche after another. first of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot. the wigs and accents are terrible. they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons. john is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book. they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation "it was always just the two of us"! john would not have been mean to his fans like this either. like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday. an insulted john says something along the lines of "sure and while i croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin". that made me laugh for days. really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here. forget it.

up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan. however, the new season had absolutely ruined it.the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light.i am neither christian or muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend. not any more.just cancel it and be done with it. it's not worth watching any more.it might still be saved, but a lot of change would need to be made.bring back the old format.

who likes awful "comedy" shows like little mosque on the prairie? the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are: one, muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. i'd be curious who even writes for this show? do you think it's actually muslims, or hip, funny young people? no, i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960's.when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are, air farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for "comedy" little mosque on the prairie. it is supposed to be offencive and funny? only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.

unlike many, i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive. its execution, however, is another matter entirely. like so many b-minus movies, all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers. for most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor. or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers. with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a canadian one.) notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas. unfortunately, they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies. the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (why? are they so hard to find in saskatchewan?) did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors? as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the cbc's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.

i was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. and talk about hype, i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. all of the characters are one-dimensional. the acting is - well - mediocre (i'm being nice). it's the classic cbc recipe - one that always fails.if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. it's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show.canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis. so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any?

this show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. well at least corner gas was good at first, little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. who are the people who are watching this show anyway, i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas. hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show.

if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. lmotp really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess.beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing. and once the "zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao!!" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don't see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.

i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all. the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about! i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. but there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters. the "fresh of the boat" dad, who doesn't understand his daughter. the radical feminist muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor, i only see him getting better).it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed, and don't really care to watch another episode.i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again, she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does, too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities!

little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen. they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for cbc means 85 year old farmers in saskatchewan. the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can't believe it. the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded. very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as "controversial" well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes, royal canadian air farce and rick mercer's report.

this series just gets worse and worse. poorly written and just plain not funny! the premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about, and resorted to that patronizing, smug, "oh, silly you" style acting that comes with a no laugh script. they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, aren't we zany? isn't this funny? well, no, it's not actually. gum disease is less painful. no wonder, with the exception of corner gas, canadians generally avoid canadian tv. come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent. pull the plug on this amateurish mess.

once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode. last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter. how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists? ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses. but not 30 minutes. it's called beating a dead horse. even snl would know to give up after a commercial break.also, let's have a little conflict in these scripts. will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan? when will ramadan start? ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here. and the characters! what characters?! they are all cardboard cut-outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next. that's the point of the situation comedy. we need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week. we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week. if i never see these characters it'll be too soon. thankfully i can't remember any of their names (note to cbc - that's not a good sign).and the acting is so bland. it's more so a problem in casting than in the actors. none of these people actually embody the characters they play. they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week. sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character the portray. watch any american sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying. that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows. but to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture. as another commenter mentions, this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom.and the directing or lack there of! what can i say, canada has so much talent, look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up. look at the trailer park boys (not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog). look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work.give credit to the cbc, they really know how to build publicity for a non-event. remember "the one"? no - well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show, as it's sure to go the way of the dodo.let's all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while.

at the beginning of the film, you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. it's not "memoirs of a geisha" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery. he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). cut to present day, when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. from then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. let's start with the good aspects, namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench (well, together with britt eckland, linda hayden and ingrid pitt). the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter. the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! in this "possessed" state, she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. so, strictly spoken, it's not really "evil" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in "ghostbusters". "the house where evil dwells" is probably the least scary ghost movie ever. throughout most of the running time, you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films "motel hell" and "from beyond the grave") intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top, like "motel hell" maybe. but then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. "the house where evil dwells" is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights. well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter's bedroom. how totally random and irrelevant was that? if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba.

this could have been interesting  a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to! besides, it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as, generally, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as susan george seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! at one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, he's called upon to exorcise the premises. however, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure, possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! at the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.

giant crabs cursing in japanese? what was in that drink? a terrible movie, but laughable. i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around. drink much beer before you see this movie.

from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but i didn't think it was that bad. i've seen much worse, actually."the house where evil dwells" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, ted and laura fletcher, and their daughter, amy, who move into an old house in japan. little do they know, a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. as strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. it was routine, and it was corny, but i've seen worse in my day. the ghost sequences were a little over-done, we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. to be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland. i may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the japanese horror film "ju-on: the grudge" and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little. the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc. but i may be wrong.to sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot. 4/10.

director kevin connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead doug mcclure, re-team in this ghost story set in japan. they had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'the land that time forgot' (1975), 'at the earth's core' (1976) etc. without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way.the film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide. a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted & laura, visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.no surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex (mcclure) assuming the role of the wife's lover.everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion. main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'the omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky susan george. the first is a long 'don't look now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter (probably at her insistence) entanglement with mcclure, both looking pretty uncomfortable. anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost.overall i can't decide whether 'the house where evil dwells' is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way. if you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.best scene - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup. on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line "ugh - there's an awful face in my soup". if this wasn't enough the reply is "c'mon, eat your soup for daddy." laurel & hardy rest in piece.

i just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about. so here's what my reactions to it are. it's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film. however, the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all. it just bored me. this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes. all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below.************contains spoiler************ i find the rape scenes quite tame. i don't know if i have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version. i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot. here's a list on top of my mind.why don't the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are. that would be an excellent time.why don't they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer's ordeal by such a long time. it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house. maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job.why didn't jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind, especially for someone who is a writer. why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive?i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him. ************************ends spoiler************but hey, this movie is not without its merits, camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer, `why me? why me, i didn't even c^m!!!'

i've seen the gator bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge.this is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but i was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a t&a film.b-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. on the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. these men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the gator bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.(spoilers) you know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. the woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. but hey, what more did you expect?oh, and did you read the tagline? if you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned. i was really looking forward to those

i'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. i've seen several reviewers call isoyg an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.first of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? that's right: a shapely woman's behind. whether it was zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and i absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.the rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. there's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb (caligula, cannibal ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.finally, a few reviewers have commended zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. but considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing.i'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg. i'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. in fact, i'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. however, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll.this is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but i'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.

okay, you have:penelope keith as miss herringbone-tweed, b.b.e. (backbone of england.) she's killed off in the first scene - that's right, folks; this show has no backbone!peter o'toole as ol' colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor.joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. it's alright, they have col. cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for christmas!) still, she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)david mccallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the circus.and finally:susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups, venerable headmistress of the venerable girls' boarding-school, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. her best bit of advice: "i've only been to nancherrow (the local stately home of england) once. i thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world." well, we can't say they didn't warn us.ah, susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. they don't write 'em like that any more. our loss, not yours.so - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of "brideshead revisited," right?wrong! they took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. after all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (you name another!)first warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. they get around it by shooting outdoors - "hey, it's just the sunlight!"second warning sign: leading lady cries a lot. when not crying, her eyes are moist. that's the law of romance novels: leading lady is "dewy-eyed."henceforth, leading lady shall be known as l.l.third warning sign: l.l. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. still, i'll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (i wonder . did they use contacts?)and lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is "mrs." she's either "miss" or "lady."when all was said and done, i still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. i couldn't even tell you what was said and done.to sum up: they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all.ok, at the end, l.l. finds she's lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. meanwhile (there's always a "meanwhile,") some young guy l.l. had a crush on (when, i don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor (must be some street if she's going to find him there.) both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow (somebody has to be "whisked away" somewhere in these romance stories!)great drama.

with knightly and o'tool as the leads, this film had good possibilities, and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly, maybe some tension. but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. it was of course totally superficial, beautiful english country and seaside or not.the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.

quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.a group of top quality actors, in the main well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions), who give pretty good performances. penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana. all do well with the scripts they were given.so much for the good. the average would include the sets. nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it. it is clear then that the dower house is far too big. in the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon.now to the bad. the screenplay. this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives, blinded. he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why?? loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than brief encounter). gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint. walter (mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak. aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification. the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers. whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful, i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward. the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson. the word limit prevents me from continuing the list.there is a sequel (which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense) and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story. it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.

being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, i thought i was in for a treat when i took home "my wrongs..." (not that the dvd cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, chris morris, "a short film including scenes"). i should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.the scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series, brass eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand.the runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. this is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.the film does have its moments of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, i strongly recommend "franz kafka's it's a wonderful life", by peter capaldi.

simply not the quality i expected from morris (love brass eye and blue jam). this is very much like a not so bad student film. what concerns me, in all this is why did it win a bafta??? morris makes fun of 'enshrined mediocrity' (ayn rand) in much of his work (nathan barley) and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining! i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle (the humanity of terrorism - four lions) that he isn't going to cock that up, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena.

there's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. it's just that some are better than others. this is very poor. the acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.why does hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? and why have they made a sequel?

one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked. one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning, i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner. if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home, i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies.

enough is enough...sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead. the first tremors movie was great. the second one was ridiculous. the third one was nauseating. the tv series was depressingly awful. and this movie just drives the stake deeper.basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have the series set in the wild west, in the 1800's, and they fight graboids. like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again. mildly entertaining i suppose. otherwise this straight-to-video release, just like tremors 2 and 3, is just going way too far. oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place...did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event? i think something like this would be history-making, so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared. movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy. avoid this garbage.

dear dear dear dear dear...me! i had the strength to see it through... but why?!the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. this was some kind of tremors for kids. i can't believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it.what audience is this movie for? i can only think of 12-14 year olds. if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie. it's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. the characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. you know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids. i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. it's so bad..so wrong..so...crap.but ok, we did get a laugh now and then. not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. still makes me grin when i think about it. but that only happened one more time sadly..and that's when the "badass" gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment "they spring from the ground like some demonic trout!" at this point we where almost crying with laughter. but after that..nothing could ever top that..(?)..so it's pretty much downhill from there. so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting. if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he's either a "plant", vegetable or someone very evil. this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far. looking forward to seeing tremors 3, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...*goosebumps* no..i'll leave it at that.

well...tremors i, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii. trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one, i mean, ass blasters??? now, only god himself is capable of answering the question "why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?" tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. as i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest buying this movie, i mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.

just a few words.... this movie really sucks. it's like those tv movies with bad cast and plot. it's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii. don't waste your time watching this crap, even if you like the tremors movies.

this, the direct-to-video death rattle of the tremors series, features sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at. tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget. that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, tops. the lackluster, cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long. only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through, much less enjoy this film. if you aren't among them- don't bother.

the fourth "tremors" feature goes back in time, to the year 1889. "the legend begins" in the small city of "perfection", which was then "rejection, nevada". as the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly "graboids". some of the characters in the present-day "tremors" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. most obvious is the ever-returning michael gross (as hiram gummer). unlike his descendant, mr. gross is inept with firearms; so, he hires gunslinger billy drago (as "black hand" kelly) to shoot 'em up some "dirt dragons".this one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past. it's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster "graboids". these tamer "dirt dragons" are nowhere near as terrorizing as their "tremors" (1990) counterparts. consequently, in this film, the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. and, it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when gross temporarily decides to leave town. why so helpless? why didn't brent roam (as juan pedilla) immediately rally the people to fight without gross? disappointing.**** tremors 4: the legend begins (2004) s.s. wilson ~ michael gross, brent roam, billy drago

warning: this review contains minor spoilers.well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas. i'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare. tremors 4: the legends begins, however, is a very dull movie. where the heck are the graboids??? due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes i'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a "character study". unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago's character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time. what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer. whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch. however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute. on the plus side when the graboids (dirt dragons in this movie) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long. pretty good for straight to video. but after watching it i'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any. was there a rush to get this movie made? i think not, more time could have and should have been spent on the script.i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale with....tremors!!! what luck i thought, pay for #4 get #1 for free. well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free, i can't imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4. for fans of the series it's best to forget that tremors 4: the legend begins even exists.tremors 4: the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10.

i found tremors 4:the legend begins, to be dull and boring.all the action scenes were stupid.the so called "graboids" are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat, if not smaller.the acting was horrendous, and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so dumb and useless.also, if you want to tell a story way back in time, make sure you use the same actor(michael gross), to be someone in the past, when he's someone in the present in the other tremor movies.geez...if you haven't seen this film, don't waste your time.stick to tremors, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time.this film however, make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.

if fassbinder has made a worse film, i sure don't want to see it! anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this, to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like "the bitter tears of petra von kant". this film bogs down with so much arty, quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of an "art-film". the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira's prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance. but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter. these are the only moments that display any real human emotion, and prove that at the core of this horrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to free itself. what a waste.

as if the storyline wasn't depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher. weird stuff. then there's the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly. he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did, but it's really really so hard to empathize. such sad and unusual self destruction. was it supposed to be funny? what was it all about really?

this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. that is no exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin/elvira suicides at the end, but instead of this, in every scene somebody is trying to explain: "when he was young, this happened..." and "he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there...", etc.soon in the movie, erwin/elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute (certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while telling her the story of elvira's life, fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other. it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of "i have suffered much in my life, and am about to die".in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something, erwin/elvira encounters a former lover, that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes elvira.there are some interesting shots and ideas, i must admit (such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin), but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder's self- indulgence.

it's funny. i've seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film. for me, it ranges from great to crap--without much in the middle. i know he has a lot of fans among the "sophisticated", but i can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype. from my point of view (and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this), he made too many movies too quickly and was too self-indulgent. his gay or gender-bending films (like this one) tend to be really bad--sloppily done, sometimes quite boring (such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant) and sometimes just gross (like this film). couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender-confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered? show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic--then, maybe, i'd care about the films. i'm honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good.

this film is in the mandingo & drum typethey were both dreadful but they are 100% better than this tripe,badly acted & made oliver reed is the main name & eartha kitt also is in it. tis a pity. rating is 1/2* about as low as yu can getas alwaysjay harris

there are no reasons to watch this movie. should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill (like that would ever happen) then get this movie from the video shop (if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie. be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone (in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing). oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk - go figure. but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie - claudia udy showing her chest! sadly no other reason than that!

this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the "seinfeld" show! patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here. oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all. warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him. eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film. if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him. then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff. no real political message like the film "burn" but just another contrived plot device to move the story along. incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back! i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad. the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable. very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel.

2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.i thought with a cast of james woods, cathy bates, randy quaid, lou gossett, jr., and henry thomas - how could it miss. i was wrong.i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble. i'd long suspected sam s. of being kind of nuts, this film, based on his play, confirms it.this is the kind of artsy b.s. that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote. however, for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash, there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie.you haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch. pa is crazy, ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yeah, crazy. they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter.in addition to the above, as if that weren't enough, the plot--and it's so thin you could read thorough it--has a hole in it the size of alaska.ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm. as it turns out so is pa. now i don't claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time i checked, property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold. if only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. mr. shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore, his plot does not work.not that anything else was really working anyway.the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity, and i can't imagine why anyone would want to.

before seeing this movie, i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done. now it's everything-minus-one. james woods is pathetic...not his character, his acting. someone should've told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant, nor cliche. ditto for randy quaid's stereotyping. the only redeeming feature is henry thomas, who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess. if you enjoy the country, you'll enjoy the scenery. that's the best i can give it.i'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films, but this is simply terrible.

this would've been a *great* silent film. the acting really is good, at least in a look ma, i'm doing really big acting! sort of way.everything is huge. every line is profound! every scene is shattered by human tragedy!mostly, i felt like gagging. yet, like any train wreck, i couldn't tear my eyes away. this dialogue might've worked on the stage, although i doubt it. on the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.if you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. be prepared to wait, however. for all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.imdb does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled "weighted score". curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1.character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! your characters must have a motivation. being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. that's a plot contrivance.stay away from this movie. or at the very least, watch it muted. perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see james woods in all his dangly male "look-at-me, i'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man" glory.don't say you weren't warned.

this is not a children's movie!!!this movie is like a "bad acid trip" for kids under the age of 5. for a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me "why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth" or "why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?". (and that wasn't the worst of it). we stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done. intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing. whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges. ... (go ahead censure me, my conscience is clear.).

i caught this at a test screening. all i can say is: what...the...hell? this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for "scarface." it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense; and even if you do leave your brain in the car, the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny.the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to "save" a crocodile which contains a cia probe. the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back, irwin mistakes them for poachers, and sets out to "stop" them.that's about all the story there is; the rest is over-the-top lampooning of australian culture ("didja see dat?" and "crikey!") and strangely choreographed action sequences. at one point, irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it. yes, that's right: steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv. let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film.

ok, first of all, steve irwin, rest in peace. you were loved by many fans. now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. it was "the crocodile hunter" tv program with bad acting, bad scripts, and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals. he was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. millions will miss him. but the whole movie idea was a big mistake. the plot was so broken, it was almost non-existent. casting was horrible. the acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. the direction must be faulted as well. if you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you must not be that good in the first place. i could have written a better script. i wish i had never been to see this movie. of course, i watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me, $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action. my son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie alright, but he still has never asked to see it again. if you want fond memories of steve irwin, buy his series on dvd. avoid this movie like the plague. if i were steve, i know i wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. respect him: avoid this movie!

i never was an avid viewer of "crocodile hunter", but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about steve irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. this movie, with steve and his wife, terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but i didn't hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. well, now i have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a bit better. apparently, it's supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all.a u.s. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia, where it is swallowed by a crocodile! while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt, and are unaware of what's inside it, two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon! the agents are assisted by jo buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! on steve and terri's mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just the crocodile, and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it, when steve sees the cia agents after them, he mistakes them for poachers! not only did i not laugh once while watching this film, the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents. apart from that, i don't think i found anything even mildly amusing. it's also a bit of an incoherent mess, switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters, and it seems like clips from "crocodile hunter" and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as brozzie drewitt, played by magda szubanski, is supposed to be, she's not. at one point, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a major cliché in modern comedy! are they so hard to resist?! i also found the typical "crocodile hunter" scenes, with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers, to be tedious, but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn't help.steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. no matter which side you're on, "the crocodile hunter: collision course" is not a well crafted movie. i'm sure it does help if you're a big steve irwin fan, but even if you are, there's no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven't been impressed. in fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have, so maybe it won't help. like i said, there's no guarantee. i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. the attempt to combine what is usually seen in "crocodile hunter" with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!

some people say steve irwin's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act. watch this film: it's obvious he can't act.steve irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his *crocodile hunter diaries*, *croc files* and eponymous *crocodile hunter* series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?), rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with *crocodile hunter: collision course* (yup  there's a definite trend of words beginning with 'c') - basically an episode of *crocodile hunter* mashed together with a b-movie.on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (magda szubanski), steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies (lachy hulme and kenneth ransom), out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed. will it hurt my credibility to say "they're on a collision course with wackiness"? (what credibility? - ed note.)the plot is irrelevant, as it is steve's animal magnetism that propels the film. if you find his persona trying, the film is a failure, but if you're a fan of either him (as a businessman, conservationist or just plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget.john stainton, faithful liege, best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter *oeuvre* (can it be called that with a straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester.the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks) and terri (steve's spouse of 10 years, fiercest ally and closest friend) treat it like it is one of their documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and speaking directly to the camera, whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie (well). it wouldn't be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve's life, we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics, or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting, crisp audio and seven action angles. while terri is unfairly painted as steve's mildly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last, i'm not complaining), steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, well, to him they're not really stunts, just a day at the office. of course, watching this madman's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings. but to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *crocodile hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints so enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend. he died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that.(movie maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)

the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times.it may sound weak and cliché but it's true; you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin. it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure. for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren't good actors, not even when they play themselves! their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.the movie had quite some potential, i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was; brilliant! the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. the movie does has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still, i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.watching this movie felt like a waste of time. still this movie might be watchable just once, when it gets on tv, on a rainy afternoon. it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.4/10

i saw this film yesterday.. i rented the dvd from blockbuster.. in fact, i know one of the actresses from the film.. i won't say who..! (that's kept under wraps..) but i must admit, it wasn't as good as i thought it would be.. tom savini? hats down to this guy.. but it's a shame he wasn't in the film for long.. what lacks the film is the idea, the script, sound, etc.. it may look like a good movie.. but it wasn't that entertaining..well, i'm glad my sister paid £10 for renting 3 dvd's from blockbuster.. i chose this one.. and i was disappointed. anyway, thumbs down for me..! not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!

i couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it. it's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. the shots used are disgusting, they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time. my head hurts try to watch that load of "you know what". dirt on the "mystery machine" window make you see light from the lighting on the windows...annoying. what else... it's so badly framed all the time it's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there. i only directed short films, but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film.... the story is unbelievable, just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it's gonna be pretty awful. so pretty much, try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost, it'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental, and that 1h30 hour of your life you'll never get back...

if you liked "blair with" you'll like this one. it has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.it also has tom savini, so if you like romero's "dawn of the dead" or tarantino and rodriguez' "from dusk till dawn" you're in for a treat. he is an icon and a very good actor as well.no, seriously. this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time, and i've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well. i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but this was just a pure waste of time.the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth... no, i'm just kidding. i must have missed before i hit "submit" on the vote form.stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!

when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow.1)the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local. dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens. what, who, how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst. 2)the van will break down. 3)whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)they will find a house inhabited by a madman, he will capture them. 5) the house will have a phone but it will not work, it will be disturbingly decorated, there will be flickering neon light, spiders and maggots. 6)the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor). 7)the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap, weak scare and will then be killed properly. 8)only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9)there will be an unnecessary twist at the end. add to these elements naked sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens, throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie.i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film, darkhunters, which is one of the worst films i have ever seen. at times the cinematography is very good, the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies. i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity. however, the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again, but amongst the dvd extras.if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief. there is more to say about this than the film itself. one staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea. he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if "people will get it". i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough, acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work. if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; "what was the point?" this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies, any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked.the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats. they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use. however, the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary. there is a simple distinction to be made here; mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant.the best moment is reserved for robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film. those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that. i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule. the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers, complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born. as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting, they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant.the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast. robert's swears blind in voice over, 'i didn't want to make a film that was like baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. there is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is "the best british film in years". i don't know who he is trying to convince. at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly "i can see people sitting at home saying "this isn't amazing, its sh$t" he isn't wrong.

ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves. anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and tom savini! there is just no way this movie can fail! right? wrong!! it just seems like such a waste! there was really no story, the dialog was terrible (is anyone there? x 1000!!!), the characters were.. well, they really lacked any kind of personality... the effects were terrible.. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing.. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff? we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something... anything to happen... but no... "oh, here comes the nymphs! great! oh.. they're kissing... again... and now for the violence! ok... nothing really happens... again... oh, now they run around... and the closeups of eyes... again... oh, heres tom savini! oh... he died... right... ok, maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen.. no.. oh! cool! a severed head! the end... oh crap.." and finally, since i'm so full of myself.. i'll tell you this! give me a van, six actors, a weird looking house, tom savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen... i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this... what is this johannes guy doing?? making cool movies is easy!it could have been so great... i'm really upset!!

i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with "book of shadows", i was wrong. this film makes that look like "the magnficiant ambersons" compared to this piece of shameless, unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie. i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it, bobbins.and were these people english? and where is the forest> i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands. the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation. those angels looked like anorexic pornstars (turned most of them were, did my research). i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces.p.s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act

come on tina fey you can do better then this. as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end. sure it was funny at times. even laugh out loud funny. but there isn't enough laughs to save this movie. i don't recommend buying this. at the most i recommend renting it but thats all. baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for.tina fey and amy poalher made a good team. mean girls is one of my favorite movies. tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this. but this isn't there best. baby mama had a great supporting cast. dane cook, sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness.another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world. after the great knocked up and juno, baby mama looks very average when compared. knocked up and juno are hilarious, heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. baby mama's ending was unfunny and dull.baby mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be. i recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious. expect a average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional ending it tries to have. i give baby mama.....4/10

i wouldn't say this totally sucked, but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house. steve martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat. he's just not funny. he's another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie. the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original. amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately. the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes. the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant. the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts, but it seems to simple simmer along, not really entertaining or creating laughs.

i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless. an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man. they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or,duh, burn him. quentin alias mr. fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage. wow, love plot. the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid. the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film. where is the mummy? really just a curse unleashed. this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least.watch this movie if you need sleep, because you will dose off.

an expedition led by hunky captain storm (mark dana) travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. they meet beautiful mysterious simira (ziva rodann) who joins them. they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy...and only simira seems to know what's going on.a real snoozer. i caught this on late night tv when i was about 10. it put me to sleep! seeing it again all these years later i can see why. it's slow-moving, the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in (and this is only 66 minutes long!), the acting ranges from bad (dana) to real bad (george n. neise) and there's no violence or blood to be found. this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics (involving a silly love triangle) than horror.this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it straight, there's some good acting from diane brewster, it's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) aren't bad. they're not scary just mildly creepy. still, this movie is pretty bad. a sure fire cure for insomnia.

**spoilers*** slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population, who are at the time revolting against british rule, from finding out about it.given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors british capt. storm, mark dana, together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs. sylvia quentin, diane brewster, the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin, george n. neise, make their way to the unearthed mummy's tomb. on the way there capt. storm sylvia and his men run into this desert-like princess simira, ziva rodann.simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life, she doesn't drink water or get tired, but also knows just what capt. storm & co. are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig, pharaoh's ra ha tet tomb, as possible.at ra ha tet's burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of archeologist's together with his egyptin guide simira's brother numar, alvaro guillot,already opened his tomb before capt. storm can get there to stop them. quentin violated ra ha tet's body by having dr. farrady, guy prescott, cut his bandages. this action on robert's and dr. farrady's part has numar faint dead in his tracks. it later turns out that numar somehow was possessed by ra ha tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age, at the rate of 500 years per hour, to become himself a 3,000 year-old mummy.the movie has numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around ra ha tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive, like a vampire, of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with. this blood-sucking adventure by numar, with him later losing his right arm, goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance, you in fact thought that he already found it, to ra ha tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide.we learn at the end of the movie that numar, to absolutely no one's surprise, is actually ra ha tet reincarnated into another, some 3,000 years later, person or life. numar's sister the mysterious and sexy simira is not only ra ha tet's sister, since him and numar are really one and the same person, but also the egyptian cat goddess babesti! also not that hard to figure out.with numar/ra ha tet back in his tomb and all the deaths, due the the pharaoh's curse, now at an end capt. storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to cairo and modern, this in 1902, civilization. the survivors of pharaoh ra ha tet curse keep what they found, and unearthed, only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway.

the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. one by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig.to be as brief as possible, pharaoh's curse is quite the lackluster affair. while the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. to make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but pharaoh's curse tests even my patients. the cast helps very little. with only one exception (ziva rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay. finally, i don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it's a laughable, ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh's curse, i'm going to rate it a 4/10. not a good rating to be sure, but generous given all the problems i have with the movie.

this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad... hence, can i advice anyone to watch it? well, i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition (i still can't believe it won)..and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q&a section..but that was also anything but interesting.. what's it about? well the first half (the worth watching one) presents three characters: a hooker, a musician and some kind of official..the first two lie about their professions..but the third is the actual liar.. the second half (do something else..don't ruin a good evening) includes some old breasts and heavy drinking.. but maybe you will see it completely different...the tiff jury did (were they drinking vodka ?)

as much as i dislike saying 'me too' in response to other comments - it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90.having been banned somewhere doesn't make a film watchable. just because it doesn't resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible.worse yet, in addition to no discernible plot (other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people, even very old women, drink lots of vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i'm in to my second package of rolaids.as for spoilers - well, the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn't write one if i tried.don't waste your time or money, and don't confuse this with good russian cinema.

i agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and get's you wandering about what is to come....... which is nothing. all open story lines remain open; two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture, save for 1 or 2 very short scenes. i wander if ilya wouldn't have done better to just completely leave them out.... as for the one remaining character, nothing is done with her either. she just visits some god-awful place, and suddenly the movie isn't about her anymore, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread, drinking homemade vodka, and apparently flashing each other. some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling, like the judges of the iffr, but for me it is just bad taste, bad camera-work, a lousy script and frightfully bad direction. therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading: 1!

the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good, funny story is to come. well, i can tell you it will not come. it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness. in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience. i was amazed to hear that. am i living in the same world he lives in? ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all, but that doesn't make me feel like i am losing my identity. what does khrzhanosvky think, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? am i shortsighted or is he?well my vote: the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.

the worst movie i have seen in quite a while. interesting first half with some engaging, terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late-night bar. the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock (read disgust) without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else.i wanted to walk out, but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect. still, time is precious (as the director himself observed in his intro) and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one.saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female lead.

let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more (most!)open-minded movie-viewers...movies are my passion, and i am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-place...i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there, and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult-movie-area...i love to rent strange stuff, and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult-movie-video-place.he told me he thought i had to see this, and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky(one of my favorites!)atmosphere, i rented it.the vote i gave here is not really fair, because i did not think it was awful, i just did not know how to rate it otherwise. a question mark would have been more appropriate...this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach: i actually felt physically ill! am i the only one whose stomach literally turned? still i did not want to turn it off, or maybe i just couldn't because i was fascinated in a nasty way...i do not ever wanna see this movie again.not awful,a 1 as i said.just not my cup of tea(or wodka for that matter)...

film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar. ok. they're talking about their imaginary lives, lying all the time, with no reason. still ok.from time to time, they even make you laugh. interesting. first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it! but then...things become worse...nothing's happening...for a long time...and then, when something happen, all you can see are naked old "ladies" touching each other! not ok. disgusting! by the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but it's everything except that! movie has no point,it's boring, and sick! the strangest thing is that here(belgrade, serbia) on fest (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to researches, of course, before people watched it! i even thought(before watching): "hay, this might be interesting, although it's a russian movie"! but, god, no!!!!

the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend. there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. the core of the movie is the funeral, wake, and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. apparently, the movie is unedited. the prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud. maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape. the village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl. continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones. don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in russian.

the russian movie, "4," follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar. one is a musician, one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl."4," i gather, is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-soviet russia (the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are), but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it. there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here.despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes, "4" is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.

i'm starting to think that there's a conspiracy, all right: one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film, despite its obscurity, will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a "universal acclaim" or something within that range, thus ensuring unsuspecting folk (like me) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing, expecting a surprise, only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck.this movie is one of them. it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it's rather clear that two things might have happened: either i didn't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film's inner realms as to be impossible to access, or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name. 4 is a dirty trick on the audience. it's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say "smorsgabord" and that despite the rating it got on metacritic, no one had heard of it. it's terrible with sugar on top.firstly, there is the ever-present number four from start to finish. while having a little symbolism here and there is okay, and it's been done with various degrees of success in many well-known movies, this movie is panting with it. four dogs at the start of the movie, looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly, machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt. four people in a bar, although one of them is a non-entity. three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless, not only to each other but to what their lives are not. while this concept may work, the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would-be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre, and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation. or maybe, like i said before, i just "didn't get it." the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina's story (which revolves on the death of her sister, from bread-chewing, no less, and the subsequent, shrill mourning which follows) that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace. so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own? the director doesn't invest much time in truly tying them together, or weaving a tighter story that could, in a david lynchian way, intersect either with the past-present, or within alternate dimensions, or even as a straightforward, mundane science-fiction story. this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint (or someone into the weird for weird's sake) could endure.

i'll give writer/director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived "thriller." a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo, let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs. a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes, although the art direction is not half bad. the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit; this is storytelling at its worst. no tension, no suspense, no dread, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom, but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer. i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing. good for late-night, zoned-out viewing only. you have been warned.

a splendid example of how hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up.in the case of "the big sky," writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize-winning author, a.b. guthrie. in so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation.the epic nature of guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, boone caudill, from a naive, kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man, has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent. in the movie version, boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming.intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever. most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character, who was an incidental, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages. on the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, dick summers, the veteran pioneer, is missing altogether!!! it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie, played by actor hunnicutt, wasn't irritating enough. so zeb/hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious, voice-over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing, editing, and direction.some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (william wyler's "ben-hur" is an excellent example). but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself.the story is dull and clichéd, and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie's literary vision. and unfortunately, kirk douglas' star appeal, which could have helped lift this film, was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given.if you can believe it, the film version of guthrie's pulitzer prize-winning sequel, "the way west," also starring kirk, is even worse.in my opinion, "the big sky" further solidifies howard hawks' place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of cinema.

anyone that has see tammuz's child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better. let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot (telefilm anyone?)and that is was a case of second feature jitters. the characters are one dimensional and over used. the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully.the cinematography is great. shot almost entirely outside, the images are crisp and beautiful. you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves.technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart.

this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. this is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices i've made in film rentals.i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it. the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender.the "skits" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of "vince offer" (whoever that is).unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of rubbish.

i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago, and said to myself, "seems funny, plus it has michael clarke duncan, how can i lose!" i proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it. i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted. wooden performances abound. all the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never seemed to arrive. after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame, knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back. i literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered "comedy" i didn't want to believe in movies anymore. my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone. this was my next horrible mistake, because as i watched i just became angry. i began to yell at the movie, and i'm not one to talk to movies period. everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen. my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even. the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding. the fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.

imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie. now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity. now imagine something 50 times worse.got that?ok, now go see the underground comedy movie. that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen. there were a few cheap laughs...very few. but it was lame. even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny.the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it. he wasted his money. vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's no surprise why.

a woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive.the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement.of course b-horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature.the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard.and the last twenty minutes of brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch.the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful.better watch "scalps" or "alien dead" again.of course i ain't expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray,but "haunting fear" is too dull to be enjoyable.

i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. and it was nice, but the movie is trash. i can handle b-grade, i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp (ie. 'surf nazis must die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. this movie has very little to offer.

fred olen ray is a lousy director, even as far as b movie directors go, but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films. yes, it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes, it is badly paced and uneven throughout, but it is also pretty entertaining. scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (jay richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by robert quarry). delia sheppard, a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress. you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic, robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes. the ending didn't make much sense!

first off...with names like fred olen ray, brinke stevens and jan-michael vincent, plus distributors like "rhino" and "troma" on the video box, you know what you're getting into with this one. b movie mania! if you're actually expecting to see a thriller "based on edgar allan poe," then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films. this is pure, unadulterated sleaze (with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to "the premature burial"), complete with lots of r-rated, ready-for-video sex and nudity. however, it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...brinke (who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife victoria monroe, whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father (hoke howell). her worthless husband terry (jay richardson) has racked up some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster played by robert quarry) and, with help from his kinky, blonde, european-accented sexpot secretary lisa (delia sheppard) plots to do away with brinke for her money. name-value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist (she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this), 50s sci-fi/horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living vicki. jan-michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home.the kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before, the ending is an unintentional laugh riot (concluding with a direct rip-off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit. brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role. she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here.

hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward.it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten. there's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops, and habits in a church tower like quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic).there's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything. she happens to look like his mother, yes so what? we know he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o.k. short film. now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change. he is a guy that stuff happens to. the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job.there's this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character. he paints his face, dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead badger on his head. a badger! you've got to see the ending! he returns to his home with the badger on his head (and it is shot like a tacky horror film) to kill his dad's new wife (which he had sex with in the beginning). and somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background. i've got to admit though, i'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. it feels like this mackenzie director/guy/whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school. you are so smart! thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! you really dug! what a wallraff! okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book, but anyway..photowise it is boring. a lot of talking heads. plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene, you know cold and warm etc.. why? maybe "hallam foe" is both a feature and a test film for color blind people. or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they increased blue so that we really get it.i'm not even gonna comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. and all the "cute" sex stuff going on. this whole film is an independent cliché. but i do recommend it. i laughed more than a few times. though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine.

in its way, mister foe (originally, and more appropriately, titled hallam foe  i can't see addressing its title character as "mister"), is a tribute to good acting. both jamie bell, as hallam, a physically attractive voyeur/creep, and sophia myles, as kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life. a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp. and a woman in kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police.these things are not, however, what happens in the movie. poor hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair. hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets he know it. she has sex with him. kate's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games. she looks like his birth mother. it all ends happily with hallam "resolving" his "issues".forty some years ago, the play and brilliantly acted movie, who's afraid of virginia woolf, had a similarly optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart. the trouble is, it doesn't always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. in virginia woolf, the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation. in mister foe, the emotional revelation never really happens.

david mackenzie's follow-up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel-good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho-sexual issues with his dead mother. it wants to be gritty, realistic, and mysterious. at the same time, it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult.to meet this end, the film tries hard to be youthful. its poster has hand-drawn letters looking like that of juno. its original soundtrack is comprised of fast-paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok; just a little misguided. but strangely the film is anything but youthful.like young adam this film's central mystery concerns a drowned woman- in this case hallam's mother. young adam keeps its mystery quiet, contemplative, and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come. hallam foe does the opposite. it foregrounds its character's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters. the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend. hallam swiftly interrupts, asserting his presence in the household. here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie.the mystery surrounding his mother's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father's girlfriend. the audience can never really trust hallam because, besides being creepy, we think his obsession has led him close to insanity. this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable. right when he's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home, at first it appearing to be looking for the police. then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother, which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element.while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character, he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs. this movie is in no way mysterious, yet it is not blunt either. it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues, but it adds a very self-conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite. it goes for a soundtrack-heavy, trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings, picks locks, and camps out for the sake of voyeurism. these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward-drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy, giddy, or pleasant. they are more neutral than anything; not propelling the character or story. mackenzie makes you understand hallam, yet he fails to build common ground.he expects you to enjoy hallam's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification. the film hinges on its audience's perspective on voyeurism/the kind of person who engages in it. obviously, most people would be disgusted by it. and hallam foe realizes that, but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions. he goes from person to person, trying to fill his deep void. there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam's love interest kate where she drunkenly says "i love creepy boys," perhaps asking the audience to do the same. the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him (her motivation remains vague throughout) and tries to further us from judging him. it's not hard to like hallam, but it is very hard to participate in his adventure- if it is even an adventure at all. all the while, the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood.great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act, muddy development, and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie. recently this film was re-named for a us release, and for what reason? not only is it more unappealing, but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title 'mister.'

i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee. but then, in poland in 2000, i watched it in a complete form. and so what? the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong, straight and fundamentally severe ladies. the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive, constant masculine desire for sex, feminists who are shown like complete idiots (you may agree with them or not, but idiots certainly they are not), and so on. the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like "i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her!". this was intended to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a vapid farce, full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos. do not waste your time on it - this is just bad.

once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing. i just recently reviewed baby face nelson. now i've seen dillinger and i've had it.this movie is garbage. i don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde. this movie is far from a classic. someone called it brilliant. that's an insane thing to say. this movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i've ever seen. i don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger. first of all he looks nothing like him. second of all, by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31. when oates made this he was 45! you could even tell that he's older than the real dillinger just by looking at him. not only was he too old, but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis.they show baby face nelson die, then homer van meter, and finally john dillinger. john dillinger was killed before both of them. the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson. not only do the writers not know when they died, but they also don't know how they died. baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe. homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns. homer van meter was cornered by the police in st. paul and gunned down with machine guns. another member of dillinger's gang, harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie. pierpont wasn't shot. harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair. i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i'm not going to go into it again here. let me also add that richard dreyfuss' portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic. there's a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating. while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming, "leave me alone!" baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought. maybe dillinger didn't agree with nelson's bank robbing methods, but they never fought. nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten. they keep calling him lester "baby face" nelson. he was never in his life known by that name. nelson's real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson. the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood, but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood. john milius doesn't know anything. where the hell did john milius get his information? i could probably make a better movie than him.finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable. the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette. by the way, billie frechette wasn't even there that night. but a girl named polly hamilton was. melvin purvis yells, 'johnny!' dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell. it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night. the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away. they didn't even have to shoot him. they were so close that powder burns were found on his face. it was murder. they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger. after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man? the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger's death. i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't john dillinger, but i'll stop here. if you would like to know more check it out heresee the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want, but don't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie.

i just finished reading a book about dillinger. this movie was horribly inaccurate. it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. his robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. they had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left. purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed, only photos of him. the way his gang members died were fictitious. dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. if i had never read the book, maybe i could have enjoyed the movie. the acting was a bit over the top in places. the action was overdone as well. on second thought, i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book.

proof why hollywood conventions are in place. stale dialogue, underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe. an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap-together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn 's bonnie and clyde (1967) and george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid (1969)- truly innovative filmmakers and films - but falling well below the bar. problems with storylines being self-explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections. the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically. unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor. stills, black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can't transition well or to replace scenes that just didn't work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid (1969).overly dramatic pauses between sentences, random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn't needed for storytelling plus over-the-top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980's - i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post-production. the playing of music in most two shots and close-ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score. no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots, doors, footsteps and dialogue (a style used in the late 60's through the mid-70's by new directors) but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads. in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no 'likeable' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story. neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the 'hero'- a necessity for any story to work for me. we know from penn's and hill's movies who the 'heroes' are. even though they are criminals, we like them and want to see them get away. i could care less who was on the screen in this film. i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non-historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger's life from june 1933 to july 1934 (his death).to be fair, there are some moments of good solid storytelling, which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits. john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn't seem to try to 'copy' other filmmakers. dillinger (1973) isn't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial 'big budget' debut, but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy.

near the beginning, after it's been established that outlaw john dillinger (warren oates), is an egomaniacal rapist, another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi. second-in-command melvin purvis (ben johnson), surveys the situations, sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded .45-caliber automatics, and stalks off into the distant house alone. bang, bang, bang. purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the female hostage, the miscreant dead. all in long shot.if you're enthralled by stories like red riding hood, this should have considerable appeal.oh, it's as exciting as it is mindless. pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically. multiple violations of the civic code. plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols. blood all over.as history, it stinks. few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero, partly, i would guess, because of his name. melvin purvis? we all remember j. edgar hoover, who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though.the picture was written and directed by john milius. he's the guy who had it written into his contract that, should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. milius is the guy, a compleat gun freak, who had teddy roosevelt's rough riders in the spanish-american war shouting quotations from henry v -- "saint crispin's day" and all that.exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "i knew i'd never take him alive, and i didn't try too hard neither." that is, kill 'em all and let god sort them out.you'll just love it.

anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, must have seen a film or two by american international pictures, a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films. wherever movie-goers ventured, aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead;' in the 60s were frankie avalon-annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers;' and into the 70s, aip churned out grindhouse-level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill.''dillinger,' released in 1973, is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven, over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned. on the whole, 'dillinger' is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, 'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director john milius ('magnum force') but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.the 109-minute 'dillinger' - epic for aip's scope - follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis, played by academy award winner ben johnson. purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice. at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout, including expert bankrobber john dillinger (warren oates), pretty boy floyd (steve kanaly), and psychopath baby face nelson (richard dreyfuss). dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson, taking along homer van meter (harry dean stanton) and harry pierpont (geoffrey lewis). he also hooked up with billie frechette (michelle phillips), a prostitute of french and indian extraction. while taking place over several months in 1933-4, 'dillinger' is basically a chase film, with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j. edgar hoover.'dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis. milius keeps an honest depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts. the film is never boring, moving at a quick, if haphazard, pace. the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint, edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort. thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film, not to mention pounds of explosives. this film is certainly not for the squeamish, with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place. the violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life.this film never transcends its exploitation status, however, because the needed writing just isn't there. john milius, somewhat overrated as a filmmaker, places way too much emphasis on action. the action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde.' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward. melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling. all too often, the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.aside from this, the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact. while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film, it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent. those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe. in fact, dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have billie frechette in tow. while these inaccuracies might make for high drama, there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing. oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the american press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime. ben johnson gives some life to purvis, suave but rather flat. michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger. we never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger. the supporting roles with kanaly, dreyfuss, stanton, lewis, and a briefly-appearing cloris leachman, are acceptable for such talent.as a piece of 1970s exploitation, 'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins, which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for $4.99. the film is nicely presented in widescreen (a must for drive-in flicks) with subtitles in french and spanish. dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra. largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts, the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material. for fans of the genre, it's certainly worth checking out.** out of 4roving reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr

i recently watched this film at the 30'th gothenburg film festival, and to be honest it was on of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to watch. don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g "manos  hands of fate") and then there are the awful bad films. (this one falls into the latter category). the cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between "one guy running around with a light bulb" and "non existing". the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la jason vorhees from "friday the 13'th". the plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse. i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep.

it's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. but the problem is that it's not very good. there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn't bother for any of them.rather bland (and sometimes downright bad) photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it. it's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high-budget films. but alas, that is what one must do. on its own, it's not very good. and compared to others, it's still not very good. but it is not without its good points! i liked the plot. it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end. sometimes in the really dark scenes, it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well.however in the end the film fails to impress. the characters are pretty much non-existent and we don't care for any of them. any of them might die, but it's possible to pinpoint the final "survivor" from very early on.

"i love new york" is another entry by vh-1 (mtv networks) showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill, obnoxious, woman. it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest, ebonics speaking, craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. many will argue, "this is a show". true, it's not as bad as it's previous show, "flavor of love" - but it's just as bad.it reminds me of a skit from the 90's show "in living color" where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on "the love connection" dating show and he picked "robin givens" for a date. mike talked of how the date was okay, but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in. this show reminds me of that.the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more - (i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv.) but these are professional reality actors, so why bother.it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this. the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (well, you can't hate them for trying to make a buck.) maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour? or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the wwf! any way you slice it, it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil.no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck, or any different from any of the others. appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an "end" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end, immediately.

the latest rumor going around is that vh1 is starting casting calls for i love new york 3 mid 2008. so does this mean budah or tailor made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the winner?i know flavor of love is coming up to it's 3rd season, so now with a flavor of love 3 and a i love new york 3.....will there ever be a true winner???i've also heard a few rumors that chance will be brought back for the 3rd season of i love new york!!!! i have also heard rumors that new york will be specially featured on flavor of love 3. hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of i love new york 2....i'm just stating the latest rumor.

the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students... to learn how not to make a film!let's see... what did the crew mess up in this flick? worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all-time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc. let's face it, if this "film" had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white, and silent... it still would have been awful. all scenes are dark (lighting people call it "black"), often, the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs, which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. the "evil" robot was hilarious... what was that? jazz dancing? oh... i guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something. i'm sure it struck fear into the hearts... of the poor editors. and, how do you edit so much footage of garbage? not possible. garbage is garbage, no matter how you splice it. how did anyone ever get this thru the dailys???bottom line is- i couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad... but i did see the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had any good parts in it at all. nope! none!a perfect example of how not to make a flick... a must see for every serious film student!!!

this is one of those "so bad it is good" films that you always hear about but never see! unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy (and i am not amused) this one is 100% pure serious.however with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining.watcheable enough because of that.

i find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom, american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers, messiah of evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off.the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. it doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror.the surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great elisha cook jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino.part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with messiah of evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - wrap scene' blur hopelessly.take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary. while we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, messiah of evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'dark stranger' who came from the woods one day. in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years (you can hear the mst3k line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater.i generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. the general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. add to that the choppy editing, average acting and hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and i'd file messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.

i just watched this movie in high definition on television. i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. he was a great man. but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that i found it insulting.first of all, they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film. further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. what? they couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee? at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am.figure that out.

i was so disappointed in this movie. i don't know much about the true story, so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history. with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination. well, somewhere the screenplay failed them. it was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? i'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story, but this movie wasn't it. i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. other small gripes: 1. the heavy-handed soundtrack. it's the seventies - we get it already! 2. if he's such a phenomenal public speaker, why weren't we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages?

what about dahmer's childhood?- the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? what about "infinity land"? - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger. what about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father? his feelings of neglect when his brother was born? what about his fascination with insects and animals? how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?what about focusing more on his cannibalism? and what about his parent's divorce? these are all things that should have been included in the film. instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down 'snapshot' from a night or two in his life, and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks, to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer.why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people? he could have made this point many times, particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them (which actually took place in a health club, not a night club). instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind.whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes (or however long), but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet? (known as rodney in this film). my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet's character, to try and make us fear for or empathise with him, but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer, so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else? if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough, but it wasn't. the scene in which he kills steven hicks, his first victim, is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing, and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life. unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing, or that he didn't kill again for nine years. we assume, because his hair style is different, and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback, but to when? and why? what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career?-one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations..some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal, but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth, it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed. why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued?finally, a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate, not a 15. we needed to see his perversion in more depth, to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us. that doesn't mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone's head for instance, but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed, and what his modus operandi was when actually killing. anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people. he actually killed seventeen men.aside from the facts and lack of depth, the film isn't all bad. there is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters. i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge, more energy, and a better reason for making the film in the first place.

yeah, well, i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little, yet very long, movie. apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life. here's the epitome of the antihero in 'no regrets.' we have this jerk, so messed up, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's up-and-coming son, jaemin, unless it was just that: physical attraction. he claims otherwise, that it's love. but after watching this, it's like loving charles manson because you dig the beard. (alright, he's not that bad, but still no real redeemable characteristics.) i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin. it was never shown, just told, that jaemin loves sumin. perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy/stalking = mad love over in seoul. it has to be, because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy. i was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to make an appearance. okay, so sumin works two jobs while going to school, so far so good on someone trying to better themselves. but after his first taste of his stalker's attraction, he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring. what? ok, well, as previously mentioned, the obsession doesn't stop due to the job/career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup. basic movie, not 100% terrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.

no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am.i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash, since i also see he had made the three/four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well.not so royal flash.i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time, and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel (i still am, but he was never really given a chance after that).what a disappointment (i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse).none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen. the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda.if you have read the book and not seen the film, i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented: russian roulette.a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently, but i am glad i have not.if by any chance fraser ever reads this, i can only say i think he is a genius--perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of that corpus of work, it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films.

as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser, i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester. the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers' for me and the same applies here. to me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. this is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. when i first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star oliver reed. i rejoiced, as reed to me was the epitome of flashman. how i would have loved to see him in the role. malcolm mcdowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck. what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet (tom bell). a great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell. possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom', adapted by mr fraser, worked quite well. perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen.

raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend (dick foran) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (angela lansbury). this was a full year before he started doing perry mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting.there isn't all that much else here that's interesting though. lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. there's an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who's also in love with the "femme fatale", but the burr character is pretty straightforward. it's frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury, and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i've seen him in. there's no mystery at all really, and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr's character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself (double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder, presumably). he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn't notice when she comes into the room i guess.a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv.

this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy-mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow; the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.

i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest, and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make. and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it. as far as i'm concerned, landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license went way over the top, similar to his massacre of the "little house" book series is proof. the acting, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the screenplay sloppy, and there are more close-ups of landon's puss than should be allowed.this movie reflects everingham's story as much as "little house on the prairie" reflects the books is was "based" on. it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair.

there is so much that is wrong with this film, but to sum it up: terrible acting- so bad it must have been on purpose. poor script - they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad ending- in some cases the ending manages to save the film-not in this case. if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for. this is the worst film i have seen in a long time. it was complete torture sitting through this film, i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance. so do yourself a favor. watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture.

i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable. the plot was weak to say the least. i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up (i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs?). at least i didn't pay to rent it. the best part of the film is definitely dani behr, but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants.

must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time, but this one is up there with the worst of them. plot troubling to follow. sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film.i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two. sadly, in my case, i have the dvd. it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.

i have seen bad films but this took the p***. made no sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count. its that good. a welshman plays a sweary cockney. a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy, and some lesser lights play dim tarts.and there are some russian gangsters. oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.avoid this film like the plague.

we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie. a waste of time. the premise was not too bad. but one workable idea (interaction between real bussinessmen and russian mafia) is not followed by an intelligent script

...the first film i had to walk out on. and it was the cast and crew pre-screening (not that i was involved, i hasten to add). i made it through the first hour, so i reckon i'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit.like other comments here, how did this get through any kind of qa. an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue, the epitome of wooden acting, awful casting, all wrapped together without a plot.tara fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comic. she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history.as i left the screening, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. they obviously couldn't sit through it again either.

how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure? horrible script, annoyingly hectic camera, awfully edited, gruesomely badly acted. only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life. another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "dreck". why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand? do yourself a favour: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees. it's less painful and more fun than this movie!

just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film, i decided to write another review. i missed a few things out last time...first, the script. second, the acting. third, jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax!!!i can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something!are you getting the picture?

this is a truly abysmal `lock stock' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script. i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed. a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after 10 minutes. not the worst film ive ever seen, that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie' (i use the term loosely) `gummo' (i feel like suing that so called `director' for the lost hour and a half of my life) but this trash is nearly right down there with it. definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen. stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films.

i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. that has been done in great detail already, many times over. the 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles. anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen.i am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason i went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene. it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan's face in the bar in 'russia' (it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island). my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part. having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd, i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets. this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.

there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie. i never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince. fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian. when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. as the for the major problem....the plot....was there one? i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous. save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!

this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors, so what went wrong? i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film.....

words really can't describe how bad this film is. i thought zandalee was bad, but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. this is just laughable! terrible script, poor direction, awful acting and you know what? i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long. if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!). incidentally, i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. it is terrible!

this film is about a man's life going wrong. his business is failing, and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts.the plot is complete chaos. it simply does not make sense. in fact, nothing in the film makes sense. the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it. it is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. the shots are well composed throughout the film. however, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. it is such a waste of their talents. this film is very bad. avoid it!!

i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in russia. in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 dollars..you drink and talk", but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could, so i declined to take this speaking part on. i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "i'll be back" and "quite frankly my dear, i don't give a damn". had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski. as time goes on, i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.even though i spent a whole day on the set, in south wales hot-spot barry island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....still.....on the positive side....i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break. i had no idea who he was, as "notting hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be welsh. made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production........

in the wake of lock, stock and two smoking barrels, the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s-early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then. in one of the all-time great cases of pearls-from-swine, the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'the best film of the century' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because, at the time of writing, it was the only film that had been released in 2000. looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made, uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannia's lads mags brigade  rhys ifans, sadie frost, nick moran and joseph fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel. that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no-one really knows what it is, or perhaps simply don't think it matters. something to do with ifans' businessman being set up with steven berkoff's homicidal russian crime lord in a money-laundering or investment scheme (it's never clear which because no-one ever asks) by fiennes' crooked irish accountant, who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company. things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on, ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgerald's ludicrously accented russian temptress, berkoff keeps on saying "bizniss" and "francis drake" and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts.when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr, you know a film is in deep trouble. with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget, it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own, sitting there like a joke shop dog turd.

i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch. one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience. the best performances weren't anything to do with acting. in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary. do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash.

i usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films, but i can not believe this got past the script stage. the dialogue is appalling, the acting very dodgy, the accents just awful, and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best.i don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad. joseph fiennes, pretty as he is, might just have killed his career as quickly as it started.the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage.

i read james hawes book. it was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough. without having read the book i wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe. half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.never before or since as a film made me feel so angry. the mattress sequels came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james hawes without feeling angry. that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh*t. no, that's unfair. let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is rancid aluminium.plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema.

where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes? the over-the-top acting? the dreadful script?no. you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at. i know i do. i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags). however, cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product.i went three days after it opened with two other mates. the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.and that was on cheap night.either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.not since the days of the avengers (1998) have i felt so short changed since watching a movie. if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary.mind you, considering she used to be in the word, any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with.the production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious. if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say "fak!" for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.otherwise, bargepoles required.

this is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word " plot " is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such . there's something involving russian gangsters , a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant , and an irish bloke called sean . how they all fit into something called a " plot " i'm not sure . it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching . sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent . steven berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable . i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now i've mainly forgotten why . but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely

in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and "king arthur", on dvds chosen by others for an evening's "entertainment" and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination, and is content as long as they get "action". both movies were utter rubbish.whatever happened to character development? whatever happened to meaningful dialogue? whatever happened to acting? and, when watching something that vaguely purports to be "historical", whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of the "political map" of the time, even some slight flavour of the era, especially in its social attitudes. why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america? i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that "little was known" of the dark ages. not so. considerable amounts are known, with much learned scholarship on the era, but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework.i only wish i could vote 0/10

elizabeth ward gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (they have pills for that now!) is probably the weakest element of this show. it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.then you have the character of nick wolf. basically, your typical unshaven 90's hero, with the typical "sexual tension" storyline. (seriously, why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) this was a joint canadian/french production, so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york, and the other half is in paris... just like highlander did.

by far the worst movie of all time. even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey. i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "the treasure" but was changed to "sharks' treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "jaws". i think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. didn't work. anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? could they have made it any more obvious? the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. that's cause enough for celebration.

you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great. the premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey.the script is blasé'. the actors don't have much to work with. the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs. it's a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the movie has no budget.lack of budget is okay, if there's a story. "solarbabies" and "blood of champions" are examples of decent work from no $. but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich. again, forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck.finally, this movie commits the biggest crime of all: it doesn't finish! it simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. but the rest never comes. just odd.just bad.

there is a word for this sort of film, and that word is "drivel." it was drivel when it was a vhs rental, and it's drivel on satellite re-runs now.it might fool you, because it has 2 moderately well-known names in kistofferson and henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music, and nice monument valley scenery.it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot.if that's all you want from a movie, then maybe this will keep you happy.it's still drivel, though.

this movie will promote the improvement of the mind. read a book! it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make. i've seen "b" movies before but the "c" movie has just been invented. i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into "knights." high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume. embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. my roommate, who loves these types of movies even turned it off. now that has to really tell you something. if you watch this movie, and like it, i will pray for you.

i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran, so i didn't know who had done it at first. the longer i saw it, the more i started thinking, "jesus, this looks like an albert pyun flick." wasn't quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good (and the utah desert scenery was beautiful), and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon, a murderous cyborg, but with some style and a sense of humor. paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out, because albert pyun hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career. unfortunately, paulin doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone, and the movie's the worse for it. lance henriksen, playing the evil head cyborg, growls his way through his part, as he's done in countless other movies like this. i don't know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it. he goes through the movie looking (and sounding) like he just woke up, and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent. kathy long, the nominal hero, has a great body, is attractive, has a great body, fights extremely well, has a great body, and doesn't have an iota of acting talent, but that doesn't matter in a movie like this. this being an albert pyun film, it's full of the trademarks that we've all come to know and love: inane and idiotic dialog, choppy editing, and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured, "ah, nobody'll ever notice."as bad as this movie is, however, it's a shade above most of pyun's other efforts--this is "citizen kane" compared to his brain-numbing "adrenaline: feel the rush", for example. the fights are pretty well done, if repetitive (after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other, you find yourself saying, "alright already, go to something else"), and long is very athletic (and, as a previous poster has noted, has a great derrière). it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun's usual extravaganzas. you could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse, granted, but worse nonetheless.

in the ravaged wasteland of the future, mankind is terrorized by cyborgsrobots with human featuresthat have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. commanded by their vicious leader jōb (lance henriksen), the cyborgs prepare to overtake taos, a densely populated human outpost.only one force can stop jōb's death marchthe cyborg gabriel (kris kristofferson), who is programmed to destroy jōb and his army.in the ruins of a ransacked village, gabriel finds nea (kathy long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborgs ten years earlier. now she wants revenge. they strike a pact: gabriel will train nea how to fight the cyborgs and nea will lead gabriel to taos.five-time kick-boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high-speed adventure that delivers plenty of action. also stars gary daniels (as david) and scott paulin (as simon).

this is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that albert pyun made in 1993 - and it's the bad one. apparently all his energy went into "nemesis" which was an entertaining non-stop action movie, and had a much more expensive look. "knights" is clunky and cheesy, a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game (new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible). the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine. as for kris kristofferson, considering his age at the time (58), i hope his stunt double was well paid.

in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life. the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small, and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. that said, "casanova" left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski: "casanova died too, just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all. to say that he lived well is true; to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true. the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find; that is why the human race stands where it does today: we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas, all hollow inside, like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children." as far as i could make it out, this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject; granted, with more empathy, but disgusted nonetheless.casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior, themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in "satyricon". the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn, just without the coherence; and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction.yet, there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool. and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious; fellini couldn't. more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro, for sure, but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else. i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film. it was a story not worth telling.

i should explain why i gave this..."piece of art" 1 star rating out of possible 10. simply because it's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased. probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have followed.i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so - i think that's disgusting and pretty terrible (in all the possible contextual meanings), but as i found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it (and made kill bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible). but the thing about "historical drama" genre is that it's a sub-category of the "trash movies" where john romero is the undead-gory-emperor-of-the-guts and so automatically it can't be rated as your default movie - as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so, or it was simply bad. it's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting, bad screenplay and bad everything else. and by some turn of faith - i am one of them too. there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go - the day is saved! but that's definitely an opinion of mine and doesn't have match with anyones' else.what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie - then fellini's casanova is definitely the choice, but heed my advice and don't rate it by default means.

1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10(dir-jim kammerud & brian smith): drab and un-spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated `101 dalmatians.' yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first one, but the problem is that it plays out much like the original. one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story, which this one doesn't have. the animation is also very un-spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again. when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re-do's etc.. etc. probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out.

i was very unimpressed with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2, but this is possibly worse than both titles. first of all, i didn't like the animation, very saturday-morning-cartoon, only worse in some scenes. i liked some of the characters, namely thunderbolt and patch, but the other characters, like cruella were mediocre. cruella was truly villainous in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly. also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you, and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight. the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt, with the exception of jodi benson, the accent ruined it for me. there were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed bloated for me, and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode. all in all, a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book. sorry, i can only give this a 3/10, it just wasn't my cup of tea. bethany cox

i mean the word "pedestrian". seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen. faith domergue can do better than this. she is supposed to be the mysterious, vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson (there's an idea, eh?). instead she's a common would-be housewife of the fifties, and the single, flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee. as for the rest of the cast, they are all so earnestly "all-american" that the result is laughable. this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in "the cat people". i think "cult of the cobra" should really be titled "cult of the contractual obligation". why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow-moving, predictable, derivative failure like this?

faith domergue (better known as "dr. ruth" in this island earth) is the only reason to watch this film. the story is very thin, and once the air force buddies return to the states with a cobra curse upon them the action is just a waiting game. see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest isn't happening.

cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie. unfortunately, that is not saying much.it has a competent cast of second-rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances. it is efficiently directed, entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot. it looks ok, but is ponderously over-plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded.for example, the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too many.the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything. tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia (nor is she).julia's 'feminine intuition' is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development, but it doesn't. similarly, pete's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time.these are just symptoms of the underlying problem. the movie is structured like a mystery but it isn't. as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading, so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know.the ending is particularly lame. julia is menaced purely by accident. lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her, it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all. he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done.it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads. then it occurred to me. someone said: "those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko, so why don't we make one like that?"cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people: mysterious, troubled, shape-shifting woman falls in love with the hero, is apparently frigid, kills people, arouses the suspicions of the hero's woman friend and dies at the end. but 'modelled on' doesn't mean 'as good as' - by a wide margin. it copies, but doesn't understand what it is copying.it is obviously trying for the low-key, suggestive lewton style, but this approach doesn't follow through into the story. lisa is no irene. she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her. we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia, so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york. there is never any doubt about her purpose. neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake.then again, during her nocturnal prowling we get, not one, but two attempts at 'buses'. neither come off, because the director doesn't understand what makes a 'bus' work and, in any case, they happen to the stalker, not the person being stalked.these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have, but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation.plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery, but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time-passer came out.

six gis, about to be send home and discharged, get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia. surrounded by hooded figures, two male dancers pretend to have a fight. behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck. the imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights. (this is definitely a female imitation snake.) the cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and, most definitely, no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed. naturally, the gis take a flash photo, send the cult members into an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and run off with it into the asian night.one of the guys, the most offensive and snarky, dies from a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room.back in new york, it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives, still maintaining their bond with one another. their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley (david janssen) to graduate research student (richard long). james dobson, jack kelly, and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood. richard long has a nice blond girl friend. kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy.then a dark, shifty-looking, mysterious woman (faith domergue) shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group.guess what happens. first janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash. then kelly gets a visit from domergue. something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk. long and dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that domergue has had something to do with the deaths. they also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra, which is the case. dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point.by this time long and thompson are thoroughly frazzled, particularly thompson, who is in love with domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, too, although he must explain to her what "love" is. no matter. a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against long's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and thompson must throw the snake out the window. on the pavement below, the body changes to that of domergue. the end.i think i'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises. i'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing. who paid for domergue's fare from somewhere in asia to new york? who's paying her utility bills in the hotel? who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? how come she speaks american english so well? what the hell's going on? the writers and director have clearly seen some of val lewton's modest horror films and, though not much effort has gone into this production, they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from lewton. in lewton's "the cat people", for instance, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it. most of the transformations here use shadows too, but unlike lewton's, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous.lewton also made occasional use of what he called "buses". lewton's first "bus" was a literal one. a potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of central park with only the sound of footsteps. something or someone is following her. she freezes with fright under a street lamp. something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her. she looks upward. there is a loud, wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end. it's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her. the producers used at least two "buses" in this film and they amount to nothing. a guy is walking distractedly across an intersection, for instance, and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him. there is no set up to the shot. it's jammed in with a shoe horn.i don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy, ugly, venomous, and phallic. as a matter of fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful. furthermore, they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals. you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? try a six-lined racerunner. it's a really fast lizard. when it sees something to eat, it rushes up and gobbles it down.anyway, if you want to see some fine, low-budget scary films, don't bother with this one. find "the cat people" or one of lewton's other minor masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy.

the first half of this movie is a pure delight. novel. funny. wonderful performances. a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman! adult. bright. witty. what more could you ask. as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing. it heads into unexplored territory. and then it falls apart.it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming-of-age coming-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times before. what a disappointment. as a people film it begins with such promise. why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian "i am who i am" film. the freeze-frame ending shot of heather graham's jumping in the air to celebrate "her happiness at finding herself" underlines the banality of the last part of the film.it could have been different. it could have been magical. it ended up being the same old same old.

this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year. you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are spoilers. gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin (heather graham and tom cavanagh). only gray and sam are brother and sister; living together in everyone else's eyes as man and wife. no sex but just about everything else. early on, the movie starts with its theme: 'the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions'. gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too. when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date. charlie (bridget moynahan) is the girl of their dreams, like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! that charlie accepts! in one week charlie, gray and sam are to be in vegas. in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns (apparently charlie has an off-the-rack figure). gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $10,000 frock for her. while charlie is zipping her in this 'down-payment-on-a-house' gown gray continues to slurp on the latte (i swear it was like a feed bag). what should happen but 'woops!' latte all over the gown. it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale's bridal salon with out a $10,000 mocha colored gown. back to 'reality'  caesar's palace las vegas. they have the 'high roller room' (sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money?) gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were, you guessed it - they kiss. gray remembers everything; charlie remembers nada. they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line "if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds" gray gets the hiccups. gray excuses herself, for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again 'hiccups'. gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets, literally. and of course one is you guessed it again! gay. the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver (alan cummings) named gordy. he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned. they become great friends. this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss. he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment. when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office. gray works at an ad agency. this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone. it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency. sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office. this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew: gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar. 'sorry no men' says the bouncer. so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag. bad drag. he was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse, a string of pearls, and a grandma's church hat. no lesbian would ever confuse this 'man in a dress' as a drag queen much less a woman. the bar was also the straight man's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is: full of victoria's secret models. everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firm's client. gray happens to be on the woman's account and finally does more then kiss. for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray, but that is for the sequel.

i wish i'd known more about this movie when i rented it. i'd put it in my queue on the basis of heather graham and her strong cred as an actress (imho). while parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. not to mention the ick factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... i don't care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. and charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other homo sapiens. what was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made gray fall for her? the story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. high points - molly shannon (although i do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion), the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences (if sam & gray were such great dancers, i wish we'd seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). could have been better.

i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end... having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom. what really horrifies me, i mean truly disturbs me, is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as 'delightful' or a 'must see.' i would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants.the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten. it is decidedly unfunny, poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold, canned rice pudding. to be kind to ms kramer, the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity, for having read the synopsis before i watched it, i had expected something more challenging. the possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co-dependence, the unexpected awakening of 'sisterly' sexuality, and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry (for the affections of the same girl) were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration, yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from.instead, the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations, with clichéd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction. the lack of directorial control seems astounding; on the one hand, moynahan, cavanagh and spacek all give very pedestrian performances, while heather graham and molly shannon - the latter in particular - veer towards embarrassing over-compensation at times. one could lay the blame for this on the director - maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over-act, they will force a bigger laugh from the audience. but then again, the cast is a veteran one; one would expect them to do better.sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make, and for whom. given the possible issues gray matters alludes to, and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy, perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead. i know it is never easy to make films about women and women's issues, especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone, but whatever direction she takes, inconsequential and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut mustard.

sam (thomas cavanagh) and gray (heather graham) are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things -- ballroom dancing, 1940s movie musicals and, much to their surprise, an attractive woman named charlie (bridget moynahan). historically heterosexual, gray is confused by her new feelings.gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen. it's dull, predictable, unfunny, poorly acted and poorly written. nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy. also, this isn't really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a "coming out" movie. sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part. unfortunately, she failed miserably. the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little. then, the film took an awkward tone and got all serious. the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony.i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic. the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn't really appear to be that close. their relationship just didn't feel very natural. also, the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural. if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week, then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are. there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters.the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast. heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie. she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it's too bad that all of her co-stars were complete duds. bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level. also, it seemed like she was reading her lines. thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion. the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony. i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying. sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them. finally, alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn't very good. overall, gray matters is a lame film and it isn't worth watching. rating 3/10

if there has ever been a worse comedy than 'gray matters' i am unaware of it. the new york jewish comedy's 'funny' premise is that siblings sam & gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix sam up with a girlfriend, only to find that gray is equally attracted to their target - charlie. the revelation that gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. there is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing 'drunk act' from moynahan and graham, and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from tom cavanagh. sissy spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume. molly shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance. only alan cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and given nothing with which to work. the whole disaster is cemented by graham's bizarre eye-rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. it is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs.

it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience, to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most. however, this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ). her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. this film might have been more, as there was suitable budget for settings, actors and a decent story line. my wife and i both agreed that this was 'muck' at the end, as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high! better luck next time, hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell.

please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you. damn cheek if you ask me. i waited for something to happen - it never did. i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through. i always have to see it through to the end. what a huge mistake. do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining. please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you. damn cheek if you ask me. i waited for something to happen - it never did. i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through. i always have to see it through to the end. what a huge mistake. do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining.

saw it at ucsb's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. i wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. i thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then i learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. while the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. seems as though "serious" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- nick and kate cops out and includes all three. please, be more original!oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. does anyone else thing so?

the director tries to be quentin tarantino, the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams, deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway, the late james coburn tries to be orson welles, michael rooker tries to be gene hackman, mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway (older version), cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), don't ask about joanna going. eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. it delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright. visit tulsa, don't watch this movie. it doesn't do the location justice.

i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie, either. it has some big names in the cast, but that's it. there is nothing else to recommend, save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films.the story involves nothing but unlikable, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that national film critics all seem to like....and most of the public can't stand. the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable, the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.

this one is just like the 6th movie. the movie is really bad. it offers nothing in the death department. the one-liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a noes movie. freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. the characters are extremely underdeveloped. all in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. my rating 2/10

come on. the new twist is nearly ok, but from avenging the elm street children freddy is just killing people now. more of the same: special effects with no actual character development or anything. simply bad and insulting. scary..? nope. not at all. just bad.

bottom-of-the-freddy barrel. this is the worst film in the series, beating "freddy's revenge" for that title. a cheap-looking (with mediocre special effects), incoherent mess, with freddy turned into a punster. he has one or two cool lines, but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel.

it's getting worse, the series is on a serious down fall. the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really, really terrible movies. robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can't act. the story is alice, having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again. this time, the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child. his intention is to be "born again" into the real world. the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother, but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son? check out the first three, miss the next three then watch the last one.

this film is so incredibly bad, that i almost felt sick watching it. up until this point, the other installments had at least one good thing about it. part 1 was suspenseful and gory. part 2 was off beat and entertaining. part 3 was interesting with great effects. part 4 had great music, good special effects, and a new entertaining freddy krueger. part 5 is more boring than anything i've ever seen before. alice, a much prettier blond, from part 4 is back with her boyfriend dan. at parts, this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap. the newer characters seem harsh, and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder. freddy seems to be completely out of this one. he looks tired, and doesn't seem to be as gruesome. his one-liners seem out of place and different, where as in part 4 they could be pretty funny. leslie bohem's story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins' direction is so bad, that it makes my grandmother look good! the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. it's also confusing and pretty stupid. avoid part 5 at all costs!

i am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one, or vice versa. being that it is nearly fifteen years since i saw this film, the fact that i remember so little about it does not bode well. perhaps it is simply because i only watched it once or twice, but i doubt it. if there was anything worth remembering about this film, you can rest assured i would remember it.at the time this film was released, the franchise was still entering its dying phase, so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it. it's never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics. one such article had to explain that freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans, so he decides to go after alice's unborn son. so far, so good, but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience. it should not be left to some unrelated publication.making use of the trivia given in part three about freddy's conception, one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the "horror for infants" category, but alas, that was not to be. it goes to show the sheer idiocy of the american ratings system that a piece of b'harni-esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original.by this time, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, lisa wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting. or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast. either way, given that her last role was in something called the all new adventures of chastity blade, i doubt she really had anything else going for her. even poor old robert englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years.given that box office returns were in a steady decline, and not just for this franchise, at the time, one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable. in fact, this particular film, like its immediate predecessor, was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience, both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise. despite this, part five must be given some credit for not having the bright, luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at.i gave a nightmare on elm street part five a one out of ten. by trying to appeal to everyone, or the mpaa's idea of everyone, it succeeds in appealing to noone. like parts two and four, one could erase it from the continuity entirely, and nobody would notice the difference.

i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series. it was so boring that i couldn't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over, it even tires me to write a review on it.okay, #4 was a joke and freddy was the joker. #5 tried to return to the roots of the series. it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy. unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares. because of that nightmare 5: the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary. what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of lisa wilcox).the plot (freddy killing lisa's friends by using the dreams of lisa's unborn child) has a good base but it just isn't enough for 90 minutes of film. sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because there isn't any) and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at. the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself (let me say that i don't like cheese though, even if i am from switzerland). not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4.don't bother to rent/buy this film if not for completeness, it's quite a mess.my rating: 4/10 (get used to it, #6 is also a messy one...)

like freddy's revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy.  i've not alot to say about this. it's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four, but not worth watching a movie over. uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning alice, having defeated freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to re-adjust her life. but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence- freddy, trying to come out into their world again.it's interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films- charles russell (eraser, the mask) renny harlin (the long kiss goodnight, cutthroat island, cliffhanger, die hard 2) and here stephen hopkins (lost in space, predator 2.) but while russell and harlin made a good job of it, hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry, that should be quickly forgotten.the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here, with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby. even at about an hour and a half, it all gets rather tiresome, and of course, not scary at all.the "bon appetit, bitch" catch-phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry. *

"the dream child" of 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) "nightmare" series, and at the latest from this point on, the series became total garbage. the only good films in the series were wes craven's 1984 original, and the third part, "the dream warriors" of 1987. the second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals, and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence. the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses, who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams. lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as a super-dumb 'eerie' children's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel... in short: no originality, just a decline of the old formula, and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes. my (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals, and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel, "freddy's dead", which is awful beyond belief. in case you're not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast, "the dream child" should be avoided, and even if you are, this is more than likely to disappoint.

i will stat of with the plot alice, having survived the previous instalment of the nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again. this time, the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child. his intention is to be "born again" into the real world. the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother, but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son? this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy again.alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its' no long before freddy start to kill again, i did like the first dead it okay, not as good as the other deaths or dreams.freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie at all, the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all.acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull. (still not worst movie of the series, freddy dead is the worst)4/10

although i am generally a proponent of the well-made film, i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries, and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully "break the rules." and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.pasolini's work is visually jarring, but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed, and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. this is true of decameron. pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable result, under pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. this is also true of decameron. pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock, offend, or otherwise disconcert the audience. such elements can often be used with startling effect, but in pasolini's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film. this is also true of decameron.i have been given to understand there are many people who like, even admire pasolini's films. even so, i have never actually met any of them, and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me. judging him from his works alone, i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not "break the rules" so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for " existential boldness," thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker. i find his work tedious, unimpressive, and pretentious. and this, too, is true of decameron. it is also, sadly, true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure.

the tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while i was studying cinema. so imagine how i was forced to watch it in complete. believe me going through hell is much much easier. our professor told us that this is some film ???, but he never thought that we'd disagree or assume the apposite. i don't think that there is any gods on earth, we're only humans, so all the filmmakers, therefore they can make mistakes, bad movies.. or very bad too. the main problem wasn't that art, by all means, is susceptible to endless points of view, but that a lot of people just don't get it, that every single human got his own genuine taste, his own opinion, hence what i suppose it the greatest movie ever made, can also be your worst one ever, and how that is right both ways, but how many people can understand this correctly?. so my professor believes in this movie, and simply i don't. however, the only way to evaluate this "thing" is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society's mentality, imagination, and nature. to tell you the damn truth mr. pier paolo pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place. the movie is so ugly. i can't stand this, so how about analyzing it, then discovering the potential beauty in it !! it's beyond your mind hideousness, and strangely not for the sake of the movie's case or anything, it's for the sake of the unstable vision of (pasolini). his work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent. the deadly cinematic technique, the effective sense of silliness, and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious. look at the atrocious acting, the unfruitful cinematography, the awfully poor sets, .. oh my god i've got the nausea already. it can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor. there are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this. so originally, how to continue that just to review it fairly ? actually, you don't. as this very movie doesn't treat you fair at all. there is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera (!) i'm trying to connect some things like that with pasolini's end as murdered.

though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definitely incorrect assumption. this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio's 14th century "decameron" story collection.set within a medieval italian town's largely peasant population, it is a diatribe on the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time. a realistic view of life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time.given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of life, at times. or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church's rules.nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions.

yeah, i "get" pasolini and his milieu, but at the same time, i feel his "decameron" is largely overrated, and more than a little disturbing. overrated because the supposed "realism" he introduces (milling crowds, crumbling architecture, etc.) are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave. in the pursuit of realism, pasolini utilized many non-actors, but their deer-in-the-headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off-kilter and inconsistent feel. and frankly -- many of the toothless, misshapenly-featured people are painful to look at.and pasolini's "decameron" is disturbing (to me at least) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. not because i'm prudish or homophobic (i'm neither) but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo-realism he otherwise espouses, so it comes off as gratuitous and forced. one can almost hear him say "ooh--i've got to stick a cute, naked boy in this scene!" at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics, and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself, regardless of what his audience might prefer.the disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in pasolini's "decameron" struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller, rather than being an aspect of neo-realism. he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction. even the pasolini's final line of dialog in the film, which some people seem to find pithy ("why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter?") -- to me, it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way? in my opinion, a far better-crafted film (and with more homosexual content) is fellini's "satyricon". it is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its pacing, direction and strong storytelling whereas "decameron" fails by those same elements.

"scary movie 2" is a let down to the scary movie franchise. scary movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies.this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much.

scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, for there is not much of a plot , bad acting, pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. but. and this is a big but, there is one good actor, one good recurring joke, and a good beginning. the good actor being tim curry, the one good recurring joke is the creepy,weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things. and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist.the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion, but will they survive the night? this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it!

i *loved* the original scary movie. i'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. i think the wayans' are a family of comical geniuses. alas, even geniuses make mistakes.the movie begins with promise. i liked "the exorcist" parody, especially the "come on out, ma" gag. now, that's wayans-quality material. but, other than that, i can only think of two other times i laughed: 1) when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. meanwhile, he's saying, "it was just a booty call!!" that was kinda funny. 2) the "save the last dance" parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. but even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first scary movie.the rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags. jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. for example, in scary movie i, several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay. this was hilarious. but, in scary movie ii, the whole penis-strangulation scene with ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. this is the pattern of the whole film. shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far. this was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low, i have to give this one a 2 out of 10.

keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors, i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films. he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie. scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters. avoid such titles like don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood..... i know, what a title !!! obviously this film too, just anything that has keenans name in the credits.it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me on this, maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films........ 1/10.......j.d seaton

basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action/comedy. first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie (1) and the sequel had it's moments. unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver half the laughs. the humour in it is absolutely crude. if you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. when it isn't crude it's idiotic. the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic. however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend (otherwise i wouldn't have bothered). the story is undeniably thin, it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant. i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film, the laughs don't come quick enough. some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place. if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this. if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie, airplane, hotshots 1 + 2. 1/10 completely unfunny, thin storyline, a film that seems to be based on one idea (i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film?) but simply didn't have enough material.

i don't often go out of my way to write comments, but for this i had to, just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy. this doesn't come close. while the premise (change in colour/gender/whatever) is bad enough (and has been done, better, many times before)the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen. it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks. however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. as you will have guessed by now, they fail completely. i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that hollywood can provide. its appalling. add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low. and i like bad movies! avoid like the plague.

white chicks hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as black chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies? don't be a menace doesn't count, jack white and michael costanza ghost wrote that (the other norton trio members acted as directors).in white chicks, there's never really any jokes. it's just the wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. there's no setups, no punchlines and no laughs. there is a lot of "i think i'm gonna play some time crisis 3." at least for me there was (5 times to be exact).somebody has to tell kenan ivory, damon, marlon, shawn, damien (the only talented one), kim, rakeesha, george w., and osama bin wayans to stop making movies. its only hurting the o-zone layer.verdict 1/2* out of ****

i wanted so much to enjoy this movie. it moved very slowly and was just boring. if it had been on tv, it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. what happened to the story? a great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation. if this is loosely based on the life of the director, why didn't he get someone to see that the writing itself was "loose". then he directed it at a snail's pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie. the music soars, but for a different film, not this one....for soap opera saga possibly. there were times when the dialogue was not understandable when armin meuller stahl was speaking. i was not alone, because i heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. why can't hollywood make better movies? this one had the nugget of a great story, but was just poorly executed.

i enjoyed the movie very much, emotionally, intellectually, and visually. it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and doesn't need them one bit, holding my attention the entire time with the visuals, story, and interspersed words of wisdom.however: [1] some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear & understand; [2] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing (especially the f-word, which is the only reason this movie was rated r). [3] the movie is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film, except the final resolution last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] i will not recommend this movie because of 5-seconds of background narration, which did not add one bit to the side-character it applied to, or the film -- it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward: the main character's mother of german ancestry, when watching old wwii movies, "secretly roots for the germans." there would be no "local color" or art if the nazi's won the war. i don't know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi's won wwii.

as gently as i can, i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time. i did not find it the 'warm, emotionally satisfying' film others did. i found it boring, with music that distracted from the film. the story was thin, the characters overdrawn, and the direction pedestrian.fooey.now i'm going to write some more about this movie, so i make the 10 line minimum. there really isn't more to be said and brevity is important, but imdb has its minimums, so here goes.young eager kid finds nascent talent, seeks time with aging, embittered mentor in spite of father's cartoonish homophobia. aging, embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. conflict arises. while i don't think this is a spoiler, i've added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much. mostly, i just found the film boring and pretentious. a waste of my time. i honestly don't understand what little fuss there seems to be, mostly on this web site, about the transcendent quality of this movie. i think it's really worth avoiding. but, as dennis miller used to say, "maybe i'm wrong."

this movie was a major disappointment on direction, intellectual niveau, plot and in the way it dealt with its subject, painting. it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years, with appalling lack of depth though. it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.the approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as "beauty". according to the makers of this movie, 'beauty' can be only experienced in bob-ross-style kitschy landscape paintings. good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (like, primary school level) color theory and lots of sentiment. in parts the movie is offending, e.g. at a point it is stated (rather, celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' (quote).i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating, then again, so far not many people rated it, and they chose for only very high or very low grades.

there are pretty landscape shots. writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths. with lesser actors this show would be silly. 'art must uplift humanity or it's bs.' not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. the lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side. wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes. there wasn't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain. all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes. the discussions between the characters was grade school, trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted. i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here. i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with. i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie. i was moved only once towards the end. the kid was way too passive. the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. just my opinion but nowhere show for me.

i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language, and corny one-liners. minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when employed properly. however, this film is not one of those cases.take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary, sparse scenery. i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight, because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. the acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end). the scenery is drab, and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. i would call this anticlimatic, but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the "erotic" scenes... it would be untrue. i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement. apart from two or three amusing moments, this film is a waste of two hours. a tragically boring and dreary film.

i enjoy a good, slow-moving drama. christmas in august, chungking express, virgin stripped bare by her bachelors, the way home, springtime in a small town, hana bi, eat drink man woman, dolls, in the mood for love, and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films  just to name a few. unfortunately, there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves. these are what i call ian films  "incomprehensible artistic nonsense." tsai ming-liang is the king of this subgenre, and vive l'amour is his "masterpiece." in fact, this is the crème de la crème of crap-infested garbage under the guise of "art." people walk around in their apartments, drink water, stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant, hang posters, staple papers together, go to the bathroom, eat, do pushups, have sex, slap at mosquitoes, etc. i'm not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film, which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art-house trash. there is no plot, no storyline, no interesting or noteworthy events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue, and most importantly  no drama.the most eventful scene has two people "banging" on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress  ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous. the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non-existent. tsai apparently didn't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to "bang." the person under the bed is just as one-dimensional and uninteresting. he likes to drink water, makeout with melons, and stroke himself. this is tsai's idea of "character development." a truly misguided "entertainer" indeed.tsai's true contribution in vive l'amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art-house film history. he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds, only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another 356 consecutive seconds. the film then abruptly ends. no point. no entertainment. just pure, concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer. in an effort to beat a dead horse. the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom. in fact, kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo. and guess what? it's actually interesting! that film moved as slow as molasses in january, but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive l'amour. kairo is a perfect example of that.fans of cinema may thank tsai ming-liang for directing this film, as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art-house cinema can be just as poorly made as b-grade, made-for-television horror flicks. art-house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self-righteousness. the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and  gasp!  showgirls. how do you like them apples?

need i say--its a stinker! (i gave it a rating of 2)only watch it if you suffer from insomnia.there's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up, but not much else happens in this movie. there is no suspense, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the heroine's well being. a few disagreements, slight raising of voices--that's pretty much it. the secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody - the last "secret" revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point.the plot, such as it is, revolves around a young woman named faith (meg tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very, very wealthy, older widowed woman, and a growing mother/daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her.it turns out the older woman's daughter, cassandra, is dead. you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together.even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two. why he's still hanging around years after cassandra's death is a good question.there's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything--cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. everything except apparently locking the door--since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is.there's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms, and leaning forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "mounting" tension in this film--just bland, pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time.

three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt jane stanton hitchcock's novel for the tube, yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to quit. struggling artist meg tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy, enigmatic ellen burstyn, who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. after learning about the last gathering held there--ellen's daughter's coming-out party--tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began, nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another! two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn't bear close scrutiny, one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity. burstyn's role teeters on camp, while tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy-eyed-waif routine. only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. the rest is piffle.

although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl. film festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this. one -- it's an ultra-low budget canadian film. two -- it's written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's woody allen, george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). but despite my watching it with lowered expectations, it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible.in a nutshell -- bad script, bad acting, terrible directing! don't waste your time or money on this turkey. it claims to be a comedy, but i only laughed twice. plus, there is awful music blaring throughout. how this got any attention i'll never know.

this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd!!! the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on.... but the story line is like a loose cannon. if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's, poor script writing and filming. the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver. the rest of the film, could have easily been made by middle school children. i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated. my advice-don't watch it!!!

phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.its a low budget film (thats never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually i just lost interest.i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking.for something similar but better try "brother from another planet"

this has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century. it is all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below... everything. all the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.all the actors are below average, especially the main character anne fletcher (simmone mackinnon). there is a scene, where anne is asked: "why you seem so careless?" the correct answer is, because she can't act. no matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid grin in her face.it is not only the movie, which is b -quality. it is also the back cover description (at least in finland). the text mentions things like lorica gray -vessel, capital -vessel and main character garrison harper and anna (not anne) fletcher. the description sounds like a different movie, both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters

deep shock plays out like a tv movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature to be the "bad guy," and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.i checked out the movie because of the creature (i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos), and right off the bat, i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. the actors i expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). the music was typical, not-thought-out action symphonic music.i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. the movie even flowed really well, with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. but there isn't much of a story here anyways.this movie gets a 3/10 stars imo. the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming. chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video. don't bother.

watch the original with the same title from 1944! this made for tv movie, is just god-awful! although it does use (as far as i can tell) almost the same dialog, it just doesn't work! is it the acting, the poor directing? ok so it's made for tv, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much, as if you've watched it first! there are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but all are for the worse! the actors playing the parts here, just don't fit the bill! you just don't believe them and who could top edward g. robinsons performance from the original? if you want, only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave, if you watch it through! it's almost sacrilege!

it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie. that, to me and many others, is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. realizing this is simply a shortened made-for-tv film and that most people had trashed it, i didn't expect much, but you can't help but compare this with the '44 film. scene after scene, i found myself comparing what i was looking at it, and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray, barbara stanwyck, edward g. robinson and others. now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna, samantha eggar and lee j. cobb.when it was all over, i found it wasn't as bad as i had expected but it's no match for the 1944 original. the two main areas in which this made-for-tv film wasn't as good were (1) the electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. crenna and eggar were flat, and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as "walter neff" and "phyllis dietrichson," respectively.where this re-make held its own was in the other characters, such as "barton keyes" and "edward norton." cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton, head of the insurance company. it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines, etc., were all early '70s instead of mid '40s. otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed.however, one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film.

don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.i saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). they like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). the theater was almost full, and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. to tell the truth i was bored silly. it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. my daughter fell asleep half way through. also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. i haven't heard that from them since seeing the polar express, which gave my daughter nightmares.trust me, i'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. but quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.

from the creators of shrek.. ok, that grabbed my attention.well the creators of shrek also made madagascar. madagascar was half as good as shrek.and now flushed away is half as good as madagascar.that means flushed away isn't good. the animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn't.the story of this movie was only meant for kids. it's seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick.but there were many jokes meant for adults. i bet kids dint understand the jokes.despite that i dint like this flick.i am completely disappointed. 4/10

so don't even think about renting this from the shops, because this is one hell of a bad movie. you'd think that jj abrahams had written this movie. basically, a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out. fans of the completely terrible "shrek" might enjoy, but "wallace & gromit" fans will probably turn away in disgust. also, why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay? i mean, cgi animation?? for an aardman movie??!! obviously, aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing. wrong, wrong, wrong!!! nearly every single character is awful, apart from that freaky frog guy, who is just right for a movie villain. but everything else about the movie is dull, dull, dull!!! i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. no, wait, actually, i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie. it's just terrible. but thankfully, it's not as bad as "shrek."

let's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand: this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script, lame animation, and a story that's about as original as thumbtacks. don't bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. they might laugh, especially if they're off their meds. there's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort, but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing. this film, frankly, ticked me off royally. shame on you for stooping so low.

oh if only i could give this rubbish less than one star! there were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song don't worry, be happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. that is it there was nothing more amusing than that, at least not for me anyway! doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'fans of the completely terrible "shrek" might enjoy, but "wallace & gromit" fans will probably turn away in disgust.' as i loved shrek 1 2 and 3 and i also love wallace and gromit. you see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! the continuity mistakes were too big in number. some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. i won't point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see: when the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. at one point the ruby falls down roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. in the next scene roddy has caught it again. this is impossible. seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in roddy's hand. there was a third one i wanted to point out but for now i have forgotten it.too many, for want of a better word, 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole film left you wanting....wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else! paint drying or grass growing are two superb options!

ultimately too silly and pointless. yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that. forgettable. instantly.animation is, as we have come to expect, super-real. the plot-line could best be described as thin but tenacious. although the ending seemed arbitrary to me.the sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too. oh yes, and there's a romantic interest with the female being the smarter, more savvy and go-getting of the pair - this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome (anti) stereotype. probably your kids will love it though.

can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar? i mean really, animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards. or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman. whatever their reasoning, the story truly did suck.somehow, hugh jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet. yeah i know, seems stereotypical. but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london - to an extent. throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil(??) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.i would like to say something entertained me. maybe the hookup in the movie? or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. but nothing did. it had the talent, but it blew up. d-

if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars (you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel, being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel -- and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time) then this is the documentary for you. admitedly i didn't watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. maybe the rest is even better.i wonder how long it's going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies. perhaps game shows based on self-mutilation might be nice.i already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen. i don't need to see the proof on the tv masquerading as entertainment.

"the cat's meow" contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue, and some fine performances, a few of which surprised me. eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer); joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn; and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies (though why movies never use her real-life stutter is difficult to explain). but these elements don't add up to a successful whole. the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes--the meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted--but not so hard on the big picture. several minor characters don't need to be there, and don't behave consistently. the basic plot is full of illogic (e.g., why does thomas ince think it's a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesn't want to hear?), and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome. i'd like to think a trip on hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type, which isn't really accurate, and the screenwriter's ideas about chaplin and love are implausible. strangely, bogdanovich, who seemed so connected to the thirties in "paper moon", lacks a similar affinity for the twenties. he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream, which gives the party guests a very artificial look, and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period (e.g., "yes, we have no bananas"). when hearst insists everybody "charleston, charleston!" it looks as if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies, i'm sure, but not this time.

anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we're about to see can't ever be known and "this is the whisper [rumor] most often told" about one of hollywood's most sensational "mysteries."okay. so we're not getting anything new (and e!'s "mysteries & scandals" gives you a better foothold on the particular incident...and that's not much of an endorsement). what do we get?we learn that hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents. no big news there. more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and/or political establishment. it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. but what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled, we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history.the tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun. we're not empathetic with anyone. and the great "citizen kane" polishes off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way. in "the cat's meow" we're not ever sure of davies motives for being with hearst. as soon as we're told one thing, she's off doing the other.and are we to believe that davies was the love of chaplain's life? or is he just trying to cockold one of america's most powerful--and apparently moronic--citizens. the film never makes it clear.what is convincing are the production values. there's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well-known personalities in hollywood history. no one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. the disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying.the performers can't be faulted, although meg tilly goes way past parody here. kirsten dunst never disappoints. she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing. only joanna lumley rises above the material, but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it. one of her first lines is, "i'm not here!" and i'm sure she wishes she wasn't.this isn't on par with bogdanovich's trashy, so-bad-it's-good "at long last love." it's perched on attempting something serious, but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it's so full of bitterness towards "the beast" named hollywood. this is "national enquirer" filmmaking. and it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the oneida that weekend, but the audience gets pretty dirty as well.

what happened to peter bogdanovich? once a brilliant director, a trail blazer... is now scraping the very bottom... is this the same man who directed "the last picture show"? here, he takes a somewhat interesting (albeit farfetched) premise, and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite... dunst is not bad, but izzard is miscast as chaplin, and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their "looks", and not because they were right for the part. too bad. i'll go rent "paper moon" again.

kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. you can tell always she's just "acting". i like izzard though. plot is awfully boring. the viewer has no real connections to the characters, never knowing who to really sympathize with, or even care about. slow, dull movie, with some laughs, but few and not very funny anyway. plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least. you can see each plot turn coming a mile away. what is this movie supposed to be? comedy? drama? who cares? you won't by the end of this film.

just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay/ movie. the cat's meow, by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst. the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. the key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be chaplin. basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived. the story attempts to be a dark comedy, but the cat's meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. it hardly matters who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. there is not a strong character to cheer for. as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental.

anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz, 1920s dress, the charleston, and ultra-swanky yachts (e.g. me, on all counts) will want to like this movie. but the sad fact is that that's all there is. the plot is banal and obvious, the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings-on, and when the whole thing's over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke. this is a beautifully made bad movie.

...is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she's in "legally blonde." the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him. eddie izzard is pretty good, except that he's playing charlie chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for the part? hard to believe this hamfisted, uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich, but then again, he hasn't made a watchable movie in, what? 30 years? sometimes, there's just no coming back.

after seeing this film i complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. for at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. i was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the director.i was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. the music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. these days, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same.so apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss. you will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound-track and certainly not a cat's meow.

i am appalled at how bad this film is. as a pastiche of early 20th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past the moderns or (gasp) cradle will rock & i never thought i'd see a film worse than those 2. granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period. nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar.first off there's the horrible casting: eddie izzard as chaplin? excuse me? peter, did you owe this guy something? jennifer tilly as loulla parsons?? kirsten dunst as marion davies??? holy smoke, these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting.well, last picture show was a decent film, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of bogdonovitch's pics haven't been much better. guess rubbing up against welles & hitch & ford wore off a long time ago. still good for hosting tcm though.

what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is, in fact, a head-ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters (the only big actor being ginger rogers, in a very early role) all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building. these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean. as a cheap, low budget production, most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man (some guy, i don't care who he is 'cause he really sucked) talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime, while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt. honestly, i've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie of this type, and i've seen some real head-slappers.oh, and the butler didn't do it, because there wasn't a butler. but pay attention to the guy who's closest to a butler. there ya go.--polarisdib

a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions. the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house, or was it from a lover's apartment? rogers actually has two identities at the film's outset, that of miss terry, the dead victim's secretary, along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan. mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand (talbot) instead of her paper's rewrite desk, she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he's been out scooped.here's a puzzle - it's revealed during police inspector russell's (purnell pratt) investigation of harker's death that terry/morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks. why exactly was that? after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story, but before? clues are dropped regarding harker's association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building, but again, that association isn't relevant until it's all linked up to janitor peterson (harvey clark). and who's making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss, with the words "you will hear it" cut and pasted beneath? apparently, the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house's radiator system, which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims, such as mrs. coby in the apartment below harker. but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs. coby's death, he replied "apparently" to the cause of strangulation.it's these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me. the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the building's incinerator furnace! however, and score another point against continuity, we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace; she made her getaway, but how? and still pretty as a picture. and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred (arthur hoyt), who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room.sorry, but for all those reviewers who found "a shriek in the night" to be a satisfying whodunit, i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable "the usual suspects" by comparison. if you need a reason to see the film, it would be ginger rogers, but be advised, she doesn't dance.

"rival reporters pat morgan (ginger rogers) and ted rand (lyle talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. the latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. the two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.this said-to-be follow-up to "the thirteenth guest" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. ms. rogers continues to develop her skills. mr. talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. they are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very dull. the opening and closing are startling. a long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax.*** a shriek in the night (1933) albert ray ~ ginger rogers, lyle talbot, harvey clark

this was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the original. the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over-the-top histrionics of the american version. the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings. i have watched the series many times and am still enthralled.just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of "cracker". get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such delights as waking the dead, spooks, silent witness, and judge john deed. watch the original touching evil, then look for "wire in the blood" for more of the truly understated, elegant performance of robson green. hollywood needs to have a look at this actor!

this movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. however, i did not care for his mission to settle down, because i didn't care for his character. i don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him. he had absolutely no class, or charisma. he should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail. just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. does this man have any shame what-so-ever? had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring.gina gershon's character was unnecessarily british. she could've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog. now those two had chemistry! academy nominations for both stat! plot holes, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, cliché moments... what a mess of a movie.

in my lit. class we've just finished the book, hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) brian never ate worms in the book. (2) he didn't know the pilot's name. (3) his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) the man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) a thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch. and for the acting, the kid who played brian was a horrible actor. however, i do believe that the scenery was impressive, though i highly doubt the director even read the book.this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet, by gary paulsen, but if you have, then begin a complaint letter to the director.

i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear ad.the film begins with brian (jared rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a rubik's cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it. once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by ned beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue.here is where the main problem with the movie begins. by the very nature of brian's solitude, jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. as a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension. these scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story. even worse, occasionally jared  his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `predator.' speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night.another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. for instance, we are never shown how they react to news of brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on. this is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey.

this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking. jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie, thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie. the film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair. unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). furthermore, despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded.all in all, a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to, much less innocent kids.

i wish i could give this movie a zero. cheesy effects and acting. the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. lets start with the kid who plays brian. what a geek! i couldn't believe the mullet! then there was the talking to himself. i guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent, but still. of course they had to have him skinny-dipping too, not something i wanted to see. but jared gave a great performance, compared to the special effects department. everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself, and better. i seriously doubt that gary paulsen had anything to do with the production, seeing as the movie was not even called hatchet. finally, i do not think the writer had ever read the book, seeing as nothing was the same. i think the book was great, but this movie stunk like a smelly goat!

- bad stuff: this movie is real crap. bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake i thought this was "the twilight zone". the flashbacks are pretty much useless. one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better. i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting, even from the adults was horrid. a kissing scene in this movie even sucked. this movie killed the book. the book was great. i highly do not recommend this movie. not even for educational purposes. - good stuff: i don't know what i can say really. there is some suspense parts that get you going, but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting. - my verdict: do not watch.

i had never read gary paulsen's novel, hatchet, for which 'a cry in the wild' is the adaptation of, so i can't make any comparisons to the book. i will, however, say that as a film on its own, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.think of 'a cry in the wild' as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer (was quincy, california the only place this was filmed?) version of 'cast away.' jared rushton is 13-year-old brian roebson, a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father, until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain, leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.there are basically three parts to the film. the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters, namely brian and his mom. the next third of the movie (which really consumes nearly all of the film) is that of brian "roughing it." these scenes contain no particularly amazing action, nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape. nothing to put you on edge, no real encounters (except a brisk confrontation with a cub), and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first, primitive means, and then more improved ones (using tools, etc) for his survival. it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation, and that is pretty much about it. in other words, they put no meat on the paulsen's words when they translated them into a visual media.and, of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue.there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time, however. some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. however, for the most part, it is only explained in brief, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video. any minute, the singer from jefferson starship, should chime in an start singing 'sara.' other than what the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters, whether or not it really had anything to do with brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie. these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and, for me, almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more! it certainly was not, for me, a good adventure tale. but, for fans of jared rushton, it was one of the last few movies he made. so, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.

after seeing only half of the film in school back in november, today, i saw that it was on flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.the book that the film is based on, hatchet, is ok. this is a terrible adaption of it though.awful (and i mean awful) acting, bad dialogue, and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of hatchet.the film starts off brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen (sporting a mullet, banging his head to cheap 80s rock music) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged dad (his parents are divorced...now cue the dramatic pause.) now brian has said goodbye to mom and dog and is flying up to see his father. the pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man (wasn't like that in the book) who after 2 minutes in the air, has a heart attack and dies. in the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack.the plane (within another two minutes) has gone empty on fuel (leaving us, the viewers, to assume that he's been up there for hours even though the sun hasn't changed position and the scenery looks exactly the same.) now's he's crashed landed.this is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book. in the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips (looks like he just bought it), it never said he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf, and fell asleep up there on the mountain, it never said he was attacked by a bear (it said a moose but not a bear), it never said he eats the several bugs that he does, it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows, skin them, and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes (that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes) nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes.i don't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado. all it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things.my favorite part of this camp fest was brian's lame flashbacks (that are never mentioned in the book) especially the cliché scene of brian waking up, walking over to the window and seeing his dad (with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck) leaving and screams "daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddd!!!!" (yet of course his father didn't hear him even though he was just right outside) and he punches his fist through the window (wtf?) the ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (i said close.) in the book i think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to brian when he landed was "you're the kid who they've been looking for! they stopped months ago..." yet they left that line out in the movie.there's a pathetic epilogue with brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) getting back to normal with his family. i think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) then it shows his temporary home (for what, in the movie, seemed like three days, but in the book was for several months) and his hatchet, still in a tree where he left it (also didn't happen in the book) showing where he carved a message, so perfectly done: "home" (where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet?) no quote can sum this movie up better then when enid from ghost world said "this is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again." perfect description of this movie.i wouldn't recommend it to somebody (who hasn't read the book) and are just looking to watch a movie nor would i to somebody who has read the book (because they'll be disappointed and bored to death.for those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as the movie. this is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book.1/10

another big star cast, another glamour's set, another reputed director, another flick filled with songs that's topping the chart buster, but alas what's missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture. so much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before it's' red carpet premiere. a hype which went to an extent where anil kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge. well anilji, which movie were you speaking of? well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people, who have a total different stance towards life, but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem, that's love. well indeed a luring theme. but little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a multistarrer movie. these are kinda movies which i totally abhor because after spending a hefty buck for a multiplex ticket i get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax.the trouble begins right from the start. the director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets baffled as to how to share the time slot to six different star casts. some of the couples like anil kapoor-juhi and sohail khan-(whoever the female is opposite to him) just doesn't make any sense for their existence in the movie. salman (who calls himself rahul in a weird manner for the entire movie. well something like rahoooooool) again as usual tries to be extra cool with his videsi kinda hindi accent. hey sallu bhai, now that aish is getting married, at least go get some tip from abhishek to improve your acting abilities. a simple striptease wouldn't make the movie a box office hit every time. and anilji stop shaving your trade mark beard or you look totally like a eunuch. and smooching a girl of your daughters' age just looks as uncool as watching jack nicholson in a romantic movie. and please nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot.the other bigger flaw in the movie was that there wasn't any perfect synchronization between the stories of different couples. every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks, put together to form a sadistic plot of salaam-e-ishq. bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like snatch, memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline.somewhere while i was evaluating the pre-release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie wouldn't do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28, and 28 is considered a bad number in numerology. but i totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not coz of its numerology defects, but because of the myriads of flaw that persisted in the movie. and when director like nikhil advani can make such major blunders in the entire storyline of the movie, any wonder wouldn't have saved the movie from bombing at the box office.my suggestion for all you guys is, please avoid watching this movie at any cost. it isn't worth a pie that you pay for the ticket. there indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than salaam-e-ishq.

i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in november! it looked awesome and the songs! i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it! this is a film which weaves 6 couples together. it has a multi cast of 12 people! a huge amount of stars have worked on this film. i think the director, nikhil advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him. compared to nikhil's directorial debut 'kal ho naa ho' , 'salaam-e-ishq' falls quite behind. i think nikhil should have a smaller star cast. i think the best factors of this film is the songs! the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome, shankar-ehsaan-loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years. i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! one thing i was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by sohail khan and isha koppikar. i found this extremely rude watching this with family! although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents! i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall, i think its an alright movie!

i have been waiting for this movie a long time. especially because juhi chawla is in this, she's a great actress.this movie contains six stories. it's a new concept flew over from hollywood. so it's not a new item.1. khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her. but then rahul (salman khan) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend.priyanka chopra is still not a good actress. when she yells, i get annoyed. salman khan cannot play comic roles. but in his serious parts he is marvelous.2. vinay (anil kapoor) is married to seema (juhi chawla). he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman, with forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and kids.anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors / actresses. they are great. but this story is to thin for them.3. shiven (akshaye khanna) is going to get married to gia (ayesha takia), but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off.4. ashutosh (joh abraham) is married to tehzeeb (vidya balan). she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore.5. raju (govinda) is a cab driver. he meets stephani (shannon esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman. raju has to bring staphani to that man, but falls in love with her.i never liked govinda's movies. he is very annoying, not funny. but in this movie i liked him very much, like he has been growing up the last years.6. oh yes! there is sohail khan! he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati (isha koppikar). he want to get some serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between.sohail khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! i like his movies.now here's the problem. all these stories aren't interesting. to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! here and there the stories touch each other, but is not significant for the characters.my conclusion; priyanka cannot act! loose that woman in the bollywood industry. sohail khan should make more movies, this role for him was too small. salman khan cannot act comic roles, but real serious movies. that's written on his life as an actor. this movie sucks, and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor, juhi chawla, akshaya khanna and john abraham.it's just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan, and you only let him sing a lullaby.

this thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web. so i bought me a copy. well, of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments. i think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it. it was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget. but for me he surely didn't spoiled the money on props but on the make up. the make up is for that kind of flick well done. the zombies are watchable and the gore is intact. the only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule. it's terrible, luckely no hiss on the sound but sometimes it's way too dark. so you have to watch clearly to see the gore. in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish. a voice-over tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes, that tells you there is gore on the way. of course that doesn't work, made me think of cannibal girls, had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow. they had the original idea, cannibal girls was made a year earlier. don't go for the storyline, go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake. when the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra, then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on...try to do that, or am i getting a bit offline,...eat it you ugly corpses

kim basinger stars as della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute christmas shopping. after placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, she finds out the owners of the car are the rainbow coilition of villains comprising of a white guy, a mexican, a chinese guy & a black. they confront her about the note, cap a helpless security guard, and the chase is on. during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner bronson.i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller. the acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, the "why god why" bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though) it comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains della chases from/after are mind-numbingly stupid. if they hadn't had the intellect of any given "home alone" baddie, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes. the unbelievability factor i'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing "shoot em up" to the screen (a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun). this film while never attaining the heights of that film, was good in it's own rights.my grade: c- anchor bay dvd extras: commentary with writer/director susan montford and producer don murphy; a 25 and a half minute 'making-of'; a trailer & two tv spots for this film; and trailer for lower learning

ok, if you're a woman who's got aggression issues, you might like this movie. hate your significant other? this movie is for you. for the guys, it will be a bag of laughs.it's sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies.the only really good part is the last 10 seconds. even that was a load of cheese.my wife is picking the worst movies lately. this is what you get (i) for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites.

where to start...oh yea, message to the bad guys: when you first find the person you have been tracking (in order to kill) that witnessed a crime you committed, don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away. message to the victim: when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing, take that opportunity to "run away", don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear. message to the director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot, you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away! time and motion doesn't work that way. it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally kill( 4) men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home.

the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes. other than that this movie is a big dud. we have kim basinger, the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min. of the movie, which added nothing. then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve. they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her. from there this movie gets worse, way worse. i know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her. instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest. in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her. but now she turns into one tough mofu. you get the point. do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type. it's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene. it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as the consumers.

overall this movie is dreadful, and should have never been made. one of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is about to be attacked, you want to feel, "oh my god, no!", but you don't in this case, you don't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character. in the trailer, it seemed as though the movie would be great, yet there is no suspense what so ever really. there could have been maybe some mystery but there is not. "all she has is a toolbox." was said on the dvd's back, you would think that it was carefully planned this movie, and cleverly made, but it is not, the ending, was just awful, very straight forward, and pointless too. the acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower. in my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. the "special effects" and sets were average too, nothing special what so ever. there is not much gore, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. this movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing, yet really, its not even worth looking for, i do not recommend this to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, by a few fights and a boring story.

i can't believe the likes of guillermo del toro and kim bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage! the script is so poorly written and the directing so weak (both by the same person) that its hard to find more one-dimension characters in a film. the dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre. the setup it's tricky, inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film. bassinger's character is so dumb, that she actually stops to scream to god "where are you!" so the people after her can follow, and then takes a leak!!!! and then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, i mean, she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her, and this happens in the middle of the night. it really makes me wonder, is that really the best writing people in hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it.

a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio. to say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts i'd ever read would be a bold understatement. yet i never told him this. why? because in a world where films like "while she was out" can be green-lighted and attract an oscar- winning star like kim basinger, a screenplay lacking in character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell.as so many other reviewers have pointed out, "while she was out" is a dreadfully under-written woman-in-peril film that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on christmas eve. every gripe is legitimate, from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic, but basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. here are a couple of things that struck me:1) i don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves?2) racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen.3) sure the film is stupid. but so are the countless "thrillers" i've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism. stupid or not, i found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors.4) i loved the ending! 5) though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase, i really do think this film should be retitled "the red toolbox of doom."

i don't often give one star reviews, but the computer won't let me do negative numbers.the opening titles tell us we're in deep water already. although this is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 producers credited. no. no.at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community. the house is a pigsty. his wife, della (kim basinger) has let the children run amok all day.ok. we're already in deep water. ms. basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. uh, are these her children or grandchildren? it's christmas eve. della drives to the mall, a lengthy scene that could have been cut. to bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on christmas eve. sure. for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it.we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes, though. it's raining and traffic is bad. first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time. then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone.she wanders the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke, but that's too complicated for the script to follow.in the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films. one white boy (lukas hass watching his career go down the toilet), one black, one asian, and one hispanic. imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and you'll have the idea.although they have a gun she gives them attitude. a mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head, firing more than once. the parking lot is crowded as can be, people everywhere, and nobody notices.della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area, she drives to a construction site, where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally) at hand.major spoiler ahead.she drives back home. the car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. checks on the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range.the experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for della. instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home, because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges. the four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense. the husband, different story.i'm so glad i saw this on cable. if i'd seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) i'd have been furious. as is, i'm just sad seeing talents like ms. basinger and mr. haas waste themselves on garbage like this.one very good thing, though. this was written and directed by susan montford. ms. montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd. there is justice in the world.

the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one. the big problem is implausability. i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable. i find that the more i watch this kind of movie, the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger. continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid. if they took the time to make it more realistic, i might have enjoyed it a little. having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.

its christmas eve and lazy and submissive housewife della (kim basinger) receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband. leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall. its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible, della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces, she leaves them a note saying as much. returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs, yup the owners of the car she left a note on, they are very angry and want some fun with her, a kindly security guard steps into assist her, but things get out of hand and the guard is shot, della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit, they shoot at her, she looses control of her car and crashes, quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk, she hides in a deserted building site, but is soon caught, just before they try to rape and kill her, from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench, wounding their leader "chuckie", she manages to escape again into the nearby woods, in the fracas one of the gang is killed, it just happens to be the black guy here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues. a similar plot line to eden lake drew me to this, but that is where the comparisons end. this is a brainless and dumb film, shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved, the doe eyed disney-esquire twin kids are horrible to watch, but its lukas haas as chuckie, that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department, although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband. as a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through, even in the set up early on della's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its christmas eve, now where could they be going with this i wonder??? the only surprising part of this $hit is when after killing all the clichéd bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox, she demands chuckie to f@ck her, if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness, it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor. even the ending is messed up, all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed.. i didn't think i could be further disappointed, but then i saw that guillermo del toro produced this dreck

so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to? mmm to tell the truth the film's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic, but simplicity can have its strengths. anyhow by the end of 'while she was out' i was left feeling rather indifferent. not the worse (despite being engulfed by negatives), but there's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm, but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid, when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.the problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material (taken from a short story), along with the very variable performances. the flimsy script was poorly thought-out (which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off), so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. as for the bunch of stereotypical goons (led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon) terrorizing basinger, well they were less than threatening, but hopelessly clueless. watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand (don't ask me why?) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn't elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. basinger's performance is stout-like, but doesn't craft much empathy. craig sheffer shows up as her hot-headed husband. strangely i couldn't keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic (why would she be constantly carrying it) and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing. watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty, due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.susan montford's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy, as it pretty much chugs along. i liked the opening credits though, with its hauntingly sullen score (which is the most effective thing throughout the feature) and polished photography.no great shakes. doesn't ask much of your time, but i wouldn't care to see it again. however with the inclusion of a joy division song, it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen.

first of all, really kim basinger? your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful, most likely paid in cash for home, and you can't even put on a decent shirt? i'm a woman, and yes, i'm going to come right out say it--clean something, starting with your hair. and while you're at it, it's christmas eve. buy your kids some presents...or at least a christmas tree. don't drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall, park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in, and simply buy wrapping paper. also, the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note, don't sign your name. i refuse to feel sorry for della. obviously, due to the fact that kim basinger is this masterpiece's executive producer, she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman. we get it. alec baldwin is a jerk, but seriously, don't model horrible films after your own life. also, you're in you 50s. you definitely wouldn't have 8 year old twins. and those names? terry and tammy. way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves. it's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a "girl"...obviously ms. basinger had some say about what goes in the script. it's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back. apparently, della's magical ninja skills are impossible to beat. her driving skills are pretty nifty too. this film is so cliché, it hurts. wahhhhh! they spelled your name wrong on the tea cup. or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you're at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint. or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at. boohooo! the fact that she refuses to take off that bright trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point--this woman is a moron. who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car, but not their purse, full of identifying artifacts such as your address. i have never wanted the "bad guys" to succeed as much as when i watched this film. and did anyone else happen to catch the "african american" shirt the black guy was sporting? oh yes, rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet. don't waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life. instead, go do what della couldn't figure out how to do...take care of your kids, and maybe brush your hair. that powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive. singing "i'll be home for christmas" in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets. thanks della!

she may have an oscar and a golden globe, but this film shows why she also is a perennial razzie nominee. to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money. she could do ads on why you shouldn't talk on a cell phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded mall.susan montford should stick to producing (shoot 'em up ) as she is not very good as a writer/director.she is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun. what does she do? she starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something. she manages to get away, but gets lost in the forest after crashing. why didn't she run to someones house? we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox. of course, their guns are no match for her wrench. ha! of course, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. those poor thugs.now, she's home for christmas - and she brought a gun!

i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie,romantic interest or damsel in danger.but,everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l.a. confidential,and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance.however,after that moment,her career did not follow the ideal path.sure,the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like people i know or the door in the floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character.the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty,but also that the movie is really crappy.the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic.however,basinger brings some conviction to her character,and that makes this poor movie to win a few points.this movie is full of clichés and generic villains.the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly,because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone.the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.i do not recommend while she was out at all.this film commits the capital sin of being boring.

della myers (kim basinger) is an upper-class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband kenneth (craig sheffer). della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting kenneth. on the christmas eve, she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts, and she does not find any parking space available. when she sees an old car parked on two spots, she leaves a message to the owner calling him "selfish jerk". when the mall closes, della's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  chuckie (lukas haas), the afro-american huey (jamie starr), the chinese-american vingh (leonard wu) and the latin tomás (luis chávez). when the security guard of the mall protects her, he is shot on the head by chuckie, della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals. however she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang. she takes the toolbox and hides in the wood, fighting against the gang to survive.a couple of days ago, i saw the trailer of "while she was out" and i was anxious to watch the dvd. unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés. della myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family. she is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the batman's utility belt. therefore, the plot is so absurd that irritates. the gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of american movies, with an afro-american, a chinese-american and a latin together with an american lord to be politically correct. kim basinger has a decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five year-old woman. my vote is four.title (brazil): "enquanto ela está fora" ("while she was out")

it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this "movie." no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing. she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career. this is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.the fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of logic.**after she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her. tell me, what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? i don't mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back. but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level. no woman would do that unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them. none of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged. and by the way, when the security guard approached, as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger, why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream?? **when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes. she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. i understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should've ran.(i didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because i loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on it).**why would she carry a loud, red toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? when she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox. first she resists, then eventually opens it. and takes out a wrench. this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie. when asked to open the box, she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch/push/open/manipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical/shoot him in the face/render him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all along. it feels like that's what they tried to do with kim basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugs.**throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackers.**when she was running away, how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were? i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude. she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from them.**finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her. how ridiculous. as one of the thugs even said, they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate. even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?

oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace.i am not usually this critical about any movie, cause every person has his/her style. but this movie, however, was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and i think it should stay like this, for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke.i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay far away from this one.

well, it turned out as i expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! the 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense (hell, does anyone understand that word these days?). in this burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!), but what's wrong?first, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of hollywood-human traits. i refer especially to ari and the slave-trader. these traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions. it makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.second, the humans talk. of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that dr. zira has in him (so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since capt. davidson has to play the hollywood-let's-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. oh my god, will they never learn? i new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! they were in need of a hero! and then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! but it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape-hater like charlton heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society, where heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. the second, battle-part comes as an anti-climax. that's because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot. nice try, but the chill you feel when davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.fifth: the ending!!! for chrissakes, who came up with that?! (a) davidson crashes twice with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? come on, who'd believe that? if the pods are really small space crafts (davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? and what about that ending???? i mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. but here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (there's a thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? how come? did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before davidson's mission took off? why is thade worshiped? stupid stupid stupid.helena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but i'd expected no less. i preferred her ape above estella warren as a human, but maybe i got some loose wire in my head. nevertheless, the only convincing apes were tim roth as thade (wonderful!) and ari's household ape (the ex-general, but i forgot his name).nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. it was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. don't stylize everything...

i really looked forward to see planet of the apes, but it was a huge dissapointment.the settings and masks are great, but that is the only good aspect of the film. all other things are really annoying. mark wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. the other actors are also not very good.but the worst point of all, is the story. it is absolutely ridiculous! for example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! this is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.

what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. they would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth, his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.and alas, the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. and the "haha, we're so clever, aren't we?" way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one. sigh...instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'ed wood', 'edward scissorhands', 'batman', or even to a lesser extent 'sleepy hollow', and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.

i had very low expectations for this alleged "re-imagining" of the original -- and they weren't even met! what were they thinking? (answer: they weren't.) please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest. clip your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything besides watch this. remember: if you rent stuff like this, it will only ensure they make more.

this tim burton remake of the original "planet of the apes" from 1968 (and starring charleton heston) is a far, far cry from the quality and plot of the original.certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. the characters were boring and the dialog was awful. i sat through the entire film with a friend (who thankfully only rented it) and completely understood why, before christmas, all of the "planet of the apes" toys at target were in the clearance bin.my advice to tim burton: don't put this on your resume.my advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 "planet of the apes" movie.

being a big fan of the "other" planet of the apes films, i rented this dvd despite my aversion to all things tim burton. once again, he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. even the ape makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. mark wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if boogie nights wasn't proof enough). i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter. no doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche-ridden screenplay. i rented this dvd on a special $1 night and i still feel ripped off.

i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. for one thing, it was directed by tim burton. another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. i found it boring, gross, and ridiculous. if you've seen it, you know what i mean. just about everyone at imdb say it's crap and boy, are they right! if you haven't, avoid it. it's a snorer. 1 out of 10.

this is the worst movie i have seen for years! it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. i thnik when is something going to happen in this film,,,, and the the acting is worse. the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop. mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks.

while watching this piece of crap! the day after, i saw a 1min trailer - that one minute included all, all what was at least not boring to watch...so don't waste money or time on this one, get the original, it's much better though the effects might not be up to date...

this movie was 100% boring, i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater. it wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either, it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie, god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that

this is a bit of a first for me, the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film. pota isn't a bad film (great sets, costumes and the odd great performance) but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director. the pacing was very odd, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end, by myself and the cast. tim roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. come back tim.

absolutely the worst film yet by burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film. this is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out "he's lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everybody know. carter is really awful and so is wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing. very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman. heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie. very poor results.if anyone else out there also saw "sleepy hollow", they will probably have noticed, as i have, the declining quality of burton's films. i've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films. in "sleepy hollow", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (chris lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know). the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. "planet of the apes" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like "total recall" or "tango and cash" than like sci-fi. he's also fallen into the rut of so many other "big" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. word to burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in "mars attacks" or "beetlejuice") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.

apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is. at one point in this film, someone (i believe pacino's producer) warns him that film is getting off track, that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii. instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout. some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al (was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare's birthplace, other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there?), and, before the film has really even begun, we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera. i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act - but apparently it's how al really behaves in person.enough rambling. here's a shotgun smattering of why i didn't even make it 3/4 of the way through this: 1) pretentious - al always knows when the camera is on him, whether he's acting as richard or in a 'real' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes, also, some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme. if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside, it's unbearable. "look at me, chewing all the scenery!" 2) winona ryder. when she appears as lady anne, this film comes to a screeching halt, which it never recovers from. she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes. her performance is dreadful, to boot. 3) the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture. of course, you also learn that pacino shouldn't be directing films (or doing richard in the first place). i'd rather watch bobby deerfield than this.lastly, read the play and learn it for yourself. go out and see it performed. in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater, and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama (except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence! my god! was that necessary?!)it's all just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying nada.

it seems that salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and i say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. i'd say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. on the whole, a b-movie, hardly worth your money... vote: 4/10

this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot. in summary: the oil business is in cahoots with the government (or gummint if you prefer), the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots, and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way. the only people that get done over are the good ones, like mr clooney ("bob"). oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . that really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators.in syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again 2. people like clooney and hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script 3. if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see claude chabrol's "l'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted. empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length.

considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched. there was no real advancement of anything. character development, minimal. plot advancement, maybe. enjoyment, none. i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. in summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.

spoilers i guess. the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie. i just couldn't get over it. and what is wrong with mark wahlberg's character? if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes, i'd be all like, " aaaahhhhhhh!!! run for your lives! the monkeys have inherited the earth!" but he's all like, "talking apes, okay. next?" that's pretty jaded i'd say. he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis. besides that, this is rick baker's best work yet. this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field. 3/10.

we gave up at the point where george clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. we were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. to say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! how did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an oscar? clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. what was he thinking? oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? the film was hard enough to follow without that as well. i pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.

contrary to most other comments about "syriana" on the imdb web-site, i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space.in short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so "story-lines" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. no, sir, it does not. what does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.this kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.thank goodness, then, for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again.

not good! rent or buy the original! watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then....maybe.it is like claiming an elvis actor is as good as the real king.

this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. it was sort of a remake but then again, not really. i was very disappointed considering the tools that tim burton has at his disposal. he had great make up and cgi available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? heck no. so in that regard, the film fails.at least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. and, by the way, if you give it some thought, and i did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about it.this film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of "beneath the planet of the apes". here's how i would have written it:an astronaut (it really should have been more than marky mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so i would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. sadly, tim burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. consider what he did with the batman series. he's a rotten director inspite what of people think. he's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. sorry, but no. if anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.

mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke. you have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song "suzanne" being played over and over throughout the movie until when "the second coming of suzanne" is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing.this off-the-wall armature movie maker logan,jared martin, is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project. planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne, sandra locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: jesus christ.with logan's assistant and all around gofer clavius, richard dreyfuss,somehow getting a $740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance logan's masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film. this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon, paul sand, but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out.the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub-plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy, kari avalos, who's cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else, at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to,failed. it's not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she, like jesus, could miraculously heal the sick?there's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair, gene barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical-like vision that changed his life forever. sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world, like this movie that he's in, and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne. sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david, mark rasmusser, who's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast.the movie "the second coming of suzanne" goes on with a number of unrelated sequences, probably to fill or pad in some time by it's director and film editor, and then goes to it's final scene in a christ-like crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling. it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate, on the helpless and tied up suzanne, the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2,000 years ago.hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow "the second coming of suzanne" puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film. the movie tries to be arty but that's just an excuse to cover up it's brainless and non-existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it.

this dreadful film assembles every asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package. money grubbing, devious japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman pat morita to recover industrial secrets in detroit. here he encounters a down at heel jay leno, who promptly refers to a murder victim as a jap and calls morita tojo. it's all downhill from there.

this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. he is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. and seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. in addition, i have a feeling that pat morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese. don't even get me started about the story. i give it a 2 out of 10.

this movie is awful. i haven't laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time. leno should've stuck to stand up and late night tv. the cars in the movie were cool, but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie i've ever seen. it's pathetic, the acting is horrible, and the plot could've been written by a 4 year old. don't get me wrong, jay leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!

there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film. it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time. the acting is horrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film. "a buddy film," "an action/comedy," "mystery." seems half way through, he gives up, and is just along for the ride. jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers. it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie. jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this, had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit. mr. morita had already been a star in his own right, acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as "happy days," and the dismal but affable "mr. t and tina." and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film, "midway," "the karate kid," and a host of others. mr. leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s. and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america. he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films. it is a shame, that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.

collusion course is even worse than the typical "evil white male corporate capitalist" movie of the week. this movie is less pleasant than a toothache. jay leno can act. he's good in his underrated debut movie, the silverbears, in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character. this movie is so bad leno's character, a sanctimonious buffoon, is less annoying than morita's character, a sanctimonious fool.

the novelty of hearing clean-cut jay leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper. in collision course, the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late pat morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car lover leno played a hand in the plot?). the two leads try hard, they really do, but leno is no actor and morita's fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry. the film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal, but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time. fans of leno's considerable comedic talents will feel let down; everyone else will just be bored.

went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4. unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it. the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks.too cartoonish and very disappointing.

i was very disappointed in this movie. plotwise it was weak bordering on silly: souls who can affect reality in the way they do? a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? and the whole b-story with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television, "why are you wasting my time with this?"thematically, "river of souls" didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode "soul hunter" did. we see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still don't get a feeling for their culture. (are there any female soul hunters?)the acting was okay, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive. but overall, i'd say give this one a miss.

i'm a big fan of b5, having caught on only at the end of season three. i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought out story arcs to ever hit television. even the filler episodes were interesting. the movies, also, were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.which brings us to 'river of souls'. naturally, after seeing everything else, i had high expectations. martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci-fi story. the story itself, might have looked good in outline form, even made it to the story board. however, it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie. there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out. had this made the regular season, it would have rated among the worst of the episodes.

before this made for tv movie began, i had relatively low expectations. that's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone. there is no president sheridan, delenn, lennier, londo, vir, g'kar or lyta. if you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except zack, vir and captain lockley left b-5 permanently. now for this film they did bring back garibaldi (who was not in the last b-5 movie) to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. but because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped.the movie is about a soul hunter (martin sheen) who is led to babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (ian mcshane). a lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly i felt like it was a case of "been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past".the secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. this was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking.by the way, sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunter--with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. however, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. this should have been spotted and corrected.so the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard b-5 nuts (like myself). others seeing it might assume the series sucked--which is a great injustice. this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit.

"grey matter" aka "the brain machine" but the video people thought better of that; the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977; it's that kind of movie. the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine' project that has drafted four people - who turn out to be, roughly, a philosopher, a horny priest, a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts. in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies. here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; my s*** has better production values than this. it held my interest, though, just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing, dabbling in four-guys-in-a-room character drama. the answer: a tract about how science is inferior to god. thanks a lot. it's like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle. the priest is played by james "roscoe p. coltrane" best, the philosopher by gerald "the republican simon" mcraney. also featuring very, very, very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity, this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention.

i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious. this movie went nowhere fast. what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, a picture of some dude's swimming pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing its job, and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating "t minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting is going to happen. it doesn't so don't get your hopes up. the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc, in something other than there famous tv personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good. and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. this movie is as close as i have given a one yet, but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn't have to leave in the middle. avoid at all costs.

"the brain machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about. four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but it seems he's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. good call there on the senator's part. there's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on, who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the general or 'the project'. too bad he wasn't more effective, he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.if nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones, room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit. perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title - "time warp"; nothing else would make any sense. as for myself, i'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr. krisner's experiment titled 'group stress project'. it applies to the film's actors and viewers alike.keep an eye out just above the general's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.you may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard gerald mcraney fan, could he have ever been that young? james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but don't call him father. for something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's "the killer shrews". that one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously.

you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles. generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets. such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles.its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves, or something like that. its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense.its a turkey of the untastey kind. avoid it.

this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. but for me, it failed. i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it.but it didn't work for me. i found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. i don't think that this is the case here.as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...i see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "action". and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one.

let's see, here are the "highlights" of the brain machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977. that's an easy one to explain. this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-watergate mood of distrust in government. after seeing the brain machine now, my only wonder is that it ever got released at all!

i bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title "grey matter". the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non-dukesofhazzard role intrigued me. as the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.and yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it. some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. it's actually kinda funny. after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "grey matter".i also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling. at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a "scientific b*tch!". it's just a very inadequate insult. several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that "scientific b**tard!". it just sounded very awkward to me.someday this movie will disappear forever. another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it. almost like it never happened.

ouch, what a painfully boring sci-fi movie! and that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! during the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files. as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed. figures from then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing. more like dull, pointless and vague. scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway. they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed; yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device. perhaps i missed something, but i doubt it. the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities. so basically, "the brain machine" just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room. the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings! the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five-second shot of the places. either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci-fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves. staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying, i assure you. james best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent, but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time. avoid!

oh, my gosh...i thought cbs primetime television shows were theworst things gerald mcraney appeared in...four people are experimented on by a crazed mind controlcomputer. that's it, don't rent it.i saw this under one of its many titles- "grey matter," and it isperhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. the otherreviews are right, it is awful. never have so many establishingshots appeared onscreen, never. the cast is awful, the directionis awful, and the script is awful. i cannot stress how awful this is. avoid it like you would smallpox.this is rated (pg) for physical violence, some gun violence, mildgore, some profanity, and some adult situations

the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there obviously are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black robes and belly dancers. i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture. the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible. the original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this movie.

this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the plot is awful, and the acting is worse. the jokes that are attempted absolutley suck. don't bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this. and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie, don't watch it with your parents.

this may very well be the worst movie i'll see if i live to be 100. i think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this. i'm dumber for having watched it, and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film.and after i finally turned it off, i actually had the urge to vomit.no one had a clue about photography when made this. no one had a clue about acting. no one had a clue about just about anything.i can't believe f/x shows this crap on occasion. the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz! channels - not even the main one. and it was on at about 3 a.m. at that.

this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly, just painfully mediocre. lacking any real wit or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the `jokes' (which are predictable and threadbare) are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer. another notch to mark the sad decline of john waters and a reminder that what `shocked' or amused us 30 years ago doesn't work quite the same way now. we've seen it all before, and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated. a major miss.

whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies.a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family. the movie is filled with idiots and includes live "teabagging". that should sum it all up for you.do not waste your time. you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on - it doesn't!

the only saving grace of this movie is that it serves as the 0 end of the movie rating scale. now if i see a movie that really stinks i say this movie was a real pecker. i believe this movie is a perfect example of christina ricci's one dimensional acting. horrible

i saw this movie at sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description i was excited to see it. supposedly a "mockumentary" of two high school students making a documentary of high school life, it featured bad acting, bad directing, completely lack of engaging characters as written, and all-around is a total bust. i love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. the characters are one-dimensional and self-consciously "cool" although they are supposed to be outcasts. you get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on-purposely-bad movie to show their friends, yet somehow it got into sundance. mystifying.

...was so that i could, in good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is. i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself,"wow, this is pretty bad.". and, to be honest, i would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for esai morales (though he had very little screen time). he's the movie's only well-acted role, which is a shame because i really like gil bellows...or at least i thought i did.while watching this i started thinking back to his part in "shawshank redemption" and realized it wasn't as good as i thought it was. problem: his jail-house/tough guy act seems like it's just that, an act; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression. has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to? i doubt it, but maybe he should have.and, to make matters worse, they've managed to inject a little jail-house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived, especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a "rasta" who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural.i wouldn't normally slam a movie like this, but when i saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review. i felt like i was cheated and lied to, and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie.i say boooooooo.

all the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. i feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. this was one of the worst movies i saw in months. every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. and the end? it's an open ending... why? because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. this movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you'll be scared. when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told (a bit to loud) him that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange at me. these day i could make an oscar with a home-video of my goldfish, if only i use the right marketing.

imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about "the grudge." so, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. it is the halloween season, after all. and it did boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good...so you go.and you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does, and you hear yourself audibly saying, "that can't be the end of the movie...." but, alas, it is. and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie. you think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. i see no future for miss gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future. actually, it won't be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough, if you ask me. horrible, horrible, horrible. the plot didn't make sense; continuity was terrible. it's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a "grudge ii--the return of 'cat-boy'."

if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre, the director, the producer, the actors and the person that told you to go see it! shame on you, sarah michelle geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in english. i wanted to boo when the movie ended...a true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie...she just practiced her frowning skills. don't waste your time or money on this film.

gee, what a crappy movie this was! i cannot understand what people find so scary about "the grudge". the director plays one trick (i'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. to conclude, i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor "the ring" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for "the grudge" is a waste of money.

wow, what a total let down! the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous. the special effects were a direct rip-off of "the ring." the story? was there one? not in my opinion..just a bunch of flashy imaging. the entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. however, this is the worst horror film i have seen in years. and that buffy chick? well, she's a bad actress! as plastic as barbie and just as talented..no, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of barbie! i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg-13, and had it been rated r, it would have bombed imo! stupid movie!

this movie was horrible. i could barely stay awake through it. i would never see this movie again if i were payed to. the so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 i payed to see it. don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movie. horrible movie, no need to ever see it.

this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms. it's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like "the ring") take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out, two-dimensional excuses for human characters.this english-language version of "the grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you ought to be living on.not recommended.

okay, if you've seen the ring, you've basically seen the grudge. it's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. the plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for instance, how would the care center have known that yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? and it's not really clear what bill pullman's character had to do with anything. he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. it didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more.

my husband and i went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back. i was so disappointed. the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. i found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers, i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us. my advice: if you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.

this movie may seem scary on commercials, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. this is a below below average, (even lower than that) and has no plot. i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you, but so what? make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair (dead japanese woman). can you say "horrible rip-off of samara (the ring)"? don't get me started with the "dead child". not even that scary! so what? he has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge! 1/10! yuck! >.<

ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with. now living in america especially during this election i see some very deceiving things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list. i don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best. oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. how does that scare someone? i can make that noise easily. now don't get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.

i hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case i feel like i have to: the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. there, i said it. and now that i have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why."when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. the curse gathers in that place of death. those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury." that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing. unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. those who encounter the "curse" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. you want more? well too bad. some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you. the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. director takashi shimizu, pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. it pretty much unfolds like this:-person walks into house-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard -person goes to investigate-sound starts to get loud-person sees a ghost-loud scream and/or cat screech-cut to blackbefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. the first time was actually somewhat creepy. each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. by the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end "with a loud scream and a cut to black." we were never proved wrong.the film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. i have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. i haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander 2. and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?obviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made $15 million its first weekend, the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. the scariest things about the grudge are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the "scariest movie ever made." i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge?

i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he's made on dvd except for hotel room & the 2 hour twin peaks movie. so, when i found out about this, i immediately grabbed it and...and...what is this? it's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. maybe i don't know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks, too. let me make it clear that i didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity. i highly recommend you don't spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.

lynch. the man has some really great stuff! he knows how to disturb us, then reward us by getting us think in different ways. this, however, is altogether different. dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. i may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast-forward. didn't miss a thing. i felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. it's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded out with annoying animation, voices and sound. but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile.

i'm somewhat of a fan of lynche's work, so i was excited when i found this dvd. unfortunately, i was very let down. it's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor. the animation is very crude, no doubt done using macromedia. each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows. for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed by it. however, if you've spent much time on newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before. many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd. if lynch submitted this work to the website, then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists. but, since i saw this on dvd, instead of on newgrounds, i give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as i would have otherwise. these cartoons are fit for the internet, but with a name like david lynch on it, i expected better quality both in story and in animation.

in film, i feel as though it should be more than just art. i think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one. i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. it is good film-making but there really isn't anything else to it. as i've said before, i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don't see a need for it at all. this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he's still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. if you like lynch, check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much.

david lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families. the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth-hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises, the son and mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series.lynch is not famous for his comedies (i.e. on the air, aspects of wild at heart), and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general. however, there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud. there are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in dumbland).i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disturbing, animated comedy here. interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-brow humor (i.e. most will farrell films) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross-out humor. while the blend doesn't really work very well here, it is nothing if not lynchian.worth seeing by lynch fans.

let's be honest here: the only reason anyone bought this, the only reason anyone reviewed this, and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch's children. but guess what? even david lynch can produce a piece of crap.maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in-itself as a pure subject-of-knowing. maybe the atrocious, cacophonist sounds, and chicken-scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity's place in the world, about our relation to the real, about the absurdity of it all.instead, it just says one thing to me: i just lost $20.if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive, i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed. if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd, i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutes.there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland -- it is meta, meta funny. that is, it is so bad that it isn't even funny because it's so bad. this fact, however, is a little funny.if you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy dumbland. if not, spare yourself the agony.

a vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated (including women). released to theaters just prior to "a star is born", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring kris kristofferson is wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. filmed in simi valley, ca, the results are truly unseemly, with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director george armitage's script. armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including jan-michael vincent, victoria principal, bernadette peters, and, in a bit, loni anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is kristofferson, who is gruff and rude throughout. it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like an ugly stain. *1/2 from ****

you wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good, and it isn't. it's a no budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. there is no plot to be seen. the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i've ever seen. it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. it's a funny and sickening film, and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie.my rating: bomb/****. 90 mins.

a terrible amateur movie director (no, not todd sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. the friend and sister fall in and get rescued. meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. whatever the heck that means. this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. the humor is painfully unfunny, the "action" merely sad. now i've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away fast!!my grade: f

wow, this was a very bad movie... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result.the editing of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening.all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything.the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this.unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find, do not watch this. period.

and a 30,000$ budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50$. you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot, he was just happy to be making a zombie movie. what the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies. it could have been great if he just had of given a care. the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays over it.what happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work, and one idiot behind the camera.

ok, i really don't have too much to say about this film, other than this: i have seen over 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2,300 of those were horror films. while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best (as opposed to my favourite, which i can tell you is george a. romero's dawn of the dead), i can tell you without the slightest hesitation that todd sheets' zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seen.there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film. the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the make-up, the music... every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released.even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist, please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage. there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this. you won't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display... trust me. please.

i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with 'zombie bloodbath' as one of it's alternative titles. perversely, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! this film is pretty bad too; obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself 'zombie bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display...but it all feels very old and tired, which isn't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line. it's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc. the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you're in for; low quality zombie garbage. there's plenty of gore in the film, and it's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring. zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too, and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers! the main influence seemed to be romero's superior day of the dead, although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore. it all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i can't say i was impressed with it!

i watched the malayalam movie "boeing boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name) long back. the basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way, the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience)... i haven't seen the english original. but had really enjoyed the malayalam film (made by priyadarshan himself)which was a side splitting comedy, back then. of course the acting by mohanlal,mukesh and sukumari (who did the cook's role) was so natural and spontaneous.probably, i am too smitten by the malayalam film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake. but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have overacted. paresh rawal has done a decent job - but doesn't reach anywhere near sukumari.but all in all its ok, if one compares it to other recent hindi comedy movies.

the first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick, a lame reason for akshey kumar to date 3 girls, very loud over acting by both akshey and john abraham. neha dupia was the highlight of the movie, paresh rawal did well but not as good as his performance in hera pheri. overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, watch hera pheri and hungama again!summarising it: a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by preetam the man who bought us dhoom! keep it up! movie shot all in one room, new comers (female cast) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like akshey and john totally disappointed an established director like priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!

probably the worst bollywood film i've seen.no plot line. very little character developments.full of silly and pointless humor. the whole film was chaotic and direction-less. there was no proper ending to the story. the airport was filmed in a shopping mall. same story chewed over and over again until you want to say "please, just move on with it!!" even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these days.btw i'm not from an indian background2/10

having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 christmases, i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr. seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. first off, following a classic act like chuck jones' animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas. jim carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch. as characterised by boris karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. there is no method to carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here. why, universal, why? i mean , i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman michael caine), but this one needs to be filed under "films that should never have been made." this does not bode well for the cat in the hat, an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas. i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the tv special. this is 2 hours you can never, ever get back.

(possible spoilers)someone once asked dr. seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas. he turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous chuck jones tv special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's the 5,000 fingers of dr. t). when the good dr. died in 1991, his widow, audrey geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. but with the commonplace use of cgi effects becoming a reality, mrs. geisel had a change of heart. universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of jim carrey as the title character. supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. well, mrs. geisel, that makes one of us.the film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even heaven's gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what jeffrey price and peter s. seaman (scribes of who framed roger rabbit?, which made much betteruse of a high budget) turned in. whereas the tv special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the grinch. it turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one christmas at the age of eight. so it turns out that everything that ails our poor mr. grinch is directly because of the whos. trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. that might not seem so bad if only the grinch were a little more...well, grinchy. the character that dr. seuss wrote and chuck jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. carrey's grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `cheermeister,' trashes the whoville town square in anger(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). this undermines the script's attempt to make the grinch more sympathetic, with all the whos down in whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).the whoville of dr. seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of christmas. the whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on american consumerism. this is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from american consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.the film also expands and redefines the character of cindy lou who, a small but crucial character in the original. the innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the whos and trying to understand the grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.those who celebrate christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of december 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. it proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. the folks at universal should get down on their collective knees and thank god that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. furthermore it made mike myers' the cat in the hat possible!

how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, i never did see the reason for a remake. not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch. i mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the grinch? it just didn't make any sense to me. his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. the whole story of the grinch and cindy lou-who was over done and wasn't needed. they actually just destroyed the story, period.all the who's in whoville are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. but cindy lou-who is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a christmas as the other who's. he kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the who's what his version of christmas is all about. but soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of christmas.how the grinch stole christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that how the grinch stole christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry. but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmas.1/10

i thought "what's new scooby-doo" was pretty bad (yes, i'm sorry to say i didn't like it), since hanna-barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. when i heard "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue" was in the works, i thought it could be better. but when i saw a pic of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear, i knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. i watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another "teen titans" or "loonatics unleashed"-wannabe. no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. shaggy and scooby-doo have become more brave, too. also, since shaggy is not going to be a vegetarian in this series, casey kasem (whom actually is a vegetarian), the original voice of shaggy, will not voice shaggy. he will only voice shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the internet jokes weren't enough. so scott menville (whom previously voiced red herring on "a pup named scooby-doo") voices shaggy here. believe me, the voice is really bad! it makes shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. however, kasem does voice shaggy's uncle albert, which is a sort of good thing. scooby-doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scooby-doo from the live-action movies. also, scooby's frank welker voice (need i mention brain the dog again?) still hasn't improved. robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than scrappy-doo! he tries to be funny and does "comical" impressions and gives safety tips ("remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!"), but it just doesn't fit into a scooby-doo cartoon. again, the hanna-barbera sound effects are rarely used here. however, on one episode, "lightning strikes twice," they use the "castle thunder" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (although they do still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) scooby-doo hasn't use "castle thunder" sound effects since 1991. but my question is, why use "castle thunder" on "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue," while not use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on "what's new scooby-doo!" (two episodes of wnsd used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) if wnsd and the dtv movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. the day this show premiered, i watched the first episode, and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes! to get my mind off of this poor show, i rented "scooby-doo, pirates ahoy!" which came out around the same time. and you know what? the "pirates ahoy" movie was actually better than "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue" (and even better than "what's new, scooby-doo!") and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. the direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. but, whether you loved or hated "what's new scooby-doo," i don't recommend it. but if you hate the old series, then you'll love it! (oh god, i hope the old scooby-doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!) anyways, like wnsd, a really bad addition to the scooby canon.

as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scooby.if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special saturday morning cartoon. but that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" scooby and gang. i'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but i'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series(where are you).scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this. let's hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers.

i am 17, and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes. i love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade, scooby doo and the goblin king, which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. anyway, back to get a clue! i watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what i saw of it, i wasn't impressed at all. first of all, i hated the animation. it was flat, deflated and very saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation. even worse, shaggy and scooby looked like aliens, and i really missed fred, velma and daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when scooby doo was positively good. i also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby-doo where are you? show. the theme tune wasn't very good either, i can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. though, i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might i add. in conclusion, i personally thought it was awful, and i am not trying to discredit it, it's what i personally feel. 1/10 bethany cox

shaggy & scooby-doo get a clue. it's like watching a much-loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness!! clearly the work of people with no soul, no love or respect for the original work. what in the name of all that's holy were they thinking of? it seems they were trying to go all post-modern and ironic. instead it's just abysmal swill!! what's the point in taking up a successful franchise like 'scooby-doo' if you just going to flush it down the toilet? my son loves the original series - and even some of the spin-off movies - but he can't stand this drivel! and let's face it, you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year-old

the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. i didn't think much of the scooby doo animated movies, (i'm talking about the tv series, not the full length movies.), but some of them were pretty cool, and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. as soon as i saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and i use that term loosely) speak, i cringed. also, mystery inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants. what's new scooby doo was better than this. if you're going to have a scooby doo tv series, include the elements that made the series endure so long. the entire cast of characters, and quality animation. they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came.

on the surface, "show me the money" should have at least finished a full season. you had the always entertaining william shatner as your host, surrounded by a baker's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called "the million dollar dancers." you had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. and you had big money! so, what went wrong? the format of this game was the failure. a good game show needs at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home. the best, most enduring ones have all three.unfortunately, smtm had none.the rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history. let me try to explain how the game worked, as briefly as possible.a contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters a, b, c (subtle plug for the network?). each letter was connected to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. once a contestant chose one of the letters, they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter. if they passed, they got to view the next question, and had the same option. however, if they passed the second question, they were required to answer the third option.after they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct, they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side. they revealed their dollar amount (ranging from $20,000 to $250,000) and depending on if the contestant answered right... or answered wrong... that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot.still with me so far? in addition, there was one dancer who held something known as "the killer card." if you selected the dancer with the killer card and you had gotten your question right, you were safe, and the game continued. if, however, you were incorrect, you had one final question to answer. if you got that final question wrong, you were out of the game. if you got it right, then, the game continued.there was no quitting, no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldn't earn enough money to get back out. got it? okay! the biggest problem, as i saw it, was a complete lack of tension, because of the design of the game. a contestant could pass questions they knew they didn't know, and answer many questions they did know, making the pressure even less. then, they could still find a low dollar amount, even after knowingly missing a question, which meant there still wasn't any "drama." and the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. and the pacing of the questions was deadly slow: often the questions were so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers.the pacing, the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite shatner's terpsichorean talents.

i don't see enough tv game shows to understand the attraction of show me the money, but i suppose it holds some appeal for undemanding audiences. ostensibly a quiz show, it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions. however, its quiz elements play only a small part in the proceedings, which i find tortuously complicated. for example, before answering a question, a contestant selects which question is to be asked by choosing from among random "a," "b," or "c" choices. does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down? it would be a lot quicker simply to start with "a." contestants can pass on questions, but must answer one of the three questions in each category.after responding to a question, the contestant is then asked to "lock in" the answer--another delaying tactic. the contestant's next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go-go dancers in cages is to unveil a card that indicates how much the question is worth. a correct answer adds the card's dollar figure to the contestant's running total; a wrong answer subtracts the same sum. this time-consuming step actually has some entertainment value, as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers. meanwhile, the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the "killer card" will end the game instantly. this naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further delays as the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars. my suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show's chief audience appeal.meanwhile, the whole process is slowed down even more by a lot of empty banter between host william shatner and the contestant, along with occasional routines by the caged dancers. all these delays burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed.a typical 30-minute episode of jeopardy often gets through as many as 60 questions. the first 30 minutes of smtm that i watched got through only six questions (many of which pertained to other tv shows). no one in his right mind would watch this show because it's fun to play along by answering the questions at home. that leaves three possible reasons to watch the show.a. to see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars, only to lose everything in one stroke.b. to look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines.c. to enjoy william shatner's scintillating banter.my choice is "b," but the women aren't on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show.

the comment by "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program. but it is a hoot to watch william shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the " " marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does). this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing, or so, to see shatner, who seems to have taken "camp" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself. but the guy is funny.the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.i watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally "dumber than a :post," yet through sheer luck, walked away with a quarter mil or so. the second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but who'd be lucky to gain $1,000 on jeopardy!, got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he didn't know, and thereby left with zilch.this plethora of game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums to everyday individuals, are admittedly a cheap effort, overall, to attempt to woo viewers. even if the host is well-compensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals as well.but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long. this one has already pretty much reached this point. i think his offerings, especially with james spader, and the others on "boston legal" should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatner's offerings.again, the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance, perhaps one time; that should be sufficient.

while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in, (and i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal), well, this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down.it has none of the intelligence of millionaire, none of the flair of deal or no deal.this show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time.i watched it of course just to check it out. i did watch it for over 45 minutes, then i had to turn it off.the best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage. he is a hoot!!! unfortunately, this show will not make it.that's a given

bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist. cinema was one of his biggest passions (he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life. but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews: "tiré à part" (1996) in spite of terence stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters, "une affaire de goût" (2000) was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance, "pas si grave" (2003) was another let-down and "un petit jeu sans conséquence" is as underwhelming as its predecessors. its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way.and however, the starting idea let predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion. to play with their guests, they pretend to part company with each other. and things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them. the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple.in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal, rapp's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. the plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters who have specific well-known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are. verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable. they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them, especially sandrine kiberlain. the audience is soon caught in a deep torpor.it's regrettable to say it: bernard rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as "un petit jeu sans conséquence" bears witness.

ugh. this is a terrible film, full of disastrous comic relief, no scares, and scary leaps in story and plotline. the only creepy thing here is the leading lady's hats. lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows. i give this a 1, and this ain't no fun.

bela lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance/hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep bela's wife eternally young. some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. bela lugosi hams it up nicely, but you can tell he needed the money. this film is thoroughly awful, and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film. i got the dvd in a discount store 2 for £1, which i think is a pretty accurate valuation, anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind.

i bought this video at walmart's $1 bin. i think i over-paid!!! in the 1940s, bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios (in this case, monogram--the ones who made most of the bowry boys films). while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved (ed wood "classics" such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space), they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans.i am an old movie junkie, so i gave this a try. besides, a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this one.lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides. they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all.anyways, a really annoying female reporter (a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen! so, she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi. lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf). naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! eventually, the maniacs all die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well. at the conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry. and, naturally, the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs. if you haven't noticed, there's a lot of fainting in this film. or, maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!

if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr, then this is the film for you. if not then choose another dvd from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs. the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end. the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap, b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g's and a key, bloody streetz and menace. i would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot , editing and acting really don't matter to you. it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity!!!

all i can say after watching snitch'd is please stop mr. cahill. it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research. it's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.i laughed at the part when mr. cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. this movie was tough as an after school special. who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. i suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever made.

i watched this....let me rephrase...suffered through this because i'm a fan of eva's. i don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos. i like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close. the budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on the caterer.the premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not.i won't bother saying who did what and how, because it isn't worth the effort. i'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that i didn't have to actually pay for this garbage.oh!! before you flame on me, i love movies, i thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed, so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know.

worst movie ever!!!! can't believe i wasted 90min of my life watching this crap. the only reason i didn't turn it off was i wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasn't even in it talk about false advertising. the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumb,stupid or cast members or friends of cast members.i gave it a solid 2 because no one else didi have to write more and i don't even want to. wasting my time talking about this rubbish. please don't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs. bottom 100 movies. i can't even tell you how bad it really is. think the worst movie ever that you've seen then times that be ten and thats this movie. it sucked!! if you just think i'm being bitter then watch it i dare you!! this movie should be used to torture war criminals or terriosts. if they watch this even two times and they'll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy!!

i bought this dvd for £1 and now i realise why. the acting was the worst i've seen in a long time. the lighting and sound are shoddy at best. the plot makes little sense even when sober (warning: i don't advise watching this film when sober.) this film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much. it really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste, i look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career, other than eva longoria who is the only "star" of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick. i'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but i will say one thing to james cahill, don't try it again. in the words of squirlyem "its severely lacking in the good department".

i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it. the acting was bad. was the principal a robot? he had no personality and his facial expression didn't change through the whole movie. at times the voices didn't match up. people talking and their lips didn't even move.

i don't really know where to start. the acting in this movie was really terrible, i can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act. not only the acting was bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well.then there's the action. i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot, there's blood involved. but when someone gets shot in snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there's no blood at all. well, i guess that's just me.to make a long story short (because believe me, i can go on for hours about this film), this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw. this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt.

i got this dvd from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that probably keeps going on..) even the cover of the dvd looks cheap, as is the entire movie. gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors i´ve seen in my life, a very simple plot, it made me laugh ´till my stomach hurt! with very few financial resources, i must admit it looked pretty professional. seen as a movie, it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody´s waiting for. so: if you´re tired and want a cheap laugh, see this movie. if not, throw it out of the window.

the video quality is awful. the sound quality is pathetic. the acting is horrific. the dialog is painful. the lighting is dismal. the editing is laughable. i could go on, but it would be pointless. snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film. this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin.

the plot has already been described by other reviewers, so i will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see gabrielle drake in all her undoubted glory.miss drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of "posh totty" to have been committed to celluloid. of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite jane asher comes close. what was it about actresses with musical brothers? (nick drake and peter asher) for those who like me have admired gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. she has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.as a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made. the song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling.

this is a horrid disaster of a film. from beginning to end, it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. the only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by streisand, because the kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. the main problem of this film is that we never see kristofferson's character at his peak or streisand's character struggling. the first should be seen in decline and the second rising. the final streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly. the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. this film must have been directed and edited by an nyu film school dropout. the only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay. the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions.

rock star john norman howard (kris kristofferson) turns lounge singer esther hoffman (barbra streisand) into an overnight singing star. esther's star rises while john's goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. after about two hours, john does the self-destructive-red-converible-160-mph-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. the best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, "evergreen." barbra streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star. the very first time she appears, singing in a back alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night, not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. she is too confident, too professional. her apartment looks like a page out of "apartment living," not some hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.kris kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like...well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent. the direction is tepid, the story is slow and dull.but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, or the lame direction, or the slow story. it's the hair! after staring at kristofferson's and streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2+ hours, your eyes hurt.

really an amazing pile of pap! a predictable, slow moving, soul destroying, mind numbing movie to which, slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems... well, almost necessary.the acting is over done for the thin dialogue, every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be, the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words. the music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie, but really, three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie.watching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me.never, ever, ever again.

so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater. as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic, tear-jerking barbra streisand film; something like the way we were. i was certainly wrong. the chemistry between the two main characters, esther hoffman and her john howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. there wasn't anything romantic about it. streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast-forward button. at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. there's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and i kept asking myself when it was going to end.the death of john howard was completely predictable. there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever. it wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard.the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs. the ending of the movie when she sings "with one more look at you/watch closely now" was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.

to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this: its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up, followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of ms. streisand -- striking a christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. over ten uninterrupted minutes of barbra's distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. that just might be some sort of cinematic record.or think about this: the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar kris kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. nor, though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties, do they actually sing a duet.or consider this: streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for "musical concepts" and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted, but failed to get co-directing credit as well. one of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser, jon peters. as such, streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. what it doesn't explain is how come, given every opportunity to make the great diva look good, their efforts only make streisand look bad. even though this was one of streisand's greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance.anyway, moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll, streisand plays esther hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom, who shares the fast lane for a while with kristofferson's john norman howard, a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to has-beenville. in the previous incarnations of the story, "norman maine" sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer "vicky lester" achieve her success. in the feminist seventies, streisand & co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man, so the trajectory is skewed; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. as such, there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit.kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. the two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. the only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. and, indeed, had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way, to make streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain, the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist.but i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim; they don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. but sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio the oreos. and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman, yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from "esther blodgett" so that streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive. so much for ethnic pride.the backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. nominal director frank pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert surtees. and the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the oscar-winning "evergreen" by paul williams and streisand). but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be, a vanity project.

ok, people, honestly... this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz that's ever been made, but i've been laughing myself silly (which may be why i enjoyed it). basically, it's all about sex, sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame. did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie? if you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and don't have something better to do). ***attention spoilers!!!*** the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat (!) on the show and flashing his wallet with his love's pictures. a triple a for bad taste and fun!

there are movies like "plan 9" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like "waterworld" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like "desperate living" that you hate to admit you love. cowgirls have none of these redemptions. the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what i've been told, the book is enjoyable.how then could this movie be so intolerably bad? to begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations. open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way. finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. he does have twenty years of cutting experience.this movie now defines the basement for me. it is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.

this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. cool title, excellent director (i saw "to die for" and "drugstore cowboy" before this), and hey - uma thurman in the cast. how can you go wrong? well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this turkey.disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. its critical lambasting was well deserved. you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. zero out of ****.

certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form, featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by rain joan of arc phoenix (river's sister, inevitably), as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbins, the author of the novel, which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charms.

i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix. i thought i would give their sister a try, rain phoenix. i regret checking it out. she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? i have never been so unsatisfied in my life. it was just total rubbish. i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. i thought she was everything but that. those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? whats the point??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. hopefully, rain is better in other films, i forgive her for this one performance, i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film.

i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought "time to watch it". big mistake!a long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks, take for example pat morita. even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. even when you see it in the "under $5" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the urge!

i won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this. this was completely old fashioned. at every stage of this movie, i hoped for some twist and what do i get? the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. they are so darn shy even after so many meetings. i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. all she did was crib madly. hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. this movie is a dream. happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie. anyway i believe i wasted my time. i give it a 2/10.

i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, i gotta come really hard on it. talking about vivah, this guy, sooraj badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. after success of hum aapke hain kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind.there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say 'oh! at least this thing is good'. aloknath does cliché in a role of girl's father, shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed, amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.now the spoiler, i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.

in director sooraj barjatya's vivah,20-something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure, small-town girl his father has selected for him to marry. drawn to her innocence and simplicity, shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he's met her at her home in madhupur, and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor. the marriage is fixed for six months later, and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young, budding love, their geographical distance notwithstanding. but amrita, who's been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents' death, is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage. and then, it's up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally.much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain, barjatya's new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise. but sadly, the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated, even more far-fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps. and the problem is clear  you just can't relate to such squeaky-clean characters who don't have one bad bone in their bodies. there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films, and timing is one such important factor. twenty-five years ago, perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch, but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp. perhaps the film's only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish, you can make out right away that the filmmaker's intention is not to deceive. judging both by barjatya's previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world, he believes in his good-as-gold characters, he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps.but alas, he's unable to translate his vision to the screen. it's difficult to overlook how one-dimensional his protagonists are  shahid and amrita, both virtuous and virginal  i mean, think about it, the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film. barjatya may think he's returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah, but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film, or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry. because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah, those pairs had mischief and masti. shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring.for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story, the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s-style tunes that only further slacken the film's deadening pace. but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn't work for me, it's because i'm not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya's story. to some perhaps, vivah will give hope, that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere. but i'm a little cynical i guess. so, give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun, give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya, i'll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain. but save me from these dullards. you know, some marriages aren't made in heaven. this one's vivah!

from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even peter falk can't find his way) "finding john christmas" is better left lost. ms. bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah. jennifer pisana as soccoro, the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. but who can blame them with material like this. michael j. murray's script is juvenile at best. each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. films like "miracle on 34th street", ernst lubitsch's delightful "the shop around the corner" and, of course the 1951 version of "scrooge". there's frank capra's classics "it's a wonderful life" and "meet john doe". hey, forget the classics. what about "home alone" or " home for the holidays" with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr.? my present to you is by way of advice. your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "finding john christmas". merry christmas!

william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie. he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. but he tries to keep away from his family. thats where peter falk (colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (peter falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. but william russ wasn't truly a star. however, it appears his acting is still ok.i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. in fact, the last 20 minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened. a good movie should never be like that.overall, it was a sub-par movie. in a letter grading system, it would receive a "d".

the silent one-panel cartoon henry comes to fleischer studios, billed as "the world's funniest human" in this dull little cartoon. betty, long past her prime, thanks to the production code, is running a pet shop and leaves henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. a bore.

beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.the opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.and aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time. pure genius.the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. perhaps i own the only copy in existence.

this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules verne's "mysterious island". the sound editing is pretty bad. you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new hampshire. for those living in new engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital w. this film is full of flaws. you get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. "ok now stand up." as for the other characters. there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. the alien guy talks with a deep voice. when he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. as for the special effects, man! this was brett piper's early work for crying out loud! the creatures are good but the animation is jerky. really jerky. sort of like karl zeman animation in journey to beginning of time (1955). the special effects are imaginative. thge music is good. bottom line, this film makes equinox or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray harryhausen epic. did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? a must watch for aspiring film makers.

it was 9:30 pm last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park (a new episode). the thing is, in my country, south park airs at 10:30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, father of the pride. i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes. the first time i watched it, i found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so i thought ''holy sh*t, i have a football game early tomorrow, so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. but yesterday, i tried to give father of the pride a second chance. i find that it's a complete rip-off of the simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv-14 rating. i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. the simpsons is also a lot more violent (halloween specials) and crude. i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2, well i've got news for him: shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic. however, i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.all in all, i don't mind father of the pride. i don't hate it, but i don't like either. i've seen way better from ''the simpsons''.3.5/10

when will the hurting stop? i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again. they keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. as if people learn. the numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t.

saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. don't get me wrong, george c. scott was terrific as scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: "merry christmas to everyone!" other times i almost fell asleep.the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug. after 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all.i can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. instead of this piece of garbage, i recommend to you, the bill murray comedy scrooged. that at least, was funny...

having seen three other versions of the same film, i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to scott's rather dull and leaden performance. his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better. when scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version. even the musical version (and frankly the muppets) take on this are better executed. very disappointing.

i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.boy, was i disappointed. this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. george c. scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. the rest of the time he was quite flat.i realize that this was made in '84, pre-cg effects, for the most part. but it looked to be very b-movie quality, especially the encounter with jacob marley.the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime.i will admit that mr. scott did a good job with the "reformed" scrooge at the end. that was a refreshing portrayal.i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. and tiny tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...

uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; edward woodward, as the ghost of christmas present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins. as scrooge, george c. scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. the scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. no one else seems to be putting any effort in, except frank finlay, who chronically overacts.

the premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that i'm a movie critic. with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. i'm a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3, and some others (many).the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong. this is a highschoolers approach to cinema. for the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. if one is a takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. it lacks any originality (see the neverending story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be miike's personality would spill over into the screen. all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography.the movie had the potential to be something great. the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. but this one seemed to have been run into the ground.my suggestion is if you're just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu, ichi, and audition. then movie into his works like blue's harp, fudoh, rainy dog, bird people of china.

ah, bait. how do i hate thee? let me count the ways. 1. you try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. instead, i want to hurl. 2. you try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like bill gates, and is about as scary as...well, bill gates. (just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. doesn't work, does it? a lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. doesn't fit.) as for jamie foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. you try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. and when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project, and i find myself nauseated, and once again i want to hurl. 4. you try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only meryl streep for company. this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.

are you familiar with concept of children's artwork? while it is not the greatest picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. if painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. well, this concept of children's artwork is how i felt about fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait. while on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. if you have seen either training day or king arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait. while foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why fuqua's name appears on so many "best of" film lists.i will never disagree with someone that fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon. even in the silly feature bait, you are witness to fuqua's greatness. two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work. alas, in the rest of this film, all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood. we have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are charlie kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel. it is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with bait. i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. i was just tired of the structure, and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it, he did not.then, there was the acting. while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor, i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral. i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral. again, i was disappointed. foxx was annoying. not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot. instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. fuqua should have stopped this immediately. foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. instead of character development, he would crack a joke. neither style worked, no joke was funny. the rest of the cast was average. by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles. they were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. they were pawns filling in dead air space. fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.overall, this was a sad film. with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. in each scene i saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. are my words harsh? i don't think so. when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. bait contained none of these. while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. apparently, i took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble.grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch)

what? is jamie foxx supposed to be funny?does he really believe he is funny?well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.the man has no identity whatsoever...i mean you can immediately see who his idols are, denzel washington and martin lawrence, because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.the only problem is that he does it bad, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel, with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence, the funny and clumsy-silly comic. there's no personal touch to all that, i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and i'm sure he has nothing to say personally. he really is mr. dull-boy in person.i was really hoping hollywood, and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom, like don cheadle for example, but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.

photography was too jumpy to follow. dark scenes hard to see.had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere. too noisy for what was really happening bottom line is it's a baddddd movie

well, i can and will be very short. this is a wrong-balanced, non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better. the script seems to not know which way to go ... from funny to cliche-wise serious... it's a bit silly. that plus too much sentences we have heard before "the hacker is in florida, or no, he is in madrid, no he is in ... , he is screwing the signal". 4 out of 10

jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before. the bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "in the line of fire". the cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf...

remember the name kevin lime - and please, please never lethim direct again. timing, pacing, editing: all hopelessly wrong.three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, walk off theset) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like aliceevans, and the kind of production standards you'd expect fromteen-produced children's shows on british tv.greatest mystery: the music. a score so inept, inappropriate andill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it isa case of sabotage. add an acoustic that booms apparentlyunengineered from a single mike, and a director who onlyintermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen, and wehave what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result ofrecent years.

this film was pure pain. sitting in the theater for x-amount of minutes, i was wondering when the film was going to start. all the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their short-givings, villain has to emerge, but none of it ever initiated. by the time these things happened, i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. in scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. kid's stuff does not have to be this way. children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones. the excuse, "hey , its for kids," is bull. i'll take "sword in the stone" any day. this was terrible. i'm getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days. and as for the kids, the 10-year i saw this with will agree...pure trash.

...because this was simply awful. 101 dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is nothing more than puerile drivel. the same plot except with the story excised from it; the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw; tim mcinnerny proving that he really can't do comedy (everone remembers percy in blackadder but that was his high spot - it's all been downhill since then); direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time. ieuan grufford better go back to hornblower sharpish, whilst glenn close and gerard diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.perhaps i could be too harsh; after all i didn't manage to sit through the whole film. it gets 1/10; only because i can't give it 0.

it is a good film for kids who love dogs. it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up de vil. the basic plot is the same as the first movie. the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog. the bird talks like a human(eric idle of monty python) and barks like a dog. it is the comedy that the film needed more of. see it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney.

jamie foxx is my favorite comedian. however, i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker, martin lawrence and dave chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (see: money talks, blue streak).okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream. or in living color's tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee's satire bamboozled.

after seeing the 1996 remake, i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. the whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. but there was actually no need for a second one. first of all, if cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. i thought it was not very funny. it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. i'd expected that it should be lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having roger and anita back too. however, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only three puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). gerard depardieu's part was pointless. at the end, cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. she gets baked inside a giant cake. that was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. that just didn't work. it was too much over the top, and not too funny. i actually felt sorry about cruella.

i wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this. with puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to cruella's scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child. the live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids.i don't know what the disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level. the puppies are cute but this movie is spotty at best.

102 dalmatians (2000, dir. kevin lima) believed to be cured, cruella de vil (close) is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life. things are going well for cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street. when the clock strikes on big ben, things turn bad. the hypnotic cure is reversed and cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted.glenn close reprises her role as cruella de vil and once again is the highlight of the film. every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel, which feels more of a repeat of the previous film, rather than a new story.she's changed.  ken sheperd (ioan gruffudd)

sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother, frank...well, roll out those awards now! mullet haired, muppet frank seems to think that every part he plays, calls for him doing the role as an american/italian wise-guy refugee from the 'godfather.' please, somebody make him an acting offer 'he can refuse!' this film just stinks the place out, even by the terrible overacting in this, frank still steals the acting dishonours. all the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about, gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films.the plot, what there, is, makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex-crazed nymphets but as this is 15 certificate film, that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat. what happens in the end, i'm not quite sure as i was losing the will to live long before the film finished.avoid this like the plague and watch 'deep impact' for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth.n.b. point of order: when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear, she has her knickers/panties under her suspenders/garter belt, it's knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss. a trivial point, perhaps, but shows how dumb this film is when they can't even get this right!

to say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks. as the other commenter says, this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially, incredibly insulting to gays). it is awful - and not in a "so bad it's funny" sort of way either - it's just plain awful. no, i have to say it: it stinks! (sorry skunks).from the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for. the "plot" is incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the acting is of the over the top mugging "look at me i'm being funny!" school and so it goes on. the set pieces are clumsily set up (if at all) and are badly executed, it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe, i don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).to be fair to the makers, they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title "also starring ertha kitt as the voice of betty the meteor" (since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted ms. kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: "...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around uranus." uranus - "your anus" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? your anus? the humour really is that cheap.it says strange things about the "comedies" of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say "sh*t" out loud.i paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie in a sale. i feel ripped off.

this film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. but it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. that's semi watchable.the storyline (what little there is) makes virtually no sense whatsoever. the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds. many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials.. none of them went on to anything else that i'm aware of. and of course sly stallone's even less talented brother well..... =\trivia: it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont, ont. (about 20 miles n.east of toronto) i recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings. i think the drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished "oshawa drive-in" just before it was torn down.

i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals, where we would set out to rent a bunch of b-movies and vote for who picked the worst.the night we watched this, it was voted the best, due to semblance of plot and fun costuming.this is certainly a silly, kitschy, movie, to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low-budget fluff. personally, however, i wouldn't recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it's own mark on you.it made enough of an impression on me that i've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years.a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies. this one is fun, and i remember bouncy music ...

this bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, with no humor and only absurd situations. really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. reality is not one of its strong points. i give it a 1 out of 10. i would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted. sorry, but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles. but then at times we all need to have money. and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars. nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey. but if that was a turkey, this movie then is not even a gizzard. i wish i could say, "give me back my money". you can bet i would if i could. but that is the trouble with premium services, the subscription variety.

the director sidney j. furie has created in hollow point a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. sidney j. furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'. the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher.one and a half stars.p.s. nothing in this movie makes any sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane.

hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no thought required. there are the requisite explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies. a pretty good cast with donald sutherland, john lithgow, and the lovely tia carrere. this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one..on a scale of one to ten ..a 4

spoiler alert ! ! ! personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams life,i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated,or forced.i think secret service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service,now he's motivations are clear,well known.but as a rental this film will not satisfy you,cause the old but used twists,the average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.clark johnson as the director of s.w.a.t. did a far better work like this time,and i still wondering how the producers (for example michael douglas)left this film to theaters.

a bum gives a secret serviceman a tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. baloney. how did the bum know? the script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the secret service works, but who cares. most of this just slows down the movie. all the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies. then, after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out-guns all his buddies, we have a shootout in the toronto city hall. the canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs, but how did they get into this? finally, all is worked out. but it still makes no sense.

it saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors, locations and genres, i.e. douglas, sutherland, washington, d.c. and political thriller, but 'the sentinel' really hits a low. it's like they had a great idea up front, signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest. and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger (not only do i feel she's one of the worst actors in hollywood, but i'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one, and definitely the only bad actor in the film, to win an acting oscar for 'l.a. confidential.') but she wasn't the only problem. sutherland, who i love as jack bauer on '24' once again playsjack. i miss his old 'a time to kill' or 'a few good men' days. douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in. plot: someone, some secret service traitor, wants the president dead and douglas is (haphazardly) being framed. will someone believe him? actually, no spoiler here: as quickly as they came up with that subplot half-way through, it's over before you know it. and why did someone(s) want the president dead? is that to be revealed in the sequel? too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'the sentinel' is. if you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one 'law & order' episode you'll know in the first few frames. was it terrible? not really, the cinematography was good, and despite sutherland playing jack again, he's still got it.

i saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and i excited. it looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's. it recalled me also fugitive movies, a cat and mouse chase between douglas and sutherland. however, the sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. as i see, many people say that this is like a tv movie. not exactly. firstly, there are much more better tv movies in this genre. secondly, tv movies might be very fun sometimes, but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time. it is not stylish at all visually and the most important, the tone of the movie is unappealing. this is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash. also they are not big action scenes, but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie. the love affair between douglas and bassinger was very unnecessary. besides, the assassination plot to the president is the most cliché story in this genre either, but they insist on that. and this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be. although, douglas is very old now, he has still potential for acting in an action thriller. in the film, michael douglas cannot be like tommy lee jones, for example. sutherland is a wrong choice either, because you feel as if you watch jack bauer and somehow, its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a tv movie, eva longoria parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or straight in this movie, because she is a soap opera actress. the movie was not fun even one second to me, so i could not get over for a while.

not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller "the sentinel". the sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me, not delivering the consistent action, a couple of critics promised on the back. to me it seemed like everyone was halfassing it, and only there to make some quick cash, because this felt very much like a made for tv film. the sentinel is a rehash of several better films, like "in the line of fire" this does not have any originality in it, and watching michael douglas run around, felt kinda silly in my opinion. the main problem besides it's unoriginality, had to be the poor pace. i often got distracted while trying to view this movie, while looking how much run time was left, more then once. not only the miscasting with eva longoria, who couldn't convince worth a lick.performances. michael douglas is usually a dependable actor, here is obviously going through the motions. he does not convince as a man on a run, or a secret agent. his chemistry with bassinger, was also off. i'm a big fan of kiefer sutherland, but here he is only ok, nothing more then that. he tries to come across as a gruff, but managed to be more bland then anything else, and to be honest, he didn't seem that interested. eva longoria parker is pretty mediocre. she does not convince in her role, and was pure eye candy. kim basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady. she looks bored to tears, and her role is a throw away, more then anything else. martin donovan has a big part in the end, but not enough to matter for me.bottom line. the sentinel is yet, another political thriller, that bored me to tears. it's too old, too tired, and most importantly the lack of effort sucked. not recommended.4/10

i've been willing to put up with a lot from late-spring/summer action fluff movies, but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff (i.e. cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, steve buscemi, etc.). this movie, however, had none of this. all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longoria's cleavage (an issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). there is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. i would get into specifics, but quite frankly i've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie.the entire time i was in the theater, i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd. save your money on this one, folks. unless you really, really, really like eva longoria's cleavage.

i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and despite the fact that i didn't pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off. ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat. the acting is torpid at best; kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer, and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta-jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey. eva longoria is a non-entity; she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter. and if you can't spot the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines. if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent in the line of fire. if you see and buy into this one, you'll start to fear for the president's safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210. no matter what your feelings about w, let's hope this "art" does not imitate life.

seriously, i don't even know where to begin. it's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. the editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.here's a spoiler for you; this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. however, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; deterrance, dark blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.

there is good. there is bad. and then their is the sentinel, a bottom-barrel political "thriller" that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen. the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one, but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered. directed with ham-handed "edginess" by clark johnson, every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot. even the great michael douglas looks bored here. i can honestly say i have never, in all my life, viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes. the twist is predictable from square one, and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. avoid this at all costs. this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value.

lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money!!this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk. the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with. if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen, flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket.. you may get more enjoyment that way. the acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (along with the so called "twist" in the end. i must say this.. the ending did surprise me. i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn't even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room.casting was awful for a few reasons. first of all, they must have accidentally switched the character assignments, because michael douglas played the roll that clearly keifer sutherland should have been playing. while douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him, sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him. he plays a very bland agent, nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love.i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. it can be best compared to a remake of the "the fugitive" / "in the line of fire" but written by people with mental disabilities

the 60s (1999) d: mark piznarski. josh hamilton, julia stiles, jerry o'connell, jeremy sisto, jordana brewster, leonard roberts, bill smitrovich, annie corley, charles s. dutton. nbc mini-series (later released to video/dvd as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. the film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. however, dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. rating: 4 out of 10. not rated (later rated pg-13 for video/dvd release).

the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. racial tensions, politics, the vietnam war, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.in this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. during the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.on the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. the movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.

is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television (or the media in general) as the 1960s? no. and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? not really. but if we must have one, does it have to be as shallow as "the '60s"? i like to think that co-writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted, especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie "dear america: letters home from vietnam" which utilized little original music and no original footage, letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves. this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production, but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time; like so many of its ilk, it's seen from the point of view of one family. but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s (it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont), making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade.the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clichéd - and then when they're back on blammo! it's something else. garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. in fairness, jerry o'connell, jordana brewster, jeremy sisto, julia stiles and charles s. dutton give their material the old college try, but they're wasted (especially the latter two); it's undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton, and rosanna arquette (in an uncredited cameo in part 2) is always welcome.what isn't welcome is how "the '60s" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post-60s america never mentions the british invasion - no beatles, no rolling stones... then again, there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?). capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending, "american dreams" and "the wonder years" did it all much, much better. nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere, people... except for julia stiles doing the twist, that is.

do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation? technically, i am a boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; i was still in grade school. but i remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive.this is just another excercise in self-importance from the kids who never really grew up.

it is of course very nice to see improvements on turkish movie industry, however, i would have expected something more creative from togan gokbakar. starting from the script, which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think. especially the cheesiness of the dialogs, which were putting the audience in a position that, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations, which, most of the times makes the movie unbearable. it also has an obvious ending; you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning. the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people, like professionals right away!!!did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals, to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use?????!!!!!!also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient, with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film. and that scene was so suitable for "dikkat sahan cikabilir" title!! those are not the only weak parts of the movie. there were also a lot of preciosities in the film. the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from hannibal, also appearance of togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie! the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it. gen is a total disappointment. i would have wonder, if sahan was not this famous, would togan be able to shoot this movie, with this much of budget amount?? i hope togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview. it was hitchcock who did it wisely and night shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not hitchcock nor shyamalan yet!!!!hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry!

the title above is used to introduce the film "gen" to its audience. gen is about a young doctor(doga rutkay) with an ill mother. the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. while she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days.two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. in fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. all their communication with outside world is cut off too. there is no way out!! in those few days, there will be more nasty murders. now everybody suspects from each other.in my opinion, the idea is brilliant. it could have been very scary indeed. there are positive sides of the movie of course. i really like the beginning of the movie. especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. actings are okay. some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. what i am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn't work well. also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. lastly, i would like to say a few things about the director. i am sure he will improve. this is his first attempt. i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old. that made me feel more positive about him and his future films. i am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.

it's a bad movie, it seems like there is only 5 police in hk, they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chan's movie. all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only. when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. in the movie, it's like all the good guys died without a reason.they story line of the movie also sucks, the story jump here and there and bored people. but if you wanted to see a bloody movie, i think this is only a ok type of movie, i think u.s. made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one

this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. the plot and message are horrible. there are too many mistakes in this movie that it's impossible to keep up. i don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination, let alone 2. here's why: 1) sam lee portrays a angry/irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad. pros: he's angry alright. cons: when it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the sadness/disappointment he has in his father. the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes.2) to connect the movie to the title, there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. i understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not... but it's just sooo dumb! 3) why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer? what the heck is wrong with this movie. when the killer started stabbing an officer, shoot him. he's already dead! what the heck? there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed, but i do not know why he wasn't! 4) during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt. in the scene, it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt, so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot? and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer? wtf? 5) the sounds in the movie are off sync.6) i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia, so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight? 7) this movie is just too violent without a purpose. cops are beating ci to a pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? this is overall the worst movie. i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person. i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life. worst movie ever!

first: i bought it at the video store. second: i watched it. third: it was boring. fourth: it was not funny. fifth: most of the antics were lame. and last, but not least: it's not only a bad movie, it's a total fiasco.i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film. i pity it because it was his first movie. even if you are a huge adam sandler fan, don't bother watching this movie. instead, just take the video, board a yacht, and throw it overboard.

i wanted to punch the tv. watching it was torture. i hated it. never watch this movie. the terrorists are annoying. adam sandler is annoying. i normally like him but not in this one. i wanted to break the dvd. this is the most irritating film in the world. the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious. the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls. it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv. do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone. if you even like adam sandler a little bit, don't buy it. it will just make you hate him. do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. its a waste of the $1.99 i paid for it.

i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, i have seen cujo. adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. that's the plot. that's it! nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even general noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). add to the mix miss australia, who has the worst australian accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. i highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. i guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be "at least it wasn't as bad as going overboard".

i will start this off by saying i couldn't get all the way through it. i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. i figured there wasn't any way i would regret my purchase. was i wrong or what? seriously now, who approved this project? they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. that's the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad. the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam. the acting isnt much better. i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. yay, who cares... shecky moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. that's about as much of the plot as i understood.overall it's the worst movie i've ever seen. i own it on dvd and have given it to many co-workers to watch. each comes back and laughs and says "wow i didnt think i'd ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in...."my response is always "well now you can"

i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and i`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for itit gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face . bad guys enter the templechild sits with blank expressionbad guys chop up the monkschild sits with blank expressionbad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with ... go on guess ? you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled the wooden childthe title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . in fact that`s the main problem ( and boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too . did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? it`s part fantasy , part martial arts , part buddy movie , part comedy and it`s all crap

bad movie for sure. it's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example), and a real unfunny time. (charles dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (last action hero). (eddie murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and i heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! i'll never understand why or how ?! in one tv interview i've heard (eddie murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! one of the comments said (hey...it's the 1980s !). well, no my friend. it's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. the first is that i'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (charlotte lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. but how odd ! as i've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! anyhow the second reason is that i've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever!the bottom line: bad movie, greeeeeat legs.

michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in the golden child, and because he loves kids. that didn't work (and why should it?), so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing "kid midas". i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ishtar. whatever murphy says or does can be best liked, but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie, and the same went for dr. dolittle! the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic, and that wouldn't have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. speaking of visuals, they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan's presidential fame. murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs, but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste.

why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? burt reynolds peaked, then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks. arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero. and here, loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this "family" adventure flick, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film.the story is pure humdrum. it concerns social worker murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one. chosen for what, i hear you ask. his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. as the main demon, classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, i'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. of all murphy's films, this is easily the worst. i've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role, in a non formulaic kind of film, and while both points are loosely true there's no forgiving the fact that the film - however atypical and non formulaic it might be - is an absolute load of garbage.

well, what's to say. the golden child falls in the category "so bad, it's good". eddie murphy is having some funny (and sometimes quite annoying lines), but you are still entertained. chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa (what a f***ed up name is this??).who should watch the golden child... hm... difficult to say, but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog.4 out of 10

just a dumb old movie. first stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way. in an effort to save him, stanwyck gets unlucky, yet again, and comes across an escaped convict. she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way. in the end her husband is saved, and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is. all's well than ends dumb.i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood's glamour-oriented golden era; that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short, running a little over an hour. it's as though the director sensed that he was making crap, so he thought it best to keep the crap short.

awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming, crisp location photography, but it's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension. i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldn't make it back in time because, really, she was saddled with the wet, in more ways than one, husband,and she had an idiot child as well..why not run off with meeker? but the nagging question remains..what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didn't float? stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best she could with the material but it's threadbare.

definitely one of funny man eddie murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and a "chosen one".murphy is the "chosen one" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". a finder of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman (charlotte lewis) who tells him he is "the chosen one", and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "the golden child". for if the child were to die, compassion would die with him, as he is the bearer of compassion.if all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now, it surely will once the movie begins. suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film. meant to be another vehicle for murphy's egotistical brand of humour (the comedy isn't so great mind you), the movie fails on many levels. even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa can't do much for proceedings. very silly and disappointing.sunday, december 12, 1993 - t.v.

unlike "the adventures of buckaroo banzai", or "big trouble in little china", or "conan the barbarian", which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, the golden child is just plain bad.the premise itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. but here the eddy murphy "flip attitude" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension. the "mystic secrets" of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are faced by real danger, why should we care?who should see this film:-- big fans of eddy murphy who can't help themselves-- i can't think of anyone elsei'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.

this film is self indulgent rubbish. watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. it should be charming but isn't - it's just irritating. the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor. the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister. i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war. there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it. a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland.

i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it didn't. despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow moving, despite having hardly any plot.the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear on this), and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories. the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot, but they're very short, and don't really seem to have any point. the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life, but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that doesn't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure. perfect metaphor for this film really. the photography of skye is beautiful though, but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.

here's why the jane show won't work. once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. i guess these people don't watch a lot of t.v. from the u.s. which has the sitcom model down pat. no, here we have to do something different, we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it. the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: forklift races??? give me freaking break. here's a little advice for the writers of the show, don't write funny situations, find the funny in situations. and remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.

this film should have been fun. a young lea thompson, a young joaquin phoenix... and terry o'quinn. in space. but it dragged on, had unlovable characters and had no target audience.some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs (named, appropriately, jinx). the space scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view. adults will be bored and cheesed out, kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it.there is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle -- this never takes off. why it is included in the first place is unclear, except maybe to add extra tension between the characters - but it failed if that was the idea.a young lea thompson should be quirky and attractive, right? i mean, "back to the future" is great. but no, she was irritating and average-looking. not someone you'd want to date, have as a friend or even consider as a role model. joaquin phoenix? he's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance. maybe he can act like mikey in the life cereal commercials, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy. he doesn't fit in on screen and i don't think we can identify with him at home. i actually would have been happier if he had never returned to earth.i don't recommend this film to anyone.

i'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s, it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn't even remotely possible. others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already.given all that, i still could have sort of enjoyed it, if only they hadn't included all the maudlin, nauseating, infuriating, disneyesque sentimental crap, which is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere more than out in space, where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death.the "crew", as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else. it completely ruined any value the production may have had left.i'm surprised nasa let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. if you haven't seen this yet, save yourself the irritation. watch apollo 13 again. at least that tried to be sort of real.

i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is. it's like watching police academy, except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about, and...wait, there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick. i can understand suspension of disbelief, but this is just complete stupidity. not only is there no plot to this movie. it's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor, throw non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility. plus the people are wearing clothes that are un-befitting for a space program. i feel like i'm watching a valley-girls "b" movie, in space.

space camp, which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the challenger accident, deserves such luck. the "stars" make a mockery of acting, lea thomson actually being turned sideways, when asked for more than her usual wide-eyed innocent smile, presumably to mask her risible attempts. the movie is at times hilarious, when it begins to ask far too much of you. a small boy keeps a multi-million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm-mates. this hackneyed and unlovable machine, "jinx", is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie, which seems part short circuit, part 2001 by the airplane team. i shan't bore you with this, suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it. having said all of this, it is enjoyable to watch, in a seaquest, saved by the bell kind of way. the romance and technology, beware, are as unbelievable as each other. also, if you're an eighties freak, its unmissable for the amusing performances of kate capshaw (willie from temple of doom) and, obviously, lea thompson. also, joaquin phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe goonie who befriends jinx. do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash.

ok, forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold. forget the hideous special effects and poorly-constructed one-dimensional characters. just looking at the premise of the story. the very reason for the film to exist in the first place, and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together.i know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it. the story is horrible. the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible. and whats worse, is that the cable movie channels keep showing it! its on twice a day every two or three days! why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times, much less to see it at all?my recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing. its just not worth it.

i was in second grade, 12 years ago. i remember it clearly. we were learning about space. all little kids want to go to space, right? well, after i saw this, i was so scared to death that i would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind. i had no idea that this was a movie. i thought it was some news program or something. i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'war of the worlds.' so, recently, i get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, joaquin phoenix was in it (then known as leaf phoenix). i can tell you, i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting. i mean, when andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? i don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close. little max is trying to pull her in. suddenly, we get a major close up on max's face as he shouts (in slow motion) "whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" i had no idea.

rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable, they laughed for several hours. after all, unless you are a politician or work/crew the shuttle, you are not going to get in the shuttle. furthermore, space (cadet) camp is in alabama, not florida.the truth is everyone on earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible. this film was meant for kids, and had to have been written by one, because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to ksc/ccafs.this is the most useless film of all time, and it was a well deserved flop.

1st watched 12/26/2008 -(dir-eugene levy): corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers. but this one by charles shyer & nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. the story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling americans, played by richard lewis and sean young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return. upon trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder. the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story. the other cast members include character actors john candy, james belushi, cybill shepherd, george hamilton and others. after the police find out about the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened. none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi/shepherd couple. this isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't that good. there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile. try it, maybe you'll like it, probably you won't.

this is just horrible, really horrible trash. yes, we've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. but while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a "film" with actual things to say, with real emotion and struggle. it isn't. it's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time. i'm sure all of these women (and men) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s . . . but not in the actual movie business.the acting was hackneyed, so bad, i mean real terrible. the writing was even worse. i can't lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with. the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar, as a sniper. these shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough. if there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with.this movie should have been shot, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along; it would have made more money. it practically is a hardcore porn film already, and it remains the only non-porn movie i've seen that shows a male erect penis.

in the standard view, this is a purely awful movie. however, it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie. andy griffith's ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime. i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv, check it out.

too bad chuck norris has gone to tv. he made some good movies before he hit tv. this is a typical tv movie intended to pass the time. unfortunately it wastes chuck's talent as an actor. i hope he returns to the big screen some day.

wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. i will try to tone this one down. lets be real!!! no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main character.there was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. i have to wonder if old chuck just can't hang with the best any more. has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? chuck is an awesome martial artist, and as we have seen from walker, texas ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not. very disappointing for us norris fans. chuck, stay as the main character in your movies, because this does not work for you...gary

okay. who was it? who gave revolver 10 out of 10? are you tripping of your head on ecstasy pipes? there were so many of you. did you do it for a dare? is this some kind of cult? or did guy richie himself sign up 788 times under different names?before i say anything else, i'll say this. just because you don't understand a film doesn't mean that it's not great. maybe you've had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then weren't in the mood. maybe there's a more fundamental stumbling block- like you just don't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it. but. and this is a very, very big but. the xxl elephant-sized mega-but to end all buts.please don't confuse incoherence for complexity, and please don't confuse this two hour non-squirter for an interesting film. really. you may think you are pretty smart. you may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure: an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. please don't. you're embarrassing yourself. revolver's a waste of everyone's time. if you thought about if for a few minutes, you'd recognise it too. it was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of the caterers, and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you can't get them back you know) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable, wretched mess."no - wait," comes a voice in the darkness. "you just don't understand. its non-linear. that means the story doesn't go in a straight line. this is actually the complex and subtle work of an auteur. it addresses difficult existential questions. and anyway - they slated fight club when it first came out - didn't you hear? -because they couldn't deal with the complexity. they're eating humble pie now. bet you hate lynch films too, doncha?" hate to disappoint you, but i am quite a big lynch fan. i rather like memento, so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesn't necessarily fill me with fear. and although i've only studied it briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me greatly. i don't dislike revolver for these reasons. i dislike it because it purports to be about weighty, big-brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable. i'm not much of a chess player, but richie's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old. i dislike it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. "aha!" cries the richie apologist. "guy is cleverly tipping his hat to brecht!" just maybe you're right. i think its more likely that he just can't write a decent script for toffee.comparing revolver with fight club is actually really instructive. fight club has acid-tongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one-liners that make your ears bleed. fight club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened. revolver has, as far as i can tell, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because... well, they don't make sense. if you keep pulling the rug out from under people, they eventually kick you out of their house. and then they lock all the doors and windows. and they never let you back in. ever.guy richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz-phrases. mostly they are spoken, but often they flash up on the screen with attributions. it's almost pathological.but what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichés in the world. ultimately its so inconsequential. you don't care about anything. you don't understand anything. you go home.actually, there was a bit i really liked: the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence. he's great. but i can't recommend you see the film just to see him. he's only in it for a few minutes.please believe me. it's horrible.

i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before. after loving guy ritchie's two previous films (i don't count swept away - he was pussy blind), i was so looking forward to seeing this. the reviews were poor, then again, i don't trust the press anyway. more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation i handed over my £4.80 yesterday afternoon.i'm not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it! unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously.it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots, laughs, snappy dialogue and good characters. it's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones i noticed:the matrix, fight club, kill bill, the usual suspects, vanilla sky...i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors, jason statham and ray liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction that let the film down.so a big, big thumbs down from me.

was convincing the world that he didn't exist...this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. it's from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser gold..i mean sose..i got another one like that: -the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline-this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making i have seen in a long time. it starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. but alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction. and it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts.pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. and they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.and that's all jolly swell. but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. and apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like "fight club, kill bill, casino, the usual suspects, snatch, magnolia and shachnovelle. and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it's a blatant robbery.what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed. if this movie was a roller-coaster ride, you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off. there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it. nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going, you get pulled in yet another one.i guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next david lynch or something.1/10 for totally violating one's own work (ritchy: seek professional help). what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece, food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs. spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all cost!

after seeing "driven" on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created, and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again. unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case. revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it, just so i don't feel like i'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this. its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant, and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters, with totally inane pretentious nonsense! i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film, whilst all the time thinking - what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster/con man, whatever he's supposed to be, when he made his "offer"? i'll tell you what. he would have told him to f**k off, blown his head away, and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jake's head when they offer him their "solution" to his problem? they're con men, therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! i mean ffs. doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know he's been conned. anyway, i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films. bulls**t! this film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines, oh no. it somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny i genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the ugc in sheffield knows how full a main screen can get, and not 1 person so much as smiled. maybe he never wanted the film to be funny, and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy, but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask? the unnecessarily baffling plot!?? i sincerely hope not!by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end. it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over, and they were free from their torment!i'll round this off (i've got to finish, writing this is making me angry again) by elaborating on the "end". i mean sh**t! the ending.. no, sorry i can't, your just going to have to go and see it. it can't be put in words, it just can't, and after you've seen it you'll know why. uuhhhhh  shudders 

ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. here, he raids two recent classics  'the usual suspects' and 'fight club'  and still comes out empty-handed.despite parading itself as a con-mystery (with the sub-'usual suspects' twaddle "the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you" or whatever it was...) and attempting a 'fight-club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. by the last third, you know you're being lead down a blind alley, and tediously slowly at that.cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material.the only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is ritchie's bold way with with a scene and maurice-jones's dynamic camera. if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper.as it is, revolver is a waste of your time. incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. if you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'lost highway'.

guy richie's third proper film (not counting the god-awful "swept away" is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling, gangsters and chess. fans of richie's previous efforts will probably hate revolver as much as i did, with its twists and turns. richie stalwart jason statham plays jake, a newly-released ex-con, out to wreak revenge on the ridiculously named dorothy macha (a superbly ott ray liotta) but instead gets embroiled with a couple of other cons, (one of which is andre 3000 from rap outfit outkast) who throw him and us the audience, a number of red herrings throughout the film, all of which becomes extremely tedious. the high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot, slow-mo shootout set to beethoven's moonlight sonata. all in all, revolver is a flawed work, not truly awful but far from richie's best. that would still be lock, stock. if this film was a school homework assignment it would be graded 'must try harder!'

i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad. i have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss!. watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting. more chance of understanding the film its self. in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this. plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original. i think its one of those love or hate movies. you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it

in 17th century japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. his name was mayeda. he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the king of spain. whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan. shogun mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.starring cinema legends sho kosugi (tenchu: stealth assassins), christopher lee (star wars, lord of the rings trilogy), john rhys davies (lord of the rings trilogy, indiana jones trilogy) and toshiro milfune (the seven samurai, throne of blood), shogun mayeda (kabuto) is a film masterpiece.the osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by bob ivy bring exciting battle/action sequences such as the opening battle against the eastern army, the attack on mayeda's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between sho kosugi and david essex. a fine musical score by famed composer john scott is also present. director sho kusugi was not even nominated for an oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is dealt with extremely well. highly recommended cinematic masterpiece.please note: all of the above is opposite for the film in question.

waldemar daninsky (paul naschy) travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover, and is later revived by a female scientist, dr. ilona ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments.upon hearing of naschy's death from colleague jon kitley, i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch. in my scramble, i found i own not one but three(!) copies of "fury of the wolfman". the film is of questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion, the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times. and the american versions have two love scenes removed. quite frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, i wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory.this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky. i suspect this is true, but you wouldn't know this from the film itself. the plot is confusing at times, and there's really no indication that this is a sequel. if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you'll see that i'm not alone in my confusion.perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. while floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involved in finding a distributor. and naschy said in his autobiography that the director, zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. those really aren't light accusations, and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf.chances are, sooner or later you'll come across a low-grade version of "fury of the wolfman". it appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets, so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know. what really needs to happen is an american uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in. as far as i know, this does not exist. let us honor paul naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves.

apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime; as i said earlier, although i've always wanted to catch one of paul naschy's werewolf pictures, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as awful as it most certainly is, i still intend to pursue other entries in the series, albeit very gradually.despite some high profile disappointments like joe dante's the howling (1981), i love werewolf pictures in general but, to be honest, i quickly lost interest in this film's "plot" and just stood there gazing at my tv screen counting its absurdities as it were. there were far too many to mention them here but i have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf persona (i.e. going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed, zombie-like state in the very next one - as if he's on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside, and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot...and, yes, i did know the reasons for this beforehand), as well as the "phantom of the opera" look of the wolfstein character! but what do i know - perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic!

this is one very confusing movie. the film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense. the fury of the wolfman was made in spain and i think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant. maybe this is part of the problem but i doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film. the dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well. the scenes are choppy, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. what i did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks. now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense, they might have had something. don't waste your time on this one.

how did this ever come into existence? i generally love sci f/bigfoot whatever films etc. . . but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this. the effects were sad, the lines were sadder. avoid at all costs. i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case (i was looking for the sasquatch film with lance henrikson in it -- still haven't seen that one). the idea of the film is actually a good one. there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. i just don't understand how something like this ends up like this. go speak to the film/arts/english interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script.

when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film. usually when you have these types of movies there's generally one sasquatch, but in this one there is like what? 7 or 10 of them?. acting was good, plot was ok, i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims, very good camera work. i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little. this movie was way better than sasquatch. the sci-fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films, i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain, abominibal was not good, the one i'm reviewing is ok, but the movie sasquatch was not, but i'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track. this movie is good for a rainy saterday afternoon, but for any other occasions, no.

oh where to begin. the cinematography was great. when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie. then the cgi bigfoot showed up .it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kong's love child.it totally took away from the believability of the character.now i knew there wasn't a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon.so from then on the whole movie was shot for me.the money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did. his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his.i am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about. i know after you read this review you will still say "i must watch sasquatch hunters,must watch sasquatch hunters." then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie!

this is the biggest piece of lamo i've ever watched. it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was. not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1.the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is "unintentionally funny" are absurd and just plain wrong. not one thing is funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting. honestly though, i didn't watch it to the ending, but that should say something about how horrible it is. worst movie ever.immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie. then zach peed his pants. thankyou for your time.

foywonder's review of this cheap stv hits the nail squarely on the head. make sure you read it. in case you don't, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. the big foot family doesn't take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen. big foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the hendersons. most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. this is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen. we do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches, but nothing comes of this.

i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. i'd have to say i got my money's worth on this one. i had expected horrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. well, as meatloaf said, two outta three ain't bad.the acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies i've seen. or maybe i've watched so many low budget movies recently i've lost perspective. there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's of at least high school play level.the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part. the first thing i thought when i saw it (and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better. clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better.so you may be asking why i call the cg the second-worst part. that's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects. they are loud, annoying, and constant. i've been camping, i know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. usually when the "background" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film, i wasn't missing much.the action was infrequent and boring. the tension was non-existent, as was any sense of empathy with the characters. speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland. the only mildly engaging byplay was between...actually, i can't think of anything. there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile, but that was about it.the cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. however, it still had that "home movie" quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer. if you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks, and you see this one in the dollar bin, think about grabbing it. otherwise, stay away at all costs.

a group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils.they stumble on a bigfoot burial ground eventually (the didn't notice it in the dark), the scenes of the cgi bigfoot are horrid, but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate. i used to think that there just might be a good bigfoot movie to be made. but now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, i'm having serious doubts. to pour salt in the wound of watching this film, the one good-looking girl just doesn't get naked once. and while this one may be better than "boggy creek 2" (no mean feat there), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on bigfoot remains "harry and the henriksons" my grade: d

this is definitely the worst bigfoot movie i've ever seen and quite possibly the overall worst movie i've ever seen in my life. the actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed like they were trying way too hard to play their roles as dorks, tough guys, jerks, know it alls, etc. and the bigfoot itself was terrible. it appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of atari & intellivision. at one point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches were chasing after the remaining survivors, one gets shot and as it's running it looked like a poor man's version of donkey kong himself! and one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was just awful animation. another thing that was annoying was the music. way way way too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the entire film. it was never ending. oh yeah, the movie is boring too. absolutely one of the worst films i've ever seen. i highly recommend taking your $3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. truly awful!

i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot, so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent, this one caught my eye. it was the worst $4.50 i've ever spent and i want my money back! please don't waste your money on this!! this was one of the cheapest movies i've ever seen. the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didn't even watch it all the way through. i just got fed up with it. the acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was just really bad and tasteless. it all added up to be a really bad, boring movie and total waste of time and money. i hope that one day they'll make a good movie about sasquatch, but until then, i'll have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece.

i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great. but what i witnessed was to awful for words. i don't mean to be harsh, its just the movie was terrible. overall it had bad, i mean awful special effects, the acting wasn't too bad, but wasn't good either, and sasquatch himself was like.... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons. its not violent or horror, but it has the best depiction of sasquatch. at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off. only see this movie if you are desperate, or really appreciate anyone in the film. or go watch boondock saints, it is much better.

budget, decent actors ...who knew these things were important. don't waste your time on this piece of junk. the effects are crap. the acting is crap. the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t&a and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes.the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity. it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before. hats off!if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos. the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from frogballs community theater.

that's right. a movie written, directed and produced by fred tepper and family. (fred should have known better, having worked the sets of 'titantic' and 'dogma'.) so, the plot. there are some scientists, and some forest rangers, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. they are all really bad at their jobs, including the hot chick(who i think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are "professional people," which is good, because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoks.they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange ape-like bones, and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot. they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie. we all hope he dies real soon (along with his sister who's meant to be the cute naive one, but is really just annoying). then they, *gasp*, find a sasqu... i mean, ape-like animal burial ground. of course, no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones they're messing with... i guess scientists and forest rangers just don't think about those types of things.then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike, chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) all over again.insipid, boring dialogue (i zoned out several times), inane plot, unlikable characters, bad cgi (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that just wasn't very good all add up to make a movie i won't be watching again.you check it out though; it's good for some unintentional laughs.

there have been many movies featuring bigfoot, the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them. sasquatch hunters doesn't even have that going for it. it's just a crashing bore.sasquatch hunters is about a group of paleontologists, primatologists, and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a pacific northwest forest. bones belonging to some sort of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since apes aren't natural to north america to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition. sure enough, they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these enormous ape-like creatures. i think we all know what happens to people that disturb ancient burial grounds in the movies.the first half of the movie consists of uninteresting, interchangeable characters assembling their gear, hiking through the woods, stopping to rest, hiking through the woods some more, pausing long enough to investigate and discuss a few findings along the way, yet more hiking through the woods, looking for a group member that has vanished, even more hiking through the woods, digging through dirt, random theorizing, and gathering around a campfire to discuss what little they've done that day. when sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time (done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs off-camera). all of this is excruciatingly boring.the movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found, thus we are left with dull, drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared. i'd be lying if i said i didn't make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up.as for sasquatch himself, much like every other character else in the movie, it doesn't have much to do and lacks a distinct personality. it looks like a shaggier version of king kong, which isn't all that bad except in the scenes where they used cgi instead of a man in a bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes. a part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring bigfoot to life is a tad sacrilegious. if there is any single movie monster that i believe should only be brought to life through situation, it's bigfoot.this is one of those movies that doesn't so much have a plot as it does a premise. that's all it really is, a premise, which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie.

director warren beatty's intention to turn chester gould's famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (with beatty himself cast in the lead as the square-jawed detective) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia--quite unusual and intriguing coming from warren beatty. unfortunately, the picture is requisite ham, fun for awhile but eventually tiring. dick tracy attempts to bring down mobster big boy caprice, aided by loving tess trueheart but tripped up by evil breathless mahoney. for the first half-hour or so, the oscar-winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but, as the plot creaks along predictably (with no real sting in the writing), things begin to congeal. al pacino got a surprise supporting oscar nomination as bad boy caprice, and madonna (who is mostly used as a decorative prop) gets to sing stephen sondheim's "sooner or later (i always get my man)", which copped the award for best original song. lots of heart, thanks to beatty--who was dedicated to his vision--but the picture is too cool and calculated. it lacks heat. *1/2 from ****

this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s. when my friends & i were watching this film (being the target audience it was aimed at) we just sat & watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was. the rest of the time, everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film. it must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on. crap acting, crap costumes. i can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch. save yourself an hour & a bit of your life.........

i just saw dick tracy and i thought it was terrible. the paintings in the background of the cities looked awful. also the mob characters looked too weird. warren beatty didn't do an awful job as dick tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances. madonna should just stick to singing. glenne headly did a good job in this movie. i gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the amazing acting by al pacino. it wasn't a high note in his career but he still did a good job.

when people ask me whats the worst movie i've ever seen its this one. its not even close to mst3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theatre, or even as disney channel late night filler. the only time i've ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world (or disney/mgm studios in this case) was to grab dick tracey's jacket off the mannequin, rip it to shreds, and ram it down the tour guides throat saying "eat this! eat this unholy coat of darkness!!!" i've never been so mad at a movie, not even "nutty professor ii: the klumps" or "flash gordon". you want pretty colors and cinematography? ain't here babe. reviewers keep saying "oh, but its too look like a comic book", well, to me, its the color of a gordito after several weeks in the sun. about as enjoyable too. beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch, himself, and occasional at the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting. to be fair, i have only seen this movie once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a god.

this film is stale, and misses the mark. it is far off compared to the 89 batman that it tries to coppy. that women singer whats her name can not act, and we see why her film carrier died. notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either. my uncle and dad were expecting batman, and the films impression is more like cop rock. not worth renting 3/10

as other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. the colors are comic book bold. i think the director got carried away with his "artistic vision" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album "i'm breathless (music inspired by the film dick tracy)" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit "vogue" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to madonna's "i'm breathless" album.if you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think "there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back." save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this.

believe me, i wanted to like "spirit". the idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned, hand-drawn animation again, as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete, had got my blood up ... but then, the insulting, flavourless banality i had to endure in the first ten minutes of "spirit" got my blood up even more.the character designs are generic, the animation (partly as a result) merely competent, the art direction as a whole so utterly, boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about (we know, from "the prince of egypt" and "the road to el-dorado", that there are talented artists at dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of cgi is in every single instance ill-judged. (why do they bother?) there's not a single thing worth looking at. in an animated cartoon, this is fatal.but it gets worse...the horses can't talk, but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in "bambi", which can. and it seems that, in a way, the horses can talk. spirit himself delivers the prologue (sounding for all the world like a 21st-century actor picked out of a shopping mall in california), and from then on his laid-back, decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack, although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know, or expresses a feeling which the artwork, poor though it is, wasn't capable of expressing twice as well. that prologue, by the way: (a) contains information which spirit, we later discover, had know way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas which spirit would lack the power to express even if he could talk; (c) includes new age rubbish like, "this story may not be true, but it's what i remember"; and (d) will give countless children (the production is pitched, i presume, at six-year-olds) the impression that horses are native to north america, which is sort of true, in that the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebras etc. was native to north america - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived, and the mustangs of spirit's herd (which allegedly "belong here like the buffalo grass") were descended from horses introduced by europeans.so the prologue rather annoyed me.as often as spirit talks, bryan adams sings, sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection - and it's not that he sings or even how he sings, it's what he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less, if possible, than spirit's spoken narrative, and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although i was paying close attention, and was able to discern that they probably didn't). if only bryan adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have shut up for a minute or two, the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative, rather than jaw-droppingly bad.

flat, soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film. absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the bryan adams vocals are going to come in, which are always at the wrong time.the main character, spirit the horse, is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening. the narration is not needed, though, as everything happening is really obvious. you can even tell what the horses are saying, although all they do is neigh. which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laughing, etc. there is no variation between the horses' voices.young kids might like this film, though. it's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there's little danger of anyone being frightened. if you have nothing else to do, and want to watch a film with your kids, this isn't a bad choice.but otherwise, this isn't recommended.

decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from dreamworks at least watchable... however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side.. it is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles, but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision. grade: c

even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.as a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of pc mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. i had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how pc showed a world different than what they knew in reality.this dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. but if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.

for anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack, lack of dialogue, clichés up the wazoo, and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an american film, look no farther. dreamworks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent, or really wanted to create an animated episode of national geographic; either way, they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie. spirit: stallion of the cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults, and also fails to entertain despite the oh-so-cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans. after looking past the wonderful animations, what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess.spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful, as he is a horse that cannot be tamed, calmed, nor controlled. because of this, he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high-spirited horses, which includes his mom. but, his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of americans in the process of connecting the wild west with the rest of the country. during this, spirit (never actually named that throughout the entire film almost) befriends a courageous native american, and a fellow female horse, and also has a lot of run-ins with the cynical and cruel army folks that apparently don't believe in giving up.why must movies mix computer animation with traditional? it comes off looking rather meshed, something spirited away suffered from as well. best example is when a train is chasing after spirit; you see the hand-drawn spirit running from a computer-animated train. it would look much better if it were one or the other, but not both; unless you can really pull off some nice effects. beauty and the beast's famous dance sequence uses computer animation, but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie. the opening sequence was the best-looking part of the film, kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality. a little scene has multiple; i mean multiple similar shots of just a general's face, quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion.the kids might enjoy this flick, but with lack of dialog, song, and motivation, it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep. while disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals, they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one. bryan adams has no place in this movie, and why does hans zimmer stay away from using a western theme in this movie, when it is a story taking place in the old west? soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me. at least they are using realistic noises of horses, two points for that. yet, if you are going to refrain from making horses talk, why even have a narrator interrupt every so often, which just so happens to be the main character himself?native americans are nice, and the western folks are evil, native-killing, horse torturing, rowdy, psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed. more or less, this is what spirit is showing us. it reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the wild west; they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill, and another scene of them destroying an entire village of natives. now, the person spirit befriended happened to betray him, on more than one occasion, yet that is forgivable, apparently because he is not a soldier; that or because he has the sassy female horse.spirit isn't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for; the viewer is supposed to sympathize with spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk, wreaking havoc, and even perhaps resulting in some off-screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no, spirit is in trouble! this film gets quite rhythmic, as we see in multiple instances spirit escaping from chains, kicking people around, destroying property, freeing horses, and then getting captured again---all in this same order too. the writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie; for an old west film, they certainly have very little room to roam.bottom line: this is most certainly no disney movie, as a matter of fact that is a bad thing, even though it was what they were aiming for. so, instead of the typical musical, we get a boring film that becomes predictable, dull and slow in multiple instances. even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in. everything about this movie was just wrong; from the ideals that back then americans that were not native were evil buffoons, to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off. kill bill vol. 2, which pretty much has nothing to do with the old west, has more of a western feel than this movie. do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary. thank you.

(some possible spoilers) i'm not too sure what dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick. they probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (mostly families) to see it in droves. well it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made $26 mil., roughly and has made $38.1 mil. total (an estimation for this weekend). but i think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did, when i saw and they spread the word. this is one majorly lame movie, apart from the animation everything else, mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old. the movie is only about 80 mins. long, but it feels like a three hour epic. a few sticking points for me are, well the irritating narration is one of them, and it's so obviously written. at one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared, up pops the narrator (the voice of the talented matt damon) to clear up any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets. another one is the constant pop up of bryan adams songs, now i'm a fan of his music, i think he's good, but come on did dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs throughout such a short movie, i certainly couldn't. finally and here's a spoiler, a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river, spirit (the focus of the movie) tries to save her, but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop, well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. now i know this is a kids movie, but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable. to sum up, this is a really lame movie, i'm not saying kids won't enjoy it, but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end. definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year. -** out of 4 stars.

here's the good news first. "spirit" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. the artwork and effects are revolutionary, and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.and now for the bad news. i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. you may remember that "spirit" got badly trounced by "lilo and stitch" last summer. the first person who argues that it was because disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled "why 'lilo and stitch''s script didn't stink".for all the incredible new animation technology on display in "spirit", the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. there is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. you can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad film-making. simple as that. the animation is still mind-blowing; i just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.

it wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. combining dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named spirit (matt damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the old west. basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him. however when he escapes his cage, along with little creek (daniel studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for little creek's female horse. in the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by the colonel (james cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, little creek lets spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses. also starring chopper bernet as sgt. adams, jeff lebeau as murphy/railroad foreman, john rubano as soldier, richard mcgonagle as bill and matthew levin as joe. i was expecting to see the horses talk in this film, but it turns out to be more like a dumbo thing throughout, and the songs by bryan adams aren't the most engaging, but it isn't a terrible film. it was nominated the oscar for best animated feature, and it was nominated the golden globe for best song for bryan adams' "here i am". okay!

it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone, brian depalma, al pacino, and even michelle pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. it is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. this movie represents the worst of hollywood.what is this? is it based on a true story. well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today. but then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the american drug subculture; kind of like rocky on cocaine. is it a movie about cuba or cubans? for the life of me i don't believe there is a single cuban in this movie. the accents are totally fake, and scene with antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest american values. the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show. is this movie about miami? it looks more like l.a. transposed in florida. afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. is this a romance novel. the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. is this a drug movie? well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. admittedly, the acting is terrible.let's get to the rest. the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence welk show. i think i heard a polka? the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. clearly, the photography budget was excessive. the sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. the writing is appalling. this is one of those movies were the script writes itself. you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.so i am going to ask, is this even a movie? it could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. but at least a drama series has some kind of focus. maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. whatever it is, movie or not, it is a piece of crap.

spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii, or goodfellas. it is not in the same league.but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.ah well, the script ain't too hot either. don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the while.

i saw this movie in a theater in chicago and should have enjoyed it, since i love nemesis but if the first half an hour is skillfully done, the rest is just sub-predator video fodder, a long chase through those post-modern empty factories pyun affectionnates. my girlfriend fell asleep. i still like pyun though, but not this

naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task, candidates being so abundant, but nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since i saw it. it was so funny we had to rent it again the next day, and again i laughed so hard i was literally rolling on the floor. (this usually only happens when i see monty python's "scott of the antarctic".)throughout the whole movie, an overwhelming what-the-heck-feeling firmly grasps the viewer. i'm utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage. it's supposed to be a sequel, yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film. the hero has the same name, but this time "alex" is female, although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing, what with all the muscles and the barbarian-nomad outfit!there is really no plot at all, it's merely a prolonged chase scene, only it's so slow-paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is. there is almost no dialogue, which is just as well considering the quality of it, and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions, without ever really explaining what it was all about. luckily, it never gets boring, because there's something silly and phony going on at all times!terrible movies are usually just tedious, but nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over-seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining. rent this film, or buy it even, you won't be disappointed!

warning! spoilers!this is your typical disney film.1.policticly correct what with the foster home that has an even divison of races.2.insults the viewers intellect with its simplistic lines.3.the boy's slezy father is almost directly taken from the never ending story 2.4.in a world full of crime,disase,corruption,starvation and other proplems that need to be taken care of,only a losing team is worthy of divine intervention.ughhhh!!!5.did you know that angels don't like swearing?! where the heck did that come from!6.in helping the team,the angel cause pain and humilation on the opposing team.very angelic indeed!7.the team the angels are helping are called...can you guess...the angels! disney at its worst!8."just got his training wings." brillent line!my conculsion:i did not like it at all.

i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies - hey, no one wants to get typecast - but danny glover, brenda fricker (happy birthday, brenda!) and christopher lloyd should have known better than this. "angels in the outfield" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. do i even need to tell you how it ends? the movie is just plain lowly escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the '50s). if these movies had some political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be ok; this one is just pointless. far closer to diabolical than angelic. also starring tony danza, adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey, and i suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their resumes.

the movie seems disjointed and overall, poorly written. the screenplay moves along as if 10 different people wrote it, and none of them were communicating with each other. apparently they wanted to take a page from a miracle on 34th street (the original) type film, but it is done in such a poor way that the movie falls apart. this film is for only the very young, and even they will see the fact that whoever scripted it knows little to nothing about baseball. such as:  when the angels are in dead last place, the owner doesn't seem to care, nor is he bothered by the fact his manager just got into a fight with his pitcher  on the mound  or that he punched the team's play by play announcer on live tv. however, when the team is one game from winning the division, he gets bent out of shape over a story (sourced by a 6 year old) that the manager is getting help from a kid who claims to see real angels. what sounds worse? a losing violent out of control manager whose team has lost 15 in a row? or a winning coach on the verge of the playoffs that is acting a bit eccentric and is helping foster kids? the owner's reaction makes no sense. and he's moved to change his mind by maggie and her 'straight out of cliché land' speech during a news conference. the angels are supposed to be playing for the division in the final weekend series against the white sox, however at the end of the game the announcer's keep saying the angels 'won the pennant". the pennant is not decided until someone wins the league championship, not the regular season division title. whitt bass, the goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the angels losing streak  then is the starting pitcher  the very next day. mel clark (tony danza) is said in the ninth inning to have thrown 156 pitches, in a low-scoring ballgame. typically in low scoring games, the pitch count is much lower than this, usually around 80-90 pitches. "al" the angel says at the end "championships have to be won on their own", even though he and his angels have been manipulating and fixing games throughout the whole second half of the season.i could go on and on, as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written.for younger kids (under 10), this movie may be entertaining. it's too bad  done right this could have been a classic. done wrong like this and it's a forgettable mess that will forever live as a uhf/cable saturday morning washout.

this is a poor film by any standard. the story in match point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing a certain fascination (woody allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with it).scoop, however has none of this. it is poorly written, the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups (why are tarot cards and keys kept under french horns in locked rooms?).allen's delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres (curse of the jade scorpion/purple rose of cairo etc) have given us so much pleasure over the years. even hollywood ending had a great central idea. sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time.

err...this movie sucked. a lot.i have been reading some of the other reviews. apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically good...i have watched several of his films, in the vain hope that i'm missing something. but no, they just suck. poorly written trash. the characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention rather stupid). the plot is...i think it is supposed to be mysterious. not sure on that. mr. allen's character is...woody allen, on any other film you have seen of his.if you are a fan of woody allen, go see this film. if you are under 50, don't bother. (if you are a fan of woody allen and you are under 50...well, you are atypical. i don't know what to say.)

my wife and i both thought this film a watered-down, made-for-tv (bbc) version of manhattan murder mystery...which is itself good, but not great. the story has little inter- character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. woody allen's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth, and hugh jackman and scarlett johannsson don't have a lot more to do. it's pretty disappointing, i must say. ian mcshane's role is just an expanded cameo appearance. the first thing that occurred to me was "i wonder how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to dislodge him from manhatttan?" he must've needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars. i'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise. if you ever want something to have on while you're knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this'll do the job. i wouldn't pay to rent it again.

don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of many of woody's movies, obviously his late 70's masterpieces (annie hall,interiors, manhattan)and most of his late 80's/early 90's dramas (hannah, crimes and misdemeaners,husbands and wives) in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts (melinda, anything else, small time crooks) but this was abysmal, i though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i was.it was lazily plotted - basically a cross between match point, manhattan murder mystery and small time crooks,with all the jokes taken out - woody seems to be on the way out as well, slurring most of his lines and delivering 'hilarious' catchphrases 'i mean that with all due respect...' over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare.i know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first - scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this - and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future, if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it.it wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great woody films to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke.embarrassingly bad

warning! this review will reveal the ending of the movie, "scoop." if you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review!"scoop" is so bad you'll think "annie hall" was a fluke.it gets one star because you get to see hugh jackman's naked chest. that's the only thing "scoop" has going for it.woody allen's misogyny, and his fixation on women young enough, at this point, to be his granddaughter, has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point.the plot seems promising: a ghost, ian mcshane, directs a fluffy headed student, scarlett johansson, to investigate whether or not an english lord, hugh jackman, is the notorious tarot card killer of prostitutes. a magician, woody allen, helps the girl.promising plot notwithstanding, the movie completely lacks charm, or humor, or atmosphere. it's an amazingly leaden, amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film, never mind dozens. perhaps allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press.much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films, woody allen, now a septuagenarian, has finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl.not so. in fact, the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one.there is an early scene where johansson, for no reason central to the movie, allows herself to be gotten drunk, and seduced, by a powerful, older director. "seduced" is a euphemism for what happens. it's a "slam, bam, i've gotta go" kind of moment. it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever, and it cheapens johansson in the viewer's eye. why did allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? because it shows a powerful director - like allen - having sex with the female lead. allen gets to have his cake and eat it, too.johansson is not yet an actress. she doesn't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight, low cut top. she imitates allen in a couple of scenes, and that just looks weird and sad.it doesn't help that her character is scripted as a doll who can't function without a ghost, or an elderly and less than awe-inspiring magician, telling her what to do at every turn.she is approximately half jackman's age, and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together.audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines, and jackman deserves better, too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency, and an actress who can convey those qualities.hugh jackman is similarly cheated by the script. allen apparently can't stand it that jackman is so stunningly good looking and young, and so he gives jackman nothing to say or do. like johansson, he is used merely for his good looks. this is a shame, because, as jackman has shown in any number of productions, from "oklahoma" to "x men," he can act.here's the big plot twist -- jackman, suave, charming english lord, really is a killer. so, though the movie says it is all about letting someone else, other than allen, get the girl, she doesn't get anyone. jackman, the man she's been making love to, is a man who murdered a prostitute. nice, woody. nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp.in a passive aggressive touch, allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, as well, killing off his character, the magician, leaving scarlett johansson all alone at the end of the film.a final note: at my screening, not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film. always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy.

this show is just annoying!!! i feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny (especially bob saget), the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the "awwww" track comes up at the most unnecessary times. the over-dramatic kids are no exception, especially the olsen twins. also, this show is cliché city. if you were to look up the word cliché, it would read "full house" every story line has a "life lesson" to be learned at the end. a sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness gasp too bad this couldn't be possible in real life. i don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track. i find myself yelling at the tv saying, "that isn't funny/sad/cute" if life were really like this, the world would fall apart.

when i was younger, i liked this show, but now...blecch!!! this show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. the three leads were all good actors and funny men (saget's stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was coulier a better stand up, and stamos was a better than average actor). after a while, stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). the show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money.here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show:1. the catch phrases- how many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with 'how rude', 'you got it dude', 'nerdbomber', 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24 hour time period? 2. kimmy gibler- the most annoying character ever written for television.3. the writing- stale and cliched as an oreo cookie. there is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. full house had bad cliched writing.4. three men living together in san francisco- enough said.5. unrealistic stuff- too much to recall.6. trendy kids- the girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into.now this show is on nick @ nite. i would hardly call it a classic. i have nothing bad to say about the people involved since i think many of them are talented in their own right. but this show was just so sugary sweet, i couldn't stand it after a while.

i hated this crap, every friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week. if you want to see something funny go watch "no on would tell" starring candice cameron and fred savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show. this show really makes me sick, i hate those kids, and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. i've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. i ahet writing 10 lines! watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.

full house is one of the worst tv series ever! why?because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to bear.the best character is joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally.an that girl dj,who wrote her character?i want to kill my self every time she speaks.not to mention when danny start's with his philosophy.example: dj won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino.however,she's not eighteen so she shouldn't gamble according to law.however the casino was ready to pay her the money but then danny,her father cought's her and don't let's her raise that money because she is not eighteen.oh come on,give me a break,will ya?since i've seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television.some of the thing's they say in this series not even a child would bought.who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny?every single word they say in this series seem's like shakespeare wrote it.except that shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house! for everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world,i deeply recommend 'do not watch the full house'!not even one episode as a try out.avoid this series.save your self from stupidity and nonsense.this is the worst television show ever!i'd rather watch teletubbies then this.'do not watch this'.

if.... is the cinematic equivalent of sgt. pepper's: revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation, and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations. now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet, and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books/films, the relevance of if.... couldn't be further from modern concern. in fact, many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink floyd's the wall.one should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing, and the cemented date of this film aside, there are a few flaws which others have overlooked. lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis buñuel, on top of generally being too smart for his own good. and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts, the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism. anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over-intelligent cynicism, failing to see that buñuel was jovial in his work. i have not found a critic whom champions the 'chaplain in a drawer', and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film. the ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class/values system, as a wet slap on a moving target.the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes (the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors). and the modus operandi of if.... was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been unexplored in film, thereby savaging middle class pretense. homosexuality, generational cutlery, cold showers et al. in reality, such issues had been covered in many other great british films, if.... merely brought them to the fore. the browning version was a more oblique damning of such pomp, to name but one.if.... is oddly quaint, and simply can not be viewed with modern (especially american) eyes. kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and kieth in favour of african chant, and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones. points deducted for pretension, establishing characters who disappear, and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught.

ah, the spirit of '68. the streets of paris were running wild with rebellion, the hippies were high on the spirit of love. how was britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution? erm, by the looks of it, dear old blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools. if... contains the evil establishment. it contains the uprising of the oppressed. what it lacks in contrast to the parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement, except in its all-out ammo-and-artillery fire ending.lindsay anderson's if... stars the ever-marvellous malcolm mcdowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of lenin and other left-wing radicals. it's clearly an anti-establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper-class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish-posh public school standard. what makes if... unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies, it doesn't explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system, instead it just kind of floats: lacking in plot and lacking in personality.surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black-and-white to colour again (is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression?), but there is little of interest to speak of. all we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment. hooray! a revolution! at last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming.if... could have been a powerful political statement, but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end. instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late-sixties, it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper-class british education. anarchy? apathy more like, the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching if... will be lindsay anderson.

i've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict, british school in the 1960's to understand this. maybe that's true, if so, then this movie is outdated.*************spoiler alert**************************************** the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who're anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that doesn't torch society to a mad max type cinder.yeah, the main characters could leave, but they don't. the reasons they go about this don't make sense. there isn't enough character development to explain why. what shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at. it is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have, and it makes no sense.the characters who go on a murder spree aren't fighting the institution, they're just killing people. i thought they might've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, that would've made greater symbolic sense, but they didn't.tl;dr - this movie is an adolescent's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them, though in reality they need. it has no moral, symbolic truth, or meaning to it; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" that annoy you.if you think a murder rampage/ school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don't like, then i guess you'll love this movie. if you're like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against "the man", this movie is juvenile and boring.you can also tell in parts that funding was lacking, and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder.all in all, this seems like a very rough draft of what could've been an okay movie, but no effort is put into the dialogue, character development, or moral so it's just... poorly done.if... only i could get my two hours back.

the british public school system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconception.it was designed to produce administrators and governors,civil servants and military men to run the british colonies.these people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes.when the public schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the case.they tended to favour the schools nearer "town" so eton and harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent. the vast majority of public schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale.tom brown,perhaps the most famous public school pupil ever,was the son of a country parson,not a belted earl. thus in late 1960s england,a country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as harold wilson could slip off his "gannex" mac,lindsay anderson's "if" was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else. it must be remembered that the so-called "summer of love" was followed by the "october revolution" a non-event that left a few policemen in london with bruised heads and the u.s. embassy with one or two broken windows,but achieved absolutely nothing. so when mr anderson's film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as mr malcolm mcdowell's glorious victory over an amorphous "them" despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end,a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the u.s.embassy. the film told us nothing new about public schools,homosexuality,bullying cold showers,patrician sarcastic teachers,silly traditions.an all-too familiar list .it was declared to be an allegory comparing britain to the corrupt,crumbling society represented by the school.well,nearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishing,the british social system has not changed,the "october revolution" has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and mr anderson has completed his "state of the country" trilogy to no effect whatsoever. if by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than mr mcdowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the tale,find a copy of "stalky & co."written by the man whose much-maligned poem "if" lent it's name to mr anderson's film,a man born in colonial india,a man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary history.and do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non-person.perhaps somebody should start a revolution about that.

this is an extremely boring film. if you grew up during the vietnam was, as i did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood. the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.if you're old enough to remember vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam. younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler's excellent film going upriver! stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal.

from the start, you know how this movie will end. it's so full of clichés your typical nra member will not even like this movie. i give it 2 out of 10, only because of the acting of william benton. i can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. it's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief...). people aren't born bad. neither are they born good. they are born with a clean slate. it's society, parents and education what makes them who they are. and if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track! anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap.

rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly. griffin dunne, rosanna arquette, illeana douglas, ethan hawke, dennis hopper, christopher walken, and john turturro, all jumped on board, only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke. attaching martin scorsese's name to this was probably the draw, but the end result is way less than the sum of it's parts. resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong, each scene seems more contrived than the next. "search and destroy" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self indulgent nonsense, and the entire film is decidedly dull.......... merk

the cat o'nine tails (il gatto a nove code) aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (cromoscope)sound format: mono(35mm and 70mm release prints)a blind ex-journalist (karl malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (james franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage (1969), dario argento conceived the cat o'nine tails as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton (1969) - and rising star franciscus (the valley of gwangi). sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than "bird" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.malden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer enrico menczer (the dead are alive) uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak (the libertine) as franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. but despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. it's no surprise that "cat" failed to emulate the runaway success of "bird" when released in 1971.(english version)

while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works, this slow-moving, repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half, but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement.to be sure, the actors are above average - considering this is an argento movie - and some moments show the director's visual skills, but whole sequences should've been cut and, basically, it's just the same exploitative trash as ever, wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity.3 out of 10 genetic disorders

few films have left me with such a feeling of unease, and this is not a compliment. since i saw it in a theater (how it ended there i can only wonder) i was subjected to 90 mn of hateful, derivative garbage, the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie "don't answer the phone" - but worse. the nastiness of it all, rape and all, is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like "last house on the left") and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. at the end i felt like taking a shower. no credits to the director

there is one really good scene in faat kine. the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened, faat kine sprays her in the face. the scene works because the act is so unexpected, bizarre, and rather funny at the same time. in that one instance, writer/director ousmane sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for, an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours. in the scene, he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions. for the rest of the movie, the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones. the tone is all over the place. it's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre, but i don't think faat kine fits into any genre. supposedly, it's a drama, though there are moments of such broad comedy (the aforementioned spraying in the face) that it cannot be taken seriously. on the other hand, the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics sembene has crammed into the picture. there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together. unfortunately, semebene doesn't find that balance. instead, one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason, leaving two different tones hanging in the wind. faat kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale. the film ends with a big party where all the characters' conflicts are resolved, only they aren't resolved quickly. the scene lasts longer than any other scene, going on for probably twenty minutes. because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering, the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene, making for a frustrating viewing experience.perhaps i am being too hard on faat kine. i am not the right audience for it. i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story. there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. however, i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it.

this movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life. nothing exciting ever happens. the director has really "kept it real" and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life. i had to watch other films by this director for a class, the others were not as boring. this film was also watched for an assignment...it better be worth the boringness with a good grade!! overall, unless it's required, don't watch the film. but don't discount other films by this director, because they're not as bad...and don't discount other films about africa, they're usually good, especially when done by a western director.

...through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze. a not-particularly talented director has helmed a not-particularly good movie, yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits, if for nothing more than to see what happens next.a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame. after capturing her (even though she came willingly) and threatening her into having sex (another event she was also willing to do) he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past. he then decides to kill her (huh?) but is foiled and dies instead. the girl's mind snaps (or something like that) and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement.alright, the writing sucks: it's long winded, loaded with ten-cent words and there is way too much of it.the acting sucks: what a minute, what acting? the filming sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult.and the budget is a joke: get it...'budget', that was the punchline.and yet there was a charm to the thing. back in the 70's these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them, not in this day and age though. if you want to watch this kind of violent, sexually exploitive trash (don't lie, some of us do) then this is all your gonna get nowadays.some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene, torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu.it's not good and it won't be remembered, but not since the heyday of joe d'amato have people made movies like this.4/10

in director eric stanze's 'isoyc, ipoyg', three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused. the first victim is forced to eat his own crap, before being axed to death. the next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy's corpse. but it's the third man who gets it the worst: he has to watch the heavily tattooed 'star' emily haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle (oh, he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too!).and, unfortunately, so do we (get to see her masturbate, that isnot get a broom handle up our butts!).yes, 'isoyc, ipoyg' is one harsh viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because haack, who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess (as opposed to that of a roadie for metallica) constantly gets buck naked for the camera. it ain't a pretty sight.in addition to the non-stop nudity from an inked-up haack, viewers also get to see dreadful direction from stanze (who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff), some really bad acting, and a fat guy's penis.strangely enough, i give 'isoyc, ipoyg' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. that's one point for the messy axe attack (which, being a gore-hound, i actually enjoyed); one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces (hilarious); and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to meir zarchi's superior exploitation classic i spit on your grave.

am i wrong,or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever seen.....bad acting,bad editing etc....the only "exploitation " aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap. it is nothing more than a light-weight porn flick...no real gore, no scary images, just a cheaply done bit of garbage. if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors,some slimy gore and a decent storyline...get baby blood...also done on a cheap budget but well made...and an actual story too!i spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a laugh....it is pathetic! new comment....sept 3.....i'll keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it's almost good....in a really bad way....the worst acting ever...a real crap-movie classic!

with a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me. granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse "shock" tactics... the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. he and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. the heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a "grabby" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. he explains to her that he is going to kill them all. she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. the best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... surely, "i spit on your corpse, i p!ss on your grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "i spit on your grave" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was camille keaton. i personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! this movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably...

good lord! (and that coming from an atheist), this "movie" is bad !much has already been said by the reviewers before (the ones who rated this piece 3 and below) to which i fully agree, i just like to add a few things: among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button).had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes.the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are emily haack's tits (one point).forget it. don't buy it. don't waste your time. and your sanity. my brain is so fried after watching this i feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?) "scrapbook" right now.

picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film, throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting, and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is.shot badly, bad effects, worse acting. contrived attempt at shocking horror. everyone i've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it. the sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible. the last sex scene is just foul, even before she gets to the guy.i'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate, which is why i picked this one up. but for your own sake, save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence. it's that bad. i literally threw it in the garbage.

a young man kills a young woman for no reason. the man's brother is jailed on charges that he was an accomplice, but soon escapes. upon escaping, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon he ropes his girlfriend in on the plot. if this isn't bad enough, the situation quickly makes a downward spiral.this film had some good aspects and many bad ones. its strongest aspect was lead actress emily haack. setting aside the fact she's nude in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. i see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way. i was convinced she was a ruthless individual.also, the makers of this film were very bold and pulled no punches. graphic nudity (both male and female), coprophagia, and extreme anal violence are not shied away from. i like my horror films to push the boundaries a little bit, and this one ignored them altogether, gladly skipping towards gomorrah. maybe it was too much, but i think they achieved what they were looking for.but now the negative aspects. first, and most noticeable, this film is very low budget and the film quality shows this. i can excuse that -- the plot was decent, the acting fine and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the movie more disturbing (a more realistic feel). so, i won't scold them for having low-grade equipment. what i will scold them for is the use of poor choices in shots. for no reason i can ascertain (besides plumping the movie), there is a large amount of footage of a cemetery. i don't really know why, and i frankly started dozing off at this point because it was so long and pointless.i also take issue with the title. the idea here was to deceive people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic "i spit on your grave". now, there is a line that seems to imply the main character is the daughter of the woman from this other film. and the themes are very loosely the same (a woman getting revenge on men). but there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was for the video store customer to think they were getting a sequel. this was deceptive and dishonest.my last major complaint is that this plot makes no real sense. not even a little bit. a woman is killed in the beginning for no reason. a prison escapee finds time to kidnap people to torture them, for no reason (because they wronged his girlfriend?). the same man goes from good to very evil without explanation. likewise, the female lead (haack) turns fro ma normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, for no reason at all, and against people who for the most part were only marginally mean to her (a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong, but by no means worth getting tortured for).don't let this title fool you, or the claims that the film is incredibly shocking. yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film is dull and makes you want to take a nap. if you see this in the video store or on netflix, just keep browsing. or rent it, and we can sit around and vent about it for hours. you have been warned.

i watch bad movies.this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent throughout.i am lazy.usually, i see a bad movie and curse. this was so bad, i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to.i am smashing my copy of this movie.it's too lame even to use clear a room. so boring. watch 'bloodsucking freaks' or 'shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment. this sludge looks awful, is awful, and whoever made it should feel awful.

no spoilers.i love horror movies, but this has got to be the poorest attempt to make one ever. calling it "a movie" is also a stretch. this "random-clips-of-obviously-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-an-ugly- woman-trying-to-act-sexy-edited-poorly-together" is not worth watching.watching this is about as interesting watching as some random family's holiday pictures, and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new vid-cam, and tell him to make a movie.terrible.

i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie ( its kinda of a mini porno) . it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder. if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all. i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 . i want be watching it again at all. the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie.

i'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad, i felt embarrassed for not only the "actors", but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock.from the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog. instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode. at least i laugh at the three stooges. while watching this crap, i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened.needless to say, i kept watching stern.watching this "film" i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 dv cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc. this film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action. this makes "kazaam" look like a meryl streep film.i'm sure germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence. other countries need to take heed.

this subject matter deserves a much better script, and final result, than this movie serves up. the script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together. the gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous. the scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is just bizarre. it is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a "missing poster" from when she was eight. in the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, under his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police. it's a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for oprah. everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift that i can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation. funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. in the end it seems to have joined in.

what do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are excruciatingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? you get jessica: a ghost story seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. in this case it does not. there are a few cu's where the person's face is entirely in shadow. one scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists. it's a joke if you ask me. some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half... but i guess then they wouldn't have a film at feature length. the main character is incredibly flat. he's the lead male, so he should have some "hero" elements to his character, but he does not. he whines and is scared the entire film. i could go on, but i don't want to waste my time. although the lighting was terrible, i must say that they did have nice camera movement. too bad the lighting didn't compliment it. the cover of the dvd is nice, and that's where it ends. just terrible.

jessica: a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story. the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy!a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot. there is really nothing more to it. the movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death.immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of a "straight-to-dvd" effort. unlike gems such as vacancy 2, the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives "straight-to-dvd" movies a bad name! the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense, scares or tension. even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring.the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career.many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. i'm not exaggerating!the only reason i give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs. i stress the word "few" in that sentence. this is not overall one of the "so-bad-it's-good" movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre. if you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house, the changeling, ringu, the eye (original korean version), the grudge, one missed call or phone.i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica: a ghost story to keep up the good work! just forget this movie exists. don't spare a thought for it!

i bought a dvd of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. the movie was shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a pbs special about it. the special effects are phoney looking, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat. there is a particularly effective scare involving a virgin mary statue.however, the acting is bad, the "plot" scenes are long and very boring, and i will tell you i have no clue what happened at the end. if you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $5.

this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like, but i didn't. it seemed to be trying way too hard to be 'artsy'. all flash, with no content. it has some beautiful scenes, and any one of them are nice to watch, but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it. i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton, and the fact that i'm a big shakespeare fan, but i was very disappointed. i just found it a bit pretentious and, at times, boring.

this is not the worst film i have seen of peter greenaway but it is close. that dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book. this director's films of 3 i have seen i find them all to be miserable. like the cook...,whatever positive cinematic flourishes he displays, are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation.

this film was just painful to watch... not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations (yeah, i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along), but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours. now, you all may think i'm just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or "artistic film-making"... well, you'd be wrong on both counts. i love the works of shakespeare, especially the tragedies of romeo and juliet, julius caesar, macbeth, and hamlet, and i've watched plenty of "arthouse" films such as the surreal and well-made eraserhead and fellini's 8 1/2... but this was just over two hours of lost-in-translation shakespeare, way too much nudity (i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes... but not in every other shot of a movie!!! it was pointless and served nothing for the story!!!), and basically just overzealous film-making. i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of shakespeare's the tempest... but this was just an extreme letdown. i gave this film a three only because of sir john gielgud's acting presence (which far surpassed all of the no-names in this film) and the cinematography/set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion... however, a lot of this film would've been better off as just a painting with a scroll of text below it. a true disappointment... maybe if zeffirelli had been given the director's chair, this would've been much better. but this is one audience member's opinion, many others may enjoy this far more than me. that being said, if you can't find this at any nearby video stores (it's currently not on dvd), don't try to go too far out of your way to find it... it's not really worth it.

motocrossed was fun, but it wasn't that great. i guess i just didn't understand a lot of the motocross racing "lingo" (and there was a lot of that in the film)! the plot wasn't what i expected from the disney channel previews, so that could account for some of my disappointment.

although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front, this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary. this depicts the funnest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times.when we finally see some battle, it is lame: an enemy plane flies over? shoot it down (in one shot). sniper in the tree? kill him before he gets a shot off. enemy soldiers in the woods? not to worry, they gladly surrender. ho-hum.tepid, turgid, predictable...

'nobody knows anybody' is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist/nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week. he also happens to be the best friend of the film's hero. the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game, with himself and the hero as players, and seville as the virtual environment. the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman-type games. looked at this way, the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black-hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays. from the start, we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game - the hero's job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper; at one point, the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend's father. clues are liberally scattered, as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant (e.g. the advert in the bar). the detective/paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress, rather than an investigation after the fact. the film borrows heavily on 'se7en''s pattern narrative, and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter.in this reading, the game is on the level of narrative, with the hero fighting against an enemy (in this case, the computer) to win and save the day. but there is a second game, the film itself, which subvert the first. there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer's intentions, but the filmmaker's and his hero's. in the first ten minutes there are references to chess, a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin. if we remember that the chess-loving nabokov's 1930s pseudonym was sirin, we see another game afoot, one where we suspect not the villain, but the hero himself. in a nabokov novel like 'pale fire', an author-figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives, provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text. throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted (e.g. the image contracting), or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero's point of view. the opening references to games are all linked to him. in the early sequences, much is made of the character's sexual and creative impotence, so the film could be his attempt to master his life, to be a winner, in a way he can't for real. no sooner has he won the game than his writer's block vanishes; the words he types are the title of the film, suggesting he is the overall author. further, that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively, a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero, like kinbote, trapped in his own solecism.this jumble of post-modern literature (borges, eco, pynchon et al are alluded to also), fincher, 'x-files', 'run lola run', chris marker (the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text; and as a cultural history haunting the present), bunuellian anti-clericism, and alex de la iglesia's 'shock' films result in a film that is just that, a jumble, each clever-clever allusive element cancelling out the last, dissipating interest. the lack of clarity about the game's rules renders it incomprehensible, and eventually wearing. ironically, in a work of such overdetermined artifice, the film's main interest lies in its documentary quality, as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently. such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like 'sans soleil' or 'london', but, ultimately, you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness.

holy crap! what a terrible, terrible spanish thriller! i've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night. i watched an hour or so before heading to bed. i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing. i finished it last night and couldn't believe where i stopped it the night before. literally, i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill.like i said, i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar. i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a "menacing" game of laser tag. whew! then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds. whew! you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil (co-writer of amenabar's two big previous hits). there is an excellent score and great photography. but this scenario reeks of silliness. how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.

absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by amenabar's usual collaborator mateo gil. the film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers none, and seems like an exercise in boredom. the only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100-plus minutes, and is resolved too simply. the plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). the hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. if you're fans of the genre, watch "tesis" instead.

the above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit erotic,scary, suspenseful, well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.it is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies i have seen in recent years. and yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like santa claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. this made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through america creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. and yet there's only four zombies in the entire film. another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. in fact i believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.in fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. and so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst i assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels "editing isn't a hard job anyway right?" the only reason this "movie" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with freddy vs jason, strange how these things happen isn't it. and the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.oh yes we did laugh at the end, but i'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen!!!! i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this one!!!and i mean never!!!!i'm a big fan of "b" horror movies. as you may imagine.... i've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer.i was lured to this movie by it's title. i mean c'mon... what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like "vampires vs. zombies"??? images of the "undead" battling each other to the "undeath" danced in my head. i thought to myself... "this i've got to see"!!!!well.... sorry to say.... "this i wish i hadn't seen"!!!!!this movies title is very misleading to say the least. there was no vampires fighting zombies. in fact, there is no plot!!!! if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no idea!!!there was no plot!!!! there was no story!!!! this movie absolutely makes no sense at all!!!!at the end of this debacle... i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense!!!

in this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade-z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. the plot, and i use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with "the general," whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter. i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. anyone older beware.

this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot. aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. the movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. it's now a running joke among my friends and i. 1 out of 10.

a stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to say the least) dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget.the characters aren't believable, in their motives, actions or their professed occupations. the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons(tm) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields. there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, wincing. avoid it like the plague. watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting, dialogue and plot. yuck.

if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie, then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you'll never get back. i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re. first, a "special" commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection. and this "hive" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time. there's even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the dialog of re. despite the fact that there are no zombies, the "rook", the movie's nemesis, is some sort of bio-creature, very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re. so, a wag-of-the-finger to mr. richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story.they are not the same movie obviously, but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think.

i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. the fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut.it's watchable, but barely so. there are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres. once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that. huh? vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. but that's not saying much.

what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. they must eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after a poison war, or something, has nearly wiped out all human civilization. in these dark times, one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort, we will call him the all knowing big boss, has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air. it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist. the spores are located far away from any living soul, and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. so, he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location. sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air. how about letting sleeping dogs lie?! the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu. as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing, engaging vivian wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much. she is an object of love, an object of desire -- a very believable concept!fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b-movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush. dinner rush is highly recommended. encrypt is not.

it's not the most well made slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty amusing. the plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. i have to be honest, if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film, you wont find this film as funny as those who do. i knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour, in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. it's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills,most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch, drink and be merry!

i just finished watching this movie. i was very excited since i'm a big fan of punk rock, horror films and spoofs. i was very surprised at what i saw. i knew it was low budget, but i wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera. it opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, the horrorpops, reforming their song, where they wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. it's a great opening. but the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. a live performance, a death. another live performance, a death. it gets old. and there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. why doesn't the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. like the hardcore french band, known simply as beret, the prospect of a band named atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and bowling for soup's overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that i will save for the future watchers of this movie. but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the "actors". especially warped tour creator, kevin lyman. he tries very hard, but i suspect that he didn't want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something. in addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd. the movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil. bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror, music, or comedy film. although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to, otherwise. such as tsunami bomb, and the phenomonauts(an insane, psychobilly band). i recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on. if not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances. they rock! long live punk rock and horror!

well, if you like pop/punk, punk, ska, and a tad bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching. this movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with president of troma, lloyd kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of goofy death scenes. sounds like it may be good, right? well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event. some of the deaths start of stylish, but then they are recycled over and over, to the point of being completely repetitive. almost everyone dies of having their head smashed, or intestines being pulled from their stomach. the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas' "zombie 90: extreme pestilence"; with this being the "watered-down type blood", but now that movie is actually decent, and provides humor-something that this movie terribly lacks. sure, the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma, it's got great low-budget potential, and it tries...but just too hard. everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie, and thats what brings it down. everything tries to be too comic and goofy, by using intentional bad acting, an overuse of pointless deaths, and doing the same thing...over and over. it's basically "mulva: zombie ass-kicker", "chairman of the board", or any movie you have made with your friends: it's funny to those who made it, and that's about it.great potential, great idea, great use of effects-but it's the same thing...over and over: a band plays, a band dies, fans die. everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated.the question is for these types of movies-which is basically 'bad slap-stick'-do they try too hard, or not at all?

judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic, many places ridiculousone wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife? when he earns so much just to show how poor he is?the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny- paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny, paresh irritates farida is decent

i remembered this show from when i was a kid. i couldn't remember too much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. for some reason i remembered it being really intense. also it was on really really early in the morning up in pa. i finally, after looking around the web for a long time, found an episode. the first episode no-less. criminey! this show was so horrible. it was obviously just made to show kids playing lazer tag and having a great time. the show opens with bhodi li telling his mommy "my names not christopher, i'm bhodi li-photon warrior!!!!!" we then are forced to watch kids playing lazer tag to the song "foot loose". and not just a quick little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yeah, and as if i couldn't get worse, you cant even see the laser beams from their guns. its like they're just running around to the entire "foot loose" song. later on, after bhodi goes up into space or where-ever, they have a crappy laser gun fight to the phil collins song "su-su-sudio." ah, trust me, you don't want to know the rest. what can i say......the light shines!!!!!!!!!!!

sometimes a premise starts out good, but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder, it devolves into an incongruous mess. and for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after, this is a mortal shame.so let's see. premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop. interesting to say the least. make the encroaching cop a little disturbing, why not. it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female, and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.now herein lies the dilemma. create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous, or throw any semblance to reality, amp up the shock factor, and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age.the producers, and directors, chose the latter. thus is the resulting film -- badly made, with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before, and nothing much amounting to even less.

this is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of hollywood dreck.kurt russell, as snake pliskin in a business suit, convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman. ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self, and does little to be a convincing victim.every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace, and everybody--- except russell and stowe, knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again.he does, of course, and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm, which was entirely unnecessary. this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene--- except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "enhance", the more slobbery they get.

typical thriller, has been done many times before. simple plot outline; cop liotta becomes obsessed with russell's wife, and he tries to bump off good ol' kurt so he can have her. this is beyond predictable, it doesn't even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there's no thinking outside the box here. i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. there's not really anything to say about this film, it's not particularly bad, but there's no good points either. russell plays russell and you know what you're gonna get when you see him in a film. ditto liotta. stowe has an annoying cher-esque voice. i read the plot outline and i could see the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. i watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as i had imagined. i felt not a drop of emotion throughout. i have no feeling towards this film, it's as if i never even watched it. considering this, it's a pretty pointless film isn't it? still, i'll give it 3/10 for some reason.

these kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. fatal attraction, pacific heights, the hand that rocks the cradle, single white female, and a thousand made-for-tv movies are some examples of this. but while a few, especially fatal attraction and pacific heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, unlawful entry plays everything by the book. and were it not for the notoriety of its stars (kurt russel, ray liota, and madeline stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a danielle steele miniseries.russel plays michael carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (madeline stowe). unfortunately, he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (ray liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. at first empathizing with carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. but soon enough, the cops wants carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife. it seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. the wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. and the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. from the "shocking" moment our main, naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.

there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie. which is a prequel to the tv show, that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment. both before david lynches disgusting style of story telling, and after. from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach. and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the twin peaks.to the mind numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie twin peak:fire come walk with me. i watched it all just to make sure i wasn't missing anything. i didn't. it's is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie. save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story, rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie.i have heard a lot of reviews, rants and raves about how great david lynch. because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing. this is not life imitating art, as much as it is some sick twisted version of art doing its best to inspire complete mindless life.do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.

we are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. we may confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confess, that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear, that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real concept.well, obviously many people like such stuff. i don't. i prefer well thought and planed shows. and i also confess, that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring...those love and drug stories...there are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense (dallas e.g.), but twin peaks can't catch my attention. i don't care about those people, except cooper and gordon cole.

i can't understand why so many peoples praised this show. twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my life.now i have seen all season 1 episodes, and seeing season 2 episode 1. simply i can't take this show anymore.1) where is the proper induction in criminal investigation?in season 1, there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle. can you guess why he did that? he just want to identify murderer by doing this 'joke' while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream. wow!!!2) there are too many unnecessary scenes in this show.for example, season 2 started with a 'funny' scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor.( he got the gun shoots in his belly already. ) this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments. that's all.this scene is really boring and even long ( 3 min 30 sec.... it's like hell. )i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore.

this overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. i am not quite sure what they mean by "ground-breaking" and "original" when they fawn all over lynch and his silly little tv opus. what exactly is their criteria of what is original? sure, compared to the "bill cosby show" or "hill street blues" it's original. definitely. next to "law & order" tp spews originality left and right.fans of tp often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough, open enough for the show's supposed "weirdness", its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. as a fan of weirdness myself, i have to correct that misconception. there is nothing too off-the-wall about tp; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. the supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time. there's a difference...whenever i watch the "weird dream" sequence in "living in oblivion" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let's-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene cliché, i think of lynch. you want weird? "eraserhead" is weird - in fact, it's beyond weird, it's basically abstract. you want a unique tv show? watch "the prisoner". you want a strange-looking cast? felini's and leone's films offer that. tp looks like an overly coiffed tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. the cast gives tp a plastic look. kens & barbies en masse.in fact, one of the producers of tp said that lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. unique faces? like lara flynn boyle's? sheryll fenn's? like those effeminate-faced "hunks" straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like fenn (the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but then don't go around saying you're making a "weird show with weird-looking people". and i have never understood lynch's misguided fascination with kyle maclachlan (i should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right). he is not unlikable, but lacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. his character's laughable "eccentricities" were not at all interesting, merely one of lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge but that time. everything lynch made post-"elephant man" was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies. what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny. in other words, lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling. so laura palmer was killed by her dad...? he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense. that's the best this "great mind" could come up with... you've got b-movie horror films that end with more originality. lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific story.go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~fedor8, and check out my "tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism" list.

veteran director and producer allan dwan, whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown (for example, john wayne in "sands of iwo jima") tried his hand at a big musical with "i dream of jeanie." harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and, as it turned out, virtually no future, he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great american songwriter, stephen foster.bill shirley is the young, lovestruck foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy. his intended is inez mcdowell (muriel lawrence) whose pesky younger sister, jeanie (eileen christy), is slowly realizing she's in love with the nearly impecunious song-smith. foster is in love with inez who is revolted by the composer's number 1 on the levee hit parade tune, "o susannah." enter minstrel edwin p.christy (ray middleton) to help launch the profit-making phase of foster's career.this is, by the musical-film standards of the early fifties, a big production. the sets are lavish in that special hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. the singers aren't half bad and the foster songs are almost impossible to ruin.but this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum south. the biggest number features black-face for all on stage, an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism. were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality, the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution."i dream of jeanie" apparently sank into the studio's vault with barely a death whisper. now revived by alpha video for a mere $4.99 it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of america's great crime, slavery.this was what hollywood was putting out two years before brown v. board of education. must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater.

just picked up this film for a buck at national wholesale liquidators, and after watching it, i feel like i got ripped-off.i don't know that i've seen a worse film than this. honestly. and i would never write a negative review of a film had i not such enormous respect for the subject matter, that is, stephen foster and his music.first, what is it? it's a musical biography? yeah, lot's of tunes by foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-broadway-jerome kern-type numbers that reek more than the mississippi delta. i mean, somebody got paid to write this drivel? secondly, the real story of foster is a fascinating one. why not even come close to it? thirdly, what did they have on the great ray middleton to get him to do this film? pictures of him with small boys?? with communists? what a waste of a great talent.so, friends of foster, and the truth, and good entertainment, be afraid... be very, very, afraid.

i found a dvd of "i dream of jeanie" in the $1.00 bin at wal-mart. when i saw that it was the "story of stephen foster", being a musician and music educator, i had to see it. i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover, just that it was a remake of 1939's "sewanee river". bill shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs...without paying him for them! in addition to that ridiculous notion, there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his black-faced "christy minstrels" performing stephen foster's songs that was difficult to watch, to say the least. i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time. it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten. fortunately, stephen foster's songs will never be forgotten....also, eileen christy's portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history.

this must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: not recommended to normal people.the obsession of daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare. also, it's evident that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everybody - his country his people, his actors, his job. and this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago.this so called "film" is just a hideous string of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge. it is an insult to good taste and to good sense. shame, shame, shame!

this movie can be labeled as a study case. it's not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and non-artistic lust for anything that might be termed as caco-imagery. the author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills ("moldavia is the most pauper region of europe", "i don't believe one iota in the birds flu", "romanian people steal because they are poor; europeans steal because they are thieves") are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude - but he is sorely off-target! what daneliuc doesn't know, is that it's not enough to pose as a righteous person - you also need a modicum of professionalism, talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product. fatefully, "the foreign legion" shows as much acumen as a family video with uncle gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guests. the script is chaotic and incoherent, randomly bustling together sundry half-subjects, in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story. the direction is pathetically dilettante - the so-called "director" is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise-en-scene, his shots are annoyingly awkward, and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence. (of course, any comment is forced to stop at this level; it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as "cinematographic language", "means of expression" or "style"). the acting is positively "cântarea româniei" ("romania's chant") level, with the exception of... paradoxically, the soccer goal-keeper necula raducanu, who is very natural, and nicodim ungureanu. oana piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness, but she is compromised by the amateurish directions given by daneliuc.the most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget, via c.n.c. (the national cinematography council). the fact that long-time-dead old dinosaurs like daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable (in a market-driven economy, they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection). but the corruption of the so-called "jury" that squanders the country's money on such ridiculously scabrous non-art, non-cinema and non-culture belongs to the criminal field.

i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go. one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies, and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable. this is not cinema, friends and neighbors! this is simply visual perversion. forget about bunuels chien andalou, about david lynch, about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness. those people were mastering their jobs - well, you don't! do us a favor, all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old-timers, and leave us alone! its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms! you are not directors, you are illiterate!!!

sadly, it's true. "legiunea sträinä" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliuc's irreversible failure.as it was already said, the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy, he only gathers a disordered pile of events, unable to follow the least story-line. the script's level is similar to a "cântarea româniei" amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only, turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism, now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. the ideas content is zero, and the "message", infantile and didactic, at a kindergarten level.unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. he isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation, to order it in a correct movie scene, to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. his level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: "holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere, and all da people is asses!" what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who had created unique works as "cursa", "proba de microfon", "vânätoarea de vulpi" - and even "croaziera" and "glissando"... sic transit gloria mundi...

jason lee's pecks are back! if that's what you are looking for, look no further. if not, better move on...but about the movie. clichés galore, some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes (used jkd) and lots of bad acting & cheap effects. poor lee looks like he's in pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. not a pleasant comeback.the movie doesn't even cut it as a b-movie - sure, there was a germanish bleached blonde rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots. none. zip. nada. even in starship troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes (as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence, please refer to our upcoming review on that mind-blowing sequel...). i did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this - thus i won't get into the "plot" of the movie or pretty much anything else related. except that it did have some non-heterosexual overtones, so 'nuff said.however, this movie has one thing going for it - no jean-claude :)

if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film, i recommend the following:dragon: the bruce lee storyrapa nui"timecop 2: the berlin decision" is an awful film. awful production values. awful acting. awful script. i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood (this film does neither.).i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing. if you are curious, perhaps a rental from netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness, and came away disappointed, then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing. these are well-written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors:better luck tomorrow mulan

this is pretty much the first jason scott lee film i've seen. i say pretty much, because i have also seen soldier, in which he plays the villain... but from what i've heard, it's not considered a jason scott lee film. this, however, is. and if this is any indication of the quality of such films, i won't be seeing any of the others. lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead, he's awful. he gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film, probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. the villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane, he barely seems like a villain at all. the majority of the film is basically lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it's the other way around. i can't say for sure... and i definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure. the effects are not completely horrible... but it's close. the title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill hitler. somehow, the film screws up that interesting idea as well. the plot is too complicated for its own good. the pacing is poor. i can't think of one positive thing to say about this film... i really can't. it's simply too formulaic and pointless. if only i had a time-machine, so i could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no, never mind. i just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. listen to the negative reviewers. avoid this turkey. i recommend this to fans of lee, and no one else. if you're looking for a quality film... well, this isn't it. that's for sure. 1/10

i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged. the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform. her humour is also to be appreciated. she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage. however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. can't say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed. all said apart from ariauna's performance it is indeed utter trash.

ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery. what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom. the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician. this was a production that cried out for some t & a & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things. however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation. the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & t & a. nough said.

way back when, the x-files was an intelligent, thought-provoking show. a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas, tying the plot to the spooky side of real life.i was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired. the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on ("one son" and "requiem"), and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were far-fetched, implausible, or downright silly. but i figured, hey, give it the benefit of a doubt, maybe they're bringing it back because they've got some great ideas lined up."roadrunners" really was upsetting. following "patience", which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid, the episode sees a strange (alien?) parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods christians. oh, and they think it's the second coming of christ, but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes. seriously. there's never *any* attempt to make sense of this, to explain what the slug is, why anything that's happening is happening, or anything. even in the show's early years - in fact, *especially* then - you could expect a little bit more depth, a bit of background, or if not that then the opposite - a bit of mystery, some uncertainty about what this was all about. it's scully that really kills it though. you could put up with the silliness of the premise, but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch. you feel like you're watching some godawful teen horror, except that it's a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she's spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of, being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety. oh, and by the way, doggett, the new mudler, isn't around. scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him. he shows up at the end to save the day - i can't even remember why - but apart from that, he's not really in it. again: seriously.in short, it feels like either a generic script written for another show, or someone's pet movie project which they've been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing, long-running show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable. it might've worked on a lesser show, where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less. but the x-files had a good thing going, and scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic tv characters of the 90s. deciding that you're going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they must've done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless.

one of boris karloff's real clinkers. essentially the dying karloff (looking about 120 years older than he was)is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies. moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories. desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying. she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo (who i think is married). if you think i got that from watching the movie you're wrong, i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened. why? because this movie had me lost from two minutes in.i had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines. little is spelled out and much isn't said until towards the end by which time i really didn't care. its a dull mess of interest purely for karloff's performance which is rather odd at times. to be honest this is the only time i've ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory. its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out.

this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha, and it's for die-hard boris karloff fans (like moi) only. it's not a horror flick, but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work. but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing, all hell breaks loose.it's appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type, and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious (especially from the leading lady mona goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double-crossed wife).but proceed with much caution.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** juggernaut is a british made "thriller" released in the us by first national. karloff is dr. sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. karloff is forced to retreat to france and start up a medical practice. he is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. she knows karloff needs the money.karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband. all the while, the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy. karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off. however, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed. when he spills the beans to the wife, she goes berserk and even bites the son's hand.meanwhile, karloff's nurse has misplaced the hypo karloff used to kill the old man. when karloff finds out he isn't getting any money, he asks the wife to poison the son. the nurse suspects karloff and finds the missing hypo. analysis shows poison, but not quite in time as karloff kidnaps the nurse.to make a long story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by karloff. karloff instead injects himself and dies.this movie does have some good points. karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in the devil commands and the man who lived again. it is peculiar, however, to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over. we never find out why he is walking this way. i suspect the director thought it made him more sinister.the actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible. she has a french accent. even though she overacts badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting...).a little below average for a karloff vehicle. if you buy the sinister cinema vhs copy, the audio is a bit choppy.

this movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end. as a don knotts vehicle, "the incredible mr. limpet" was much better, with knott's character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. his performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as bob denver did. neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. it was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice. john ritter, whom knotts worked with in "three's company," was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like "the dreamer of oz," but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in "pleasantville." even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in "airplane!" and "police squad."there's also no way the then-43 year-old knotts could pass for a 35 year-old, as his character insisted he was. it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at 38 playing the college-age forrest gump.the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastily-filmed tv episode. it's especially evident in the "exterior" scenes of the "town" where roy goes after he's fired. it's unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the mayberry-like soundstage artificiality.even viewing this strictly as a children's movie, it's very disappointing. it's not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. the pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus? a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). movies, even kid's movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. disney's "the love bug," for instance, at least had some interesting race action.

after leaving tv's popular "the andy griffith show", don knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matinée-pleasing comedy vehicles. unfortunately, "the reluctant astronaut", filmed on the cheap (as were most of knotts' movies), is much worse than his others. don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to astronaut training camp...but not as a candidate for space travel--they want him as their new janitor! some may say the weak satire capitalizes on americans' then-fresh fever for the new age of technology, but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied. it gets off to a good start, with an ok set-up and nostalgic locations, but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic. * from ****

i love don knotts, let me just say that up-front! he is an enormous talent and the best at what he does, which is portray a nervous, lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority. he is fabulous in this role as roy fleming, the reluctant astronaut, but the film is pretty dull, really, even though as a kid my brother and i delighted in watching this and his other films. it's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children. i'd categorize it as 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.as with all of knotts' films, there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when knotts gives one of his shaky, open-mouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you are.from an adult perspective, one thing i think that is great about this film is how it captures nasa in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! and i was surprised at how suave and studly leslie neilsen was back then. only complaint about the story is roy's love interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who can't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if you're like me, you'll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end. beware -- you'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching, it's that catchy.

i guess i only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is "entrails of a virgin". you already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid-80's production from japan. now, there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in japan, but kazuo komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls. not even attempting to tell a story, "entrails of a virgin" simply presents a hodgepodge of un-arousing semi-pornographic sex and truly poor gore-effects that wouldn't even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80's horror. images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly under-aged girl. he dumps her not even a minute after climaxing (typical) and she begs him to stay, even if she has to share him with other women. i don't get it. is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy? because it's really clichéd and wrongful. anyways, back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models. surprised by upcoming fog on their way home, the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex-demon who kills them all. the acting performances are amateurish, the dialogs inane and primitive and komizu's direction is weak and uninspired. i can tolerate all that, including the woman-unfriendly portrayal of sex, but i came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably mean-spirited wrestling sequence. one of the males brutally hits, kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony. this sequence is, in my humble opinion, the absolute low-point of asian exploitation cinema. one to avoid and maybe even boycott.

entrails of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. if this was an intentional characteristic of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance-but of course it isn't. without getting too much into plot summary, let's take a quick walking tour of the events. at a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diaper p***ing. a vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress, but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster i like to call "the muddy ninja." this monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if you don't count oral sex) who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand. finally she has her guts pulled out, and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. got all that? if you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak japanese and don't have any subtitles. in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks, putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. it will certainly be something different.

less self-conscious and much less pretentious than guts of a beauty, this kazuo komizu gore flick is worth a look (at least once).sleazy snapshotters escort wanna-be actresses/models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them. unfortunately (for the horny boys), a long-schlonged demon, who lives in the woods, has already targeted the girls for fun.the thing even ends up having fun with the boys -- that's if you consider beheadings, dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs "fun".once again, it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film.just as komizu mangled living dead at tokyo bay with his ineptitude, he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty shots.don't buy the hype, though, or you'll be sorely disappointed.

ok the plot is, wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes, strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies (sometimes a combination of the two) then a demon comes around kills the men, rapes and kills the women, and waxes poetic about the meaning of life. moronic special effects, bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside, you get what you expect from a film with a title like this. i guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea, just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo 'gaira' komizu directed film.dvd extras: subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part 1 (part 2 is on the entrails of a beautiful woman dvd); and theatrical tailermy grade: f

maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the dvd, which is with the director as he keeps saying "hi, kids" into the camera like a buffoon), but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator. turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. there's a problem- and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! and with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. entrails of a virgin has neither. it's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.in this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by "a murderer" as he's credited. first off, the director kazuo 'gaira' komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. it looks like it's from another movie. then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. first the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. then the murderer, who like d'amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. this is like saying, however, that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. an eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name i can't remember. even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! on top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) you just want it to be done with, for the 'i hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.

given the title and outlandish box art, i was ready for just about anything. perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because i was left a little dry.a film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. where hasn't this set up been used before? the difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin i can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. the mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.4/10

ok, well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers, and let me say, it didn't help the film any.the film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. since i don't want to spoil (not that there was anything to spoil) i shall let your imagination figure out the "zany" (and i use that word lightly) antics that follow.i had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film, and i would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.then again i could be wrong...

plot: an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra-marital hijinks in a flashy car. they then become stuck (literally) in a compromising position, while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities.that's it. that's the entire movie. there may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless, but actually physically painful to watch. the fact that it starred two of the uks best up-and-coming actors (one of whom is now sadly deceased) only adds to the horror.ian charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar-winning 'chariots of fire'. let's remember him for that role, and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened.

cut to the chase, this is one of the five worst films that i've ever seen.not that they didn't try. there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there, a good cast, some good acting. i'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went horribly wrong.some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story, a lot of overacting by the lead (who probably is much better when restrained), some bad directing and editing. i had enough at about an hour, tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran. there was also an insincerity about it all, being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it. that was bolstered by the pretty 17 year-old girl who was in love with the 30 year-old junkie.and the frantic nature of the lead was a turn-off enough. there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was listless and unending (with uneven time lines). the characters were colorful but to no end, which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you've just not seen enough.skip it. i assumed that this was a first-time director who was enamored by his own turds, but he has done this before. i'm puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.

the fifth "black emanuelle" i've watched has, potentially, the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery/prostitution racket which takes her from san francisco to rome to macao and back to her own hometown, new york! the film is peopled with past veterans of the series which, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely ivan rassimov (appearing here as a head of a united nations committee for third world countries!), karin shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and don powell (as rassimov's chauffeur).unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite their being shown in the dead of night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in "stracultr) in which an asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here!! still, a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls (including, naturally, gemser and shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a new york bridge with a group of bums (this is the way he gets their votes, get it!) - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact.the most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from gemser's penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her excursion to india to interview a charlatan/guru (george eastman made up to look considerably christ-like!) who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely; of course, when emanuelle calls him up on it, he ends up having premature ejaculation...!!

worst bob hope comedy ever(and that includes some heavy competition). hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "steering his ship". somebody certainly steered this hope-hackery over the cliff, as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement. where's bing crosby when you really need him?

the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, is beyond me. this really must be one of the worst films, in addition to "haunted highway" i have ever seen. bad actors, and a really bad story. there's no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even though it's halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed, not to mention gutted, people with tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people i might add) and some person dressed up as satan dragging dead people out of his house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of satan and jesus' appearances on the same day, like this kid does. when i was 8, i sure had more brains than that. but, the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute satan look-alike as well, no questions asked. the question throughout the film is, is it really satan, or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it? well, he's got human hands, arms, built and whatever, so i guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well, otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it. then, with this person being human and all, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!!???) cops (all with guns and training i presume), and a few other people.....and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him, or what?the whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing i've seen, and i would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap.

satan's little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen. when i say better i mean the story. the film hatches a new plot, something that's not so cliché in the horror genre - something fresh. but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it. questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie.the film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv. i was tired of all the so called "terrifiying" hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. the cover art for satan's little helper immediately caught my attention. as you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! i knew it was a straight to dvd release - but i took a chance. i mean, i just seen "boogey man" the night before - so it couldn't get any worse! after i watched the movie, i was semi-satisfied. i loved the plot of the movie. it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill. in some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror. it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night. this way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid. they would simply think he was his guardian. but, this is also where the "plot holes" begin to surface.if your son came home with a "friend" he met trick or treating - that's fine. you wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him. if however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child. you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. you would ask why he is with your son. he doesn't know him. you would tell him to please leave. he isn't a family friend. he's a stranger. now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers. in this case, the mum is completely fine with it. huh? they never seem to think it's a tad odd that the "man" doesn't speak - at all. gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word.the film goes down hill from there. the thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was "do you want some cider?". i can't count how many times she says this in the movie. it's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! the movie started promising, and failed to deliver. it was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver. i guess you could call it a "dud","flop" etc..the best thing about the movie is the cover art. though, something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars!

with a title like this, you know not to expect a great horror movie. but this was really bad, even with low expectations. the plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the entire movie ! the actors are not that bad, but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid. no suspense, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically at that. it became so boring towards the end, that i actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. i couldn't care whatever happened. amanda plummer was great in pulp fiction, but come on.. that was 13 years ago, and she hasn't done anything decent after that. so no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap.. avoid or be warned..

i'm going to say first off that i have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought. i was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count. but that would be about it. let me explain. i paid literally £1 for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks, b-movies especially. but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons (which i'll touch on in a sec) then it failed magnificently. not only did it shoot for b and miss, it landed somewhere around f. this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts. i say above that it's likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror, which can either be very good or very bad. for example, later freddy films (dream warriors onwards) are all about freddy's style and nose-thumbing, which works out great! but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid. i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good. in fact, for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find. but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills. for instance, when 'satan' smashes the cat against the board and writes 'boo' with it's blood using its body as a brush. or when 'satan' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman. now i'm not usually too against senseless kills in films-hey, thats the point, right? but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film-plot especially. for me, the film went downwards from then on. one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it. the kid, dougie was just ridiculously annoying!!! i'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick! i mean, come on!!! i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid, like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help, but this kid took the biscuit! i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it! it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say 'duh!' one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall-because thats what watching this film felt like. why didn't i just turn the film off? mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film. but i was wrong in this case. the ending did not redeem this film, it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line. i get it already! the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else, be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume! i get it! this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid! and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film, watch out for the intestines. frankly, if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that, i'd be surprised he wasn't already dead, let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair.in fact, i'll even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer. purely because when his 'comedy routine' worked, it did work. all in all, the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down. why was the killer killing? i don't know. i can live without knowing who he actually was, thats fairly typical, but without some kind of motive - hell i don't know, i'd settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid! -it just seems more than senseless, just stupid. stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. in fact, i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with imdb just so i could comment on it. save your money, save your sanity. stay away from it!

oh man, i know what your thinking: "with a title like that, i can't go wrong!" uh yes you can. i too, loved the title, but man i hated the stupid kid that played "satan's little helper" i hated the mom too, and the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend - i hated all those people! man, it was agony watching this sometimes! the only reason this doesn't get 1/10 is becuz condsidering the low budget, they did ok. but oh man did i hate those actors, so stupid! i knew it was going to be bad, i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer, and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too. oh the agony, do not watch!

if you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy, then look no further.starting at about the halfway point, the beautiful and erotic arielle dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity. that is the only thing that made this movie worth watching.the story is both lame and preposterous, the humor is corny, and character development is basically non-existent.

another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko's marvellous 1950 thriller "where danger loves". this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum, faith domergue and claude rains. crisply photographed in black & white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow. "where danger lives" is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood's past - (see my full review).unfortunately, none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc, the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension! poorly written (allen rivkin) and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by richard baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife (a risible audrey totter) is totally implausible and unconvincing (how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess). then when she "unsurprisingly" ditches him for one of her playmates (lloyd gough) our timid pharmacist, instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune, plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out. the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan (another bland performance). so who did kill him? well, at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry. mr. berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening. so much for that! a most unfortunate effort! c'est la vie!best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling, an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes. hey! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes! huh?in its favour however, are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers, commentaries and featurettes for both films. but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic!

i will admit that i'm only a college student at this present time, an english major at that. at the time i saw this film i was a high school student--i want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like. i'm not a phd by any means.that said...this movie is simply terrible. it's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. my mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i'd seen with the films logic and science--and they are numerous--and she dismissed my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds." in this case, apparently so.leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film. leaving that behind, the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them.i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html

at first glance this documentary/fiction/cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking. of course, when something provokes thought, it can then be scrutinized. the reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions. the link that "what the bleep..." would have you see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. the transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area, washington d.c. in this case. in reality the hra (homicides, rapes, and assaults) crime rate was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992. there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. in fact, each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked.my conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. either way, i suggest that you do not waste your time.if you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts, you might consider mindwalk (1990).

i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. i found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). like others, i found this film to be an awful mix of "real" science and pseudoscientific, new age propaganda. as a psychologist, i was especially offended by candace pert's contributions. true, i was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the "consciousness" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ("consciousness") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. it is an old orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay "politics and the english language." to refer to "consciousness" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as "based in science" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave-states "democratic republics" and hitler when he called his party a "socialist workers" movement.i don't claim to really understand quantum physics. i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. ah, but we americans do love "instant enlightenment," and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. if it asked questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).by the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several "expert commentators" with the maharishi mahesh yogi (and tm), not to mention j.z. knight, who often speaks in her "ramtha" voice. (i'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. but then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10,000 years ago, i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? oh, i forgot, i'm the creator of "good" and "bad" advice, so it's all my fault, not ramtha's.)what a mess.

another cult strikes again. this isn't a spoiler, because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercial...ramtha's school of enlightenment.when any religion/philosophy needs to hide behind an oz-like screen of deceit, i walk away. thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend"...to have wasted precious resources on this new-age lobotomizer would have been tragic. i can only hope that they "truly believe they can walk on water" enough to take that guidance to it's "logical" conclusion...in other words; walk, drown...or shut up :-) as a movie...it deserves a strong "1" on it's entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographer's roommate...eeeeeek!). if you must see this film, borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it.

"what the bleep do we know!?" was one of the worst times i have spent at the movies. it was less of a movie and more of an after school special, but at the same time nothing special at all. the attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost anyone will tell you. marlee matlin in her underwear just shouldn't happen. i won't dwell on it. what i will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. this movie, while tedious, also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning. it was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative, become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shoeless piece of propaganda. interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence. however, the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds. it completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us, which seems to be more the case. or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us. in this way, the movie was inappropriately solipsistic. solipsism and interconnectivity just don't mix unless you're god almighty. if you are, you will be impressed (?!?) by all the neat things this movie will reveal that you can do. if not, you will be sorely disappointed, a moron, or perhaps both. also, the title is so ridiculous, i have trouble warning people not to see the movie because i feel retarded mentioning it by name. shame on everyone involved.

this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed. the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere. this is a drama, but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was. that's never a good sign. the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien's roommates/bandmates. they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously. the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd. the soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. unless you're one of those crazy, rabid dominic monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.

when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll, and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his "character" movies, but it was my ambition to own them, too. what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen-year-old i must have been. thankfully sense prevailed and live a little, love a little is the only elvis film i own.the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single. (his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years  his first uk no.1 in 25) even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren't exactly first rate. however, a little less conversation - rollnecks and 60s grooving aside - is a real standout. finding a lesser-known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions. it's nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated, but it's also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult. (and what chauvinistic lyrics, too. though what other elvis song contains the word "procrastinate"?)but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it. actually based on a novel (kiss my firm but pliant lips - what kind of lame novel would that be?) this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a "comedy" dog and a nympho. within 90 seconds of meeting him, michele carey asks "would you like to make love to me?" quite a fast mover by any standards i'm sure you'll agree.i do seem to recall that some of elvis's early movies - most notably jailhouse rock and king creole - weren't too bad, but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers. being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts, causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh, and models dress as pink mermaids. there's even a dream sequence for god's sake. maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn't conform to is in not having all that many songs. with just four to choose from, including the credits number, you're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks. some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes, but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain. of the remaining three tracks, then the edge of reality isn't actually that bad, though elvis's dance to it must surely have been called "the bear trap".in one sense, for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content. sadly, however, with talking dogs, middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you'll ever see, elvis's dignity is obliterated by this movie.

a half-hearted attempt to bring elvis presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-playboy magazine subplot, presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clichés. a woman picks e.p. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life--and he doesn't seem to care! dick sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but don porter and rudy vallee (!) try hard as elvis' two bosses (he's moonlighting, you see). some of the songs are quite good, especially "almost in love", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated elvis sex-comedy--look elsewhere. when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together, there's actually a wooden board in between them! get real. ** from ****

if i write a review about a movie, maybe it will stick with me... but generally i expect that i will have forgotten i've seen this one a mere two weeks from now. so why bother? because again i find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. i didn't expect i'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on.it wasn't great, but at least it was not unbearable... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe. it was just sweet fluff... and if you can't take it, stay in the locker room boys. i agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic, and won't be a total bore to an adult.it offers a few good chuckles here and there, but nary a side splitter. sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining, but at least it doesn't suck (as so many have said it does). maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides? i have a tendency to grade on the bell curve, so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book. giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing. giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. i cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff (or that i am even bothering to write about it). am i missing something? anyway, it should be noted that emma roberts performs her role as clairedycat quite convincingly. ariell kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due. you might also recognize bruce spence playing leonard, though his role is ancillary.surely you can miss this one if you are an adult. but, if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her... and be prepared not to hate it (you might even enjoy it).

i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. this movie has the worst acting since killjoy.here is a brief outline of the plot: the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach, drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach "hunk" who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life. somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. uh oh! here comes the competition! the stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. we soon find out jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in australia, which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, i think i'm gonna cry). a huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yup, you guessed it, a mermaid! this is where the "story" really takes off. basically, they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the "hunk".this is a preteen flick with acting so bad, it makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of oscar-worthy performances. this movie has all the clichés possible... the best friends, the "hunk" who everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man... you name it, it's in there. i took one for a lot of people by watching this. consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you. please, don't see this movie. don't make it so i suffered in vain.

you like beautiful girls? yeah me too. what is there bad to say about beautiful girls/women? nothing imo, so why would i give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it got the "talents" of chiaki kuriyama and aya ueto? if i really wanted to watch beautiful people, i'd watch mtv or something that's why. this is a movie, a so called action movie nevertheless. so by definition it does not even really need a plot right? i'm not agreeing 100%, but let's say yes to that. so what does it need? 20 minutes footage from part 1 (i might be exaggerating a little bit, but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)?! that would be "no". but then again you never know, the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so hey let's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice? just to be sure they won't forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course!!!! so forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about the "acting" (and no, i don't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting!) ... what does that leave? yes the action scenes. the action scenes are not bad and that's the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! i was giving this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... you have better things to do/watch, believe me ...

there's no denying the first azumi film was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young, attractive actors and certainly wasn't lacking in the budget department. yet it more than entertained for what it was, and i can't deny i enjoyed it immensely."azumi 2" lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful. the first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb ryuhei kitamura at the helm. with him, he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics, but the originals style, beauty and most importantly, its heart. while the first had a simple "hitlist" plot, this one has a corkscrew mess of a story, with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated. gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters; azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest. characterisation is non existent; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies, i'll be shocked. the same applies to the villains here. the final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension. the fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness. the villains themselves try far too hard to be campy, and even if they were all combined, they don't come within a country mile of the pete burnsian antics of jo odagiri in the original.####major spoiler at end of paragraph!##### aya ueto tries her best it has to be said, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. azumi is now a fully fledged assassin, meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of man with no name style mysteriousness, ueto's model looks become even more inappropriate. i know this is supposed to be the point, but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around. the less said about chiaki "remember me from kill bill" kuriyama's performance the better; it suffices to say her "turn" from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm.overall, this was just a colossal disappointment. any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film. a lazy, unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess.

the movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (i'm sorry i'm biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1. i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. i amazed myself being able to sit through it. lets talk about the plus points of the movie. the girl. ueto aya is cute. thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. the fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. now lets talk about the minus points. firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back. it seems more like a drama way of shooting. typical japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. i do not mind unrealistic movies. but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of shinobi, though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. moreover, to portray "i-don't-know" what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... too many of these spoils the show. it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. it degrades the show greatly. thirdly, isn't azumi supposed to be an assassin. she seems more like an one-man-army to me, just that she is a female. i don't think you see assassins charging into army camps. the only time i felt she acted "assassin-liked" was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1. lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.

i loved the first "azumi" movie. i've seen ms. ueto in a variety of her tv appearances and i've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. i have to say that this movie was much weaker than i'd expected.given the movie's cast and set up in "azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in parts, and sprinkled with very poor, unconvincing, and wooden acting.when they bothered to reference the first movie, they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak. in "azumi", the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. in "azumi 2" she seems somehow diminished and less-impressive.that's not to say it was a total loss. there were a few decent fight scenes and some over-the-top characters. unfortunately, the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that shusuke kaneko and yoshiaki kawajiri are not ryuhei kitamura and isao kiriyama. the latter two truly captured the "manga" feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite "got it."

i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly. so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2, but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. the pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise (if that is possible!). i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment. there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. the fight with the spider guy (straight out of an episode of monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam!! azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but aya still does an okay job. she looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? i don't think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.

the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi's fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.that's as poetical as i'll get when talking about azumi 2: death or love, because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. but i won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. by the way, chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.this brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'death' side of the epic. in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. to no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. in azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, i won't lie and i'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film, but i'll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. for what it's worth, azumi 2: death or love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.

i am so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny... and i thought "mulan" was unbelievable! however low my expectations of disney have become, i never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off. there is no respect here for any true chinese culture, just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts.i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl... but, fortunately, most normal teenage girls--particularly asian teenage girls--are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. and from a cultural stand point, it's almost impossible. yes, there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion, but they're pretty rare. and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars. another stereotype, maybe, but a fairly true one. because that's how chinese parents work. that's how chinese values work. if they wanted to go for authenticity, they would've made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family.this just adds to my frustration with american movies. asian culture isn't about meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. we don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time, and we don't all know some form of martial arts. we're a people, and i'd appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature.

wendy wu: homecoming warrior has a very good, strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie. i am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much. i thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem entertaining to younger children. the matrix moves ruined the action, you know that it was absolutely fake. then there was the yen lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win. it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. so wendy learns a lesson...blah, blah, blah. i'm ready for the next dcom.

wow. this was probably the worst dcom ever. i watched the first half hour and i laughed. brenda song plays wendy, the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen. she is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts. shin teaches her the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world.this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible.brenda song is a comedic actress and i can't see her playing a serious role. it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin. shin couldn't act at all, and everything was totally unbelievable.i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing i came up with was the power rangers. this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger-esquire that it was just corny and stupid. the characters weren't likable and i just couldn't stand to watch it. disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel, along with other movies like jumping ship, color of friendship, go figure, read it and weep, & stuck in the suburbs.if you like action-adventure and corny jokes, you'll like this movie.

i'm here again in your local shopping mall (of course, 'cause that's where the high school kids hang out!!!!!) to demonstrate how awful "bendy poo: prom courier" really is!!!!! to prove how bad this joke of a dcom this is......we're going to take these four sumo wrestlers, and stuff them into this photo booth. how...cozy!!!!! hai! huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! uh!!!!! how awful is it????? it's so bad, disney channel flushes away its money, yet again, with those exciting yet determining 10-second promos, keeping the viewers wondering, "when is this going to be on?????" and then, suddenly, when it does come on, for one, this not only got a higher tv rating than usual, but this was only seen once!!!!! oh, no!!!!! one time everyone!!!!! plus, this movie is about high school and stuff, and believe me, i will not go any further with what else is in there.....say ch...smile!!!!! (snap!) avoid this one at all costs. 0/10

worst dcom i have seen. ever. well, maybe not as bad as smart house. this was just bad. the acting and story was fine, but the effects sucked!they were so fake! the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen. that was probably the only scene in which i was excited.overall, i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly. i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.4/10

there isn't more i can say that saying this film was awful. the whole chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell. but telling the audience that every chinese knows chinese history without even studying it just laughable. that is like saying every american knows american history without studying or every filipino, etc, etc. it just isn't believable.the story is flat out hideous. it talked about shin being from a monastery in china - later identifying it from bejing. however, the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on mongolia. i know the current chinese regime wants to claim areas like mongolia for its own, granted. but its a distinct nation and it even labels "mongolia" on the map. did disney studios fail 5th grade geography? the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him. her training is just cheesy as well. and, lets cut to the chase: everything about this film is bad. its bad enough to laugh at and cry over. the taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.the evil eyes thing was cheesy. however, the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it. they should have left the evil eyes ending in it. but instead somehow evil is defeated. yey! overall,not worth the time of the dog in the film. brenda song should get on with another studio. "f"

there are several things wrong with this movie- brenda song's character being one of them. i do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- i honestly don't. i believe she is given poor lines. she is just supposed to be, "that vain, rich girl", and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in, it can't even get a dry laugh from me here.either way, i really should have known what to expect when i sat down to watch this film.the movie was not that terrible...initially. wendy's reaction to shen was completely natural. i mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight "the great evil" and save the world? which brings me to another point. i know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in chinese culture. it seems like all of the "warriors" in wendy's family line were women. correct me if i'm wrong, but i doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that. sure, maybe they could've worked it in somehow, but they offered no explanation whatsoever. by doing so, they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by hollywood and the media.nevermind that, however- let us continue.wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on. yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming- i mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? the problem is, when "the evil" starts to manifest himself, wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be. she is extremely careless- even for someone like her. she continues not to care about her training. i will use this conversation as an example, shen: "if you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone." wendy: "whoa, talk about pressure. well...let's talk about something else." yes, let's wendy. let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training. of course shen lets her, but his character has an excuse. better that he cooperate with her, than that he not, and she not train at all, and get them both killed.oh, speaking of which. shen also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (i am assuming that part).this makes wendy's actions more unforgivable.as the script-writer would have it, wendy's homecoming and this "great battle" are on exactly the same day. do you know what wendy does? do you even have to guess? yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, (who shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she "felt weird fighting an old man") inform her that shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.we initially see some half-decent fighting, that is actually entertaining. until finally, the great evil comes out of wendy's rival-for-homecoming's body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.don't ask.anyway, wendy gets all "panicky." then shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.wendy catches shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.she screams title of said article out.now...it was bad enough that wendy became powerful far, far too fast. no, i will not let it be excused because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power within" her.since when, though, did she learn healing? no, worst...since when could she resurrect people? so shen is raised from the dead. then, wendy and he fight the guy.he loses way to easily. the worst part, is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. then the monks commend wendy on her sacrifice.two things, #1: don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more "finesse" to it? #2: what sacrifice? the fact that she didn't go to homecoming? because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleed. i mean, come on now, this movie was tv pg, i wanted to see somebody get hurt.ah-hem...moving on.i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one, based on my comments. part of critique, you must know, though, is breaking a thing down. you don't necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's there, you bring attention to it. this movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.so, i suppose it was all right. not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching it.

i thought this movie was terrible. i'm chinese, so i thought everything was totally wrong. many of the facts were incorrect. the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded shihuangdi. i also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. many of the actors and actresses were not very great. some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. i think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get. disney has really got to get more information about chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. mulan was quite accurate. watch this movie if you want to waste some time.

i thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. the elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. i'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:first, when shen told wendy that he would help her study the history of china, i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show wendy actually studying chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it. the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the autumn festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. they could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the moon lady. the myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the divine archer, hou yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the hou yi shot the eight out of nine suns). because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, chang-o stole it. after stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. she then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, i, most of the time, heard about this version). i thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally chinese oriented.the last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the terra-cotta warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese. the terra-cotta warrors serves as a connection of china's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. it would be understandable if wendy, considering she is chinese-american and doesn't have full chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.the whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and shen want to do is fight... i mean, it's rated tvpg due to violence, which goes against the confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.all in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, i would give it credit (2 stars) for removing one stereotype of asians and asian-americans of being smart and quiet.

this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous. if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which i might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to. the casting in this movie wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all. on a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4. brenda song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. when she made some of her "fighting" poses, i started laughing out loud. i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, i think that was incredibly stupid, and how wendy's (brenda song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to. so to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under.

i'd give it a 2/10.i was really, really disappointed.the storyline was poorly developed, for instance, the incidents were too short and brief, hence the moral was not clearly brought out. i thought brenda song did a fine job, but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role. i could see the need to put in western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts, where chinese elements were needed too! the villain for example. his physical appearance resembled a robot, instead of something out of the chinese culture. the final and the worst flaw, were the incorrect, and distorted facts placed in the show.others may point out that this is a 'kid's show' and hence, there is no need for the such high standards. however, there are other disney shows, such as mu lan, which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.in conclusion, i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned. a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on.

first of all when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu, i was definitely excited. brenda song, one of the hottest girls on disney channel, would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that... until i saw the movie. the action was poorly constructed, the movie couldn't have realated to anyone, the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked... along with the plot. if you really think about it's a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen, the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil. the idea just wasn't all that original, the movie is waste of time.

this reworking of anthony shaffer's classic play did not last long in cinemas. having recently suffered through it on cable, i still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. director kenneth branagh, writer harold pinter, and star/producer jude law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original.michael caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film. he now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead, played in that version by laurence olivier. (both were nominated for best actor oscars, but lost to marlon brando in the godfather.) looking puffy and washed-out, caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as batman's butler. he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter. what's next -- alfie ii, or son of the man who would be king? but then, no one benefits from this inane adaptation by pinter, who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of shaffer's witty character interplay. branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a second-rate nightclub. neither the shadows nor the tight, overacted close-ups can help law overcome his dull screen persona. the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller, almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.fans of the original stage production (with anthony quayle and keith baxter) and the olivier/caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream. the late mr shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as hitchcock's frenzy and several agatha christie adaptations, must be turning in his grave, wishing he could plan a real murder or two!

harold pinter rewrites anthony schaeffer's classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways. the original film starred laurence olivier and michael caine. caine has the olivier role in this version and he's paired with jude law. here the film is directed by kenneth branaugh.the acting is spectacular. both caine and law are gangbusters in their respective roles. i really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities. it's wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the script's direction goes haywire.harold pinter's dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and i understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play (which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like).the problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful. michale caine walks law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason. conversations happen repeatedly in different locations. i know pinter has done that in his plays, but in this case it becomes tedious. why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that law is sleeping with caine's wife? it would be okay if at some point law said enough we've done this, but he doesn't he acts as if each time is the first time. the script also doesn't move caine through his manipulation of law all that well. to begin with he's blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us.(never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered) in the original we never suspected what was up. here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why law's milo doesn't see he's being set up. there are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much.thinking about the film in retrospect i think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps. the opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between caine and law. missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller. instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesn't let them be real.despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work

i saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand. the plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing. the movie didn't have the "battle of wits" feel to me. the actors just spewed out mouthful's of nonsense, at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on. the plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end (i'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach), even the ending was predictable. and you could tell the detective was jude law in a costume, everything from the fake accent, terrible dental work, costume shop facial hair, everything pointed to it being a disguise. the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life. this movie had the feel of a puppet show with jude law and michael caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show, really boooring in my opinion.

if you're after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi, you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you've found you're movie.this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep. (type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs. fiction articles.) from a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit.i wonder how the director/co-writer agnès merlet defended her film at the time? perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim, which would've been unfortunate, because lets face it, she was.

dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result. violent sexy milligan at his most home made. little better than a home movie (as much of milligans films are) this is a trip into depravity 1960's style. notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint.(though decidedly r rated). the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production.(no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke). its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around.

sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail ("casino royale", "our man flint" are worse than almost any james bond movie). after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for some peace and quiet. (*1/2)

this was an incredibly stupid movie. it was possibly the worst movie i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. i cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6.............

imagine you're a high-school boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend. how bad would a movie have to be, in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended? this movie is that bad. really. movies often become so bad that they're good; this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness. it is painfully bad. horribly, terribly, crime-against-humanity bad.

this is a really dumb movie. it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't.some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween. they come to earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. these aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. other than the aliens, the acting is terrible. the writing is obviously meant for children, because every character is written like a kid.this is a dumb movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe.my rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. pg for mild language.

i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a double-shot, automatic crossbow with sights on it. not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights, but beowulf beat grendel in hand-to-hand combat. the terrible, wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all sci-fi original movies didn't help either. having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my bile rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead, that's really about all i have to say. but, you might as well just realize that it's a made-for-tv movie and skip it right there.a travesty.

i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny. i saw it again last week, and you can guess the result. some funny parts in it, very few and too long. the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me.if you want a total b-movie this is a good pick, but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size

the original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and near perfect. lv2 must be a candidate for "worst first sequel to a really good film". in lv2 everyone keeps shouting, when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny. lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1, except of course that a parody should be inventive. if you loved lv1 just don't see this film, just see lv1 again!!

in 1993, "the visitors" was an enormous hit in france. so, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. indeed, it's supposed to tell a sole story. jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course. the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard... instead of this, the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. as a consequence, the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed, sometimes a bit of a mess.but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying. then, why did jean-marie poiré the film-maker engage muriel robin in the female main role? he made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful. the other actors aren't better: marie-anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau, unbearable. of course, the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. certain sequences and dialogs are affected. it also appears hollow because poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie. thus, a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.a labored and disappointing follow-up. anyway, what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?

everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie! my grandma could have done better than that! but that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark!) if the first episode of les visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one. the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it. clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, robin is trying to act like lemercier (because she's replacing her) but that's grotesque'. lemercier is lemercier, robin is robin! even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act. i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role (lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played lemercier playing her role'! as for the story, it's just too much! of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode. the gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. no, really, there's no more than 3 funny parts in this. the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects. so you have only 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment'! 2/10

this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. the actress replacing jean reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. no script since it was apparently written and added to daily. no attention to camera or shots in mind. poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101. how this pile got through no one can tell. it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. this movie has one good part ...its end! this film is my #1 worst film of all time, finally "howard the duck" is no longer the goose.

the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. in fact i am sure i will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, i will at least give it a go.firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. in fact the film might as well have been called 'toothbrush' or 'wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. at least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. i'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here.a more suitable title would have been, 'horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes.' yes that fits better.the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling, and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character....abysmal.the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off. bonus.otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one. no vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever, ever, ever watch this one again.no word of a lie, this film could put you off motion pictures for life.

the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. it's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.very little happens in this film. and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. but the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. it's a travesty. unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. the story in general is, to say the least, uneven. the women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious.the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.a few people have said that this movie is a giallo. i cannot agree less with this opinion. anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. it's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. but it's not very erotic either.i can't recommend this to anyone.

la sanguisuga conduce la danza, or the bloodsucker leads the dance as i believe is it's common english title, is set on 'ireland' in '1902' where the mysterious count richard marnack (giacomo rossi-stuart) invites soon-to-be out of work theatre actress evelyn (patrizia webley as patrizia de rossi) & three more of her fellow soon-to-be out of work actress friends cora (krista nell), penny (lidia olizzi) & rosalind (marzia damon as caterina chiani) to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast. at first evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand samuel (leo valeriano) goes along as well. once there count marnack tells his guests that his father & grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife & there's a feeling of unease when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current count's wife who ran away not too long ago... along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off...this italian production was written & directed by alfredo rizzo & is total, complete & utter crap from start to finish. first things first lets start the criticism with the title the bloodsucker leads the dance, lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there aren't any vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever, no-one 'leads' anything at anytime & there most certainly isn't any dance or dancing so don't expect any of these things. what you should expect though is a tedious, dull, boring pointless little 'giallo' that takes over an hour before anyone is killed & any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape, the first hour of la sanguisuga conduce la danza is as plot less & uninteresting as anything out there. the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft-core porn film you've ever seen, then cut most of the soft-core porn out & that just leaves bad actors, bad dubbing, bad dialogue, a tiny bit of soft-core sex & lesbianism & absolutely nothing else. yep, it really is that bad. the mystery elements are crap, people do illogical things for no apparent reason & the overly complicated 'twist' ending is as bad as the rest of it, the sixth sense (1999) this ain't!director rozzi does an ok job & la sanguisga conduce la danza actually has a nice look & feel to it despite it's obvious low budget, i mean there are scenes where he shows a 'storm' raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black & white! so the film jumps from bright colour to black & white whenever it cuts to the storm & back to colour again! there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid & her friend discuss her breasts & she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments, this scene is so funny & just so unnatural that it's priceless & easily the films best moment even if a bad 70's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue! there is minimal nudity & the sex/lesbian scenes are very tame. forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a decapitated head.technically the films pretty good, the period setting & production design are actually quite impressive although it's not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough. the film has a nice sense of colour & the cinematography is fine. the film is dubbed so it's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible & the dialogue is even worse than usual.la sanguisuga conduce la danza is a terrible film, it makes no sense, it has virtually no story for over an hour, it has possibly the most misleading title ever & is really dull & boring with a confused stupid 'twist' ending. as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't waste your time, as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid. trivia note: the notorious (& banned in the uk) nazi exploitation/horror film horrifying experiments of the s.s last days (1977) aka ss hell camp & the beast in heat was directed by luigi batzella & he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la sanguisuga conduce la danza.

this movie is not only a very bad movie, with awful actors --or presumed actors--, a bored direction and a story unattractive, it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent "giallio" "torso", directed by sergio martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world. in "la sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. naturally, the scene in rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino's film. to put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo's movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. i think that such things are an offense to spectator.

after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles, redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance. i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie.the story is simple. a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation. after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one. who is the killer? who knows? there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday.the pace is excruciating. the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either.give this one a miss.

a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot (if anything, the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot!), this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo (with a strong dose of erotica) only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout  actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful! here, we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a count  since he had become enamored of the leading lady, a dead-ringer for his missing spouse)! the characters are pretty much stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing hero (played by giacomo rossi-stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, sluttish companion (recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot!), a meek but devoted stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who, for once, gets in on the action, if you know what i mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star femi benussi though, for what it is worth, this is really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. while the film is not by any means unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, snail's pace, shoddy production (with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not help matters. besides, marcello giombini's score, though pleasant in itself, comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said, the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one (considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here).

wow-this one sucks. i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible. a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. a bunch of nothing happens for a long time. some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-the end.the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few brief nudie shots. and believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. in fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. as everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no bloodsucking, nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. it may as well have been called 'the goat-raper leads the circle-jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely...) so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious.  i can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10 

(aka: the bloodsucker leads the dance)lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in. the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me.gothic lesbians get invited to a count's island castle for the weekend. one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.it's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit. go figure...(sic)dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity. directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo, this is one snoozer.pretty boring 2 out of 10

in contrast to my fellow reviewers, i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see.yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping.something must be lost in the translation of the word "bloodsucker" from the italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so tacked it onto the film anyway.this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film!now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - italian softporn from the mid 1970s.i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli (credited most often as "krista nell").the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s.i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned.i think krista nell played "cora" but underneath that massive hair style, costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure.there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out.maybe something is lost in the dubbing process.what were the positive points?well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there.the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island.it purports to be set in "ireland" (north or the republic?)in 1902, so everyone sports period piece costumes.some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!anyway an enjoyable romp.i rated it 4/10.

early film directed by d.w. griffith; it features a gloriously happy king (arthur v. johnson) and his queen (marion leonard) - but, wait! when the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the palace's minstrel (henry b. walthall). when the king discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe-type revenge. it's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). the sets make "the sealed room" look very staged. the performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. *** the sealed room (9/2/09) d.w. griffith ~ arthur v. johnson, henry b. walthall, marion leonard

terminus paradis was exceptional, but "niki ardelean" comes too late. we already have enough of this and we want something new.big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time, not behind. why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country?we are just born not reincarnated, and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times. most people dont remember or dont want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit. this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi! maybe younger directors should make the move.

yes, he is! ...no, not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies. pintilie is the naked "emperor" - so to speak...it's big time for someone to state the truth. this impostor is a voyeur, a brat locked in an old man's body. his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever. it is 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies. and if he does this in front of the audience, he might eve get a hard-on! did you know that, on the set of "niki ardelean", he used to embarrass poor coca bloss, by telling her: "oh, coca, how i wanna f*** you!"? she is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction! and, as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences, so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all?

this guy has no idea of cinema. okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. this all is very good, but look carefully: he does not know his job! the scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. he has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language. how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art? why don't they let him succumb in piece?

it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the "garcea" series or the "vacanta mare" child-plays... the difference is that mugur mihäescu, doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as "art". pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie ("duminicä la ora sase") followed by another one, nice enough ("reconstituirea"), tries to declare his film-lenghts "art works" - but, unfortunately, he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression. as such, "niki ardelean" offers again a sample of "how not" - this being about its only merit.

this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany.i find "the wooden horse" disappointingly boring. the subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but "the wooden horse" is told in a very plain way. it's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. the latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! i am disappointed by "the wooden horse", it wasted the potential to be a great film.

whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration. if in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afro-americans in georgia, such as shown in this film, obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there. it is rather hypocritical, to say the least, if everyone adores halle berry, whoopie goldberg, beyoncé, noemi campbell, denzel washington, will smith, et. al., whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides.white grandmother suddenly gets black grand-daughter thrust upon her, only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater. the story is sweet, not lacking tragic overtones, and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films, though the final scene has you guessing............ will he? won't he.......?gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering, and louis gossett is a good match for her; the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the show.a `nice' way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much, though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it.

my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos (battle for space) shown on russia's first channel on april 10-13, 2006. bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it's the case. the number of factual errors is such that it's impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). even the u.s. half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. the audience is not told of any v-2/a-4 launches from the u.s. three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number 'ue' onboard. apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon, etc. in the russian half, each and every person is ludicrous. korolev is scared of nkvd, glushko is saboteur and traitor, mishin is alcoholic etc. men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. uniform and decorations are awful. gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (i think this was added specially for russian version).

shocking!in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive. he was sincere, unpretentious and kindly, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person. in this movie i saw a clown! the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry. they made a cartoon! the real gagarin was someone else! don't believe in this movie!i saw this movie after the movies like "taming of fire" and "apollo 13" and after reading books "rockets and people" by chertok and "korolev: myths and facts" by golovanov. i was shocked by tiresome scenario, poor acting and producing, and a lots of inexactitudes of "space race".the movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in russia historical facts. a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated. some facts and details were perverted. for example, in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine, but in special prison design bureau. korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners. but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 (because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform). imho, the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies.

i've just visited russian forum of our tv-channel that had showed this film. well... 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed. we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film. but authors had in mind something else... :( we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here. we are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand. so i'd like to ask authors: where is our lunohod? and where, the hell our mir station? ah? i'm quite sure, that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrong's "walk on moon". and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes - i really have no time and enough space here! se our constructive critics in russian forum on www.1tv.ru

this movie sucked. the acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. examples:the heroine's negative comments about the hero. the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. no explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. it was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)

i sat through this movie this evening, forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two leads, gérard philippe and michèle morgan, were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in "something different," which this certainly was. they both gave fine performances, but of distasteful characters.indeed, the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is, of course, the major exception). what michèle morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained.this is supposedly based on a work by jean-paul sartre. all i could think was that, if sartre's work is anything like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus' masterful novel the plague, which dealt with a plague in north africa.a well-acted but uninteresting movie.

kurt russell (as steven post) works as a mail-boy for struggling tv station ubc (that's united broadcasting corporation); he is going nowhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like "abraham lincoln's doctor's dog" to studio executives - because lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. programming director joe flynn (as francis x. wilbanks) wisely rejects mr. russell's proposals, but has no idea how to pick a hit tv show. his secretary heather north (as jennifer scott), who does double duty as russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who bugs the heck out of russell when he wants to watch tv. turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily pick the hits. russell discovers the chimp's talent, and uses him to advance his own career. understandably, things gets hairy for russell and the cast!raffles the chimp (handled by frank lamping) performs well; raffles does look bored and/or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimp is supposed to look interested; these could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. a mild satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit tv shows! and, it's a monkey who gets a beer during the commercials (drinking in a disney film)! a look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun tv actors to recognize and try to place. you could make a drinking game, in honor of raffles' beer-guzzling, by guessing actors, and where you've seen them before. here's a start - hey, isn't that "dr. bellows" from "i dream of jeannie"? down the hatch! **** the barefoot executive (1971) robert butler ~ kurt russell, joe flynn, john ritter

i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad. until this. this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time. i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is. robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this 'classic'.

sometimes, making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to everyone's advantage. while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting, the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn't work. this film was so hideously slow and pointless, not even robin williams could save this garbage. it's obvious barry levinson's dream fell flat on its face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.

watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction--none.the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. so, how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! it's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career. the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school.the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. i really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment.

you get a gift. it is exquisitely wrapped. the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. it is a sight to behold.then you cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open up the box, and find...nothing. that's toys. you either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.the film isn't without its point and purpose: war is a not a good thing. well, isn't that original! the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. it's like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying "just kidding."but even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. but the images are cold and emotionally sterile. like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. the film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. robin williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his ad-lib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. for this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an oz far removed from kansas. every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.it is said that this was director barry levinson's pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. like most pet projects that finally get made (radioland murders, radio flyer & battlefield: earth being great examples) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage. he had already perfected it to death.many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy, mechanical, wind-up monstrosities. so is the film itself.

my life is about saving animals. i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life. i can't even kill a spider, i put it outdoors. the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies, with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. the ending - the foster parents adopt sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty. why would anyone want their child to see this film?

this film reminded me so much of "a history of violence" which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence. dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble. don't these men have a job? anyway, dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap. funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it.sam peckinpah who made the "wild bunch" which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared. but it was done with style, and you believed it. straw dogs is not believable. first of all the location is wrong and does not work. why place it in england? i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930's or something. second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife.sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one.

ridiculous fluff, that compounds its error by trying to have meaning. joan, this time as a congresswoman, agatha reed, chairwoman of a committee dedicated to "investigating the high cost of food." says congresswoman reed, "the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year, see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant." she's all business, but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college, where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night (the parallel to joan's real life is unmistakable here, as it is in all joan movies). the degree causes much consternation on campus ("that would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education!")  but joan is unaware of this as she arrives. the college president, jim merrill, played by robert young, at his handsomest, happens to be joan's former teacher  and lover. it was with *him* that she spent the night out, all those years ago, but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married. naturally, this high-profile event will be covered by *life* magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be? yet another of joan's old lovers  this one, she hung out with in china "during the war", and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame. eve arden, playing joan's assistant, "woodie," is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job, if you didn't like her so much. but you not only like eve in this, as in all her roles, you adore her. she is so droll and no-nonsense, you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys. when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater, eve tells her it "looks fierce." but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings, she, joan, sees youth  herself at 18 "eager, expectant  a little frightened, asking 'what is life? what am i?'" but, of course, if we actually go into depth about joan at 18, the truth may be a little different. for me, this is the major problem in watching any joan movie. you can call her characters whatever you want to, but it's always all joan, all the time. so, since what we're always seeing is joan being herself, it's easy to dispense with character's names. it's just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue, like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18, joan had already been around the block several times. many men would have described her as eager, and as far as being expectant, she had already had several abortions at this point. but that's a personal problem, and i digress, but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as "and then joan does" this or that, or "we see joan as..." when we are not literally watching a home movie.there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks. it fails. what also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness. in the story, joan has written a book about free speech and made a film (no, not the one about the plumber), and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical, dr. pitt, who is about to be fired for his views, which are shockingly similar to joan's. this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one, to be sure, but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion.

rks films always have been commercial films which suited the 90's, from ghayal, daminihis last few films khakee were watchable family was crapthis film is a decent film but could be betterthe problem lies in there is lot of old fashioned clichés thrown in and many scenes come out too filmy and lengthyajay devgan's character is shown very well but his character gets heroic which could be subtlethe lengthy flashback could be avoided as thigns are simply long drawneven the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought outdirection by rks is decent, though it could be better music is okayajay devgan looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes he excels in dramatics vidya excels in the scene front of media pankaj has a not proper defined role and too filmy yet he excels in his part darshan jariwala hams as the old age villain the rest are okay

i'm not going to approach and critique the theories of raw. i mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made, and not a site debating philosophy.having said that, this video really blows. it's one talking-head shot of raw after another. some of it is archival video, so you can see how he has aged over the years, and that's pretty cool. but, otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous.it's a strange comparison, but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle *funny lady* (another really bad movie). after a while, i was so od'd on barbra, i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in: you know, a "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something else..." moment. but it was all about barbra. well this video is raw's *funny lady*. so, if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he prattles on with his theories, assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight, then be my guest. for me, i couldn't take it after 20 minutes.

tv pilots, don't you love them? quinn martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other tv detective movies, but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of mst where it belongs. roy thinnes is diamond head who takes orders from aunt mary to find super spy lovejoy, i mean tree. zulu and tso-tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does. there's more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970's)and the show itself is so anti-climatic. why did it not go to series? you figure it out, it's quite blatant. again it's fun for mst, but not a lot else!!

one of the many vigilante epics that flooded the market by the mid-80s. the routine plot has echoes of "the magnificent seven" (believe it or not), the action scenes are lamely handled and the special effects are non-existent. you could do worse....but the film is still just a waste of time. (*1/2)

becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls! miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene. once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen. if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid, i want someone to clue me in. absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms. i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd.the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention. i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent, however i was disappointed on both counts. god bless becky harris!

pretty awful but watchable and entertaining. it's the same old story (if you've lived through the 80s). vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the states. a-team meets death wish, my favorite!time goes on, the soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble. no, wait -- in fact, the friend is dead and it is his dad that's in trouble. our first hero, joey, is killed by an exceedingly horrifying (super pointy) meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father's small store from the local "protection" gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war. desperate for help, the father talks to sarge, the leader of joey's old unit from vietnam, when sarge shows up for the funeral.well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the old gang saddles up for the city. you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie.the one thing that drove me crazy is that sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning, and about how they're really good at what they do when they plan ahead. but joey wouldn't have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in vietnam in the first place if the unit hadn't been messing around! then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs, they do it again. for no reason at all, they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. phh!!!! i raise my hands in disgust. foolishness!there is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it's real. every single one of them. hmm....what are you going to do? keep watching, i guess. the movie isn't too horrible to watch, but it is a tease. there are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening. the most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie -- the explosives in vietnam, joey's death battle, and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside (poor teddy!).i guess my main beef with this movie is that i feel let down by it. even the confusing subplots with "mystery helpers" and their bizarrely cross-purpose motives wasn't enough to save it at the end. but someday maybe it'll all come right and they'll make a sequel. ha ha ha ha!!!

this is a strange sex comedy because there`s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex , most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes basic instinct look like an edition of teletubbies . i kid you not , the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you , especially if you`re watching with your grandparents .as for the rest of rita , sue and bob too there`s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the f word . this a rather bleak hyper-realist british film made at a time when channel 4 was the main investor in british movies which explains its made for television low budget feel

i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film's link with the eighties but i really wouldn't say it's an accurate depiction of most peoples' lives in that era - even on the poorest bradford estates. it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time. plenty of 'right-on' artistry for small, small audiences but enough well-connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights. ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you'll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in 'gregory's girl'. i would be tempted to call this a 'kitchen sink' drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry. however, as far as having a decent script is concerned, this film is indeed all washed up. for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading film-goers - i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it. steer clear my friends. it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates. it isn't..but it is grim. do the washing up instead.

my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world (or at least those who will read this) that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one. i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid. you could say i suffered watching it ... my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren't able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off. i do not recommend this to anyone. at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case. it is not a comedy, it is not drama, it is not action, it is not horror, it is just horrible!

one of, if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s. this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it.in turns gratuitous, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan, michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. it's no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. complete and utter rubbish on every level.

this movie tries to hard to be something that it's not....a good movie. it wants you to be fooled from begining to end,but fails.from when it starts to get interesting it falls apart and you're just hoping the ending gives you some clue of just what is going on but it didn't.

in the beginning and throughout the movie, it was great. it was suspenseful and thrilling. yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened. they mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow? it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore, was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be.

the progression of the plot is enough to "rope one in" and create curiosity about the outcome. however, ultimately, the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it. if the intention was to create a perpetual circle (occasionally done in the twilight zone), it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort.

the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense. what a waste of 2 perfectly good hours. if you can explain it to me...please do. i don't usually consider myself unable to "get" a movie, but this was a classic example for me, so either i'm slower than i think, or this was a really bad movie.

this movie was lame, lame, lame. what a build up! what a let down. all form, no substance. a terrible waste of talent and time. would not recommend it to my husband's dog, who will watch anything.

what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing. don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors, there is no ending. no explanation, no resolution, zip. this could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script.

a bickering, american family, vacationing in the west, discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence is stalking them. i generally love mystery-horror films like this. "cube", spielberg's "duel" and "the birds" are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more. apparently, "disappearance" writer/director walter klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film, and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer. i personally think he got about half way there, then the film just sunk.the actors are all kind of just "ho-hum". their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways. is anyone else absolutely sick of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds?!?!? at least give them some kind of justification for doing so!?!?!?as far as made-for-tv films go it's an above average fair for sure. director klenhard should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking. there's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see. i wonder if that was realno gore to speak of, and the 'creatures'or what ever the hell it is that's after these peopleare never shown, not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil indian spiritsoh, that really narrows it down for us!) or where the come from. there are lots of clichés here, too. why is it that towns-folk in these kinds of films are always really, really dumb? why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct? why? why? why? how 'bout a new scenario, folks! "disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways it's too familiar to us fans of direct-to-video horror fodder. hey, i've seen much worse films, and disappearance ain't bad, it's just too average.4/10.

this is waaaaay to much.. so frustrating to watch.. i was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some answers!!.. and what i've had in the end was nothing but a huuuge neon-sign question mark above my head!!!!! i haven't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time.. and what's bothering me is.. how come someone (an actor) read the script of such a bull!?#@ movie and say: ok, i'm in!!! let's film this! this is horrible!!! this movie suuuuuuuuuuuucks!!!!!! i just can't believe i've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this!!!

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** when i saw a preview for this movie i thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. but as most superstation original movies i was left disapointed. this gullible family ends up driving through this "deserted" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. their are more gaps than i can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what. it ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). the next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused.

if you like movies about creepy towns, hotels, houses, states (ala the eagles "hotel california"), etc. that possess the people that are "just passing through," read almost any stephen king novel instead. if you like the setting of "disappearance" start by reading king's "desperation" but also check out "the shining", "salem's lot" and "needful things."the crow motif, the desert, the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired. why didn't they just make the film from the "desperation" novel? maybe they approached king and he nixed? must be.susan dey and harry hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years, but they're still tv and direct-to-dvd caliber actors.

as a true elvis fan, this movie is a total embarrasment and the script is a disaster. the movie opens with the beautiful son "stay away" and the scenery of the grand canyon gives the viewer hope of something special. elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time, especially on the rest of the featured songs. i sat through this movie twice, just to make sure it is a piece of junk!!! 1 out of 10!!!

some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made. well, they are only partly right. for me, this is the worst movie ever made period! i have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry, this isn't even so bad, its good. there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis' other bad movies like clambake. this one is so rotten to sit through its painful. pure garbage. native americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here. actually, perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. grade: f

without question, the worst elvis film ever made. the movie portrays all indians as drunk, stupid, and lazy. watch elvis's skin change color throughout the film.

ok, the portrayal of the stereotyped 'indians' in this story is just plain wrong. i do agree that elvis looks rather good here, but yeah, his skin color does seem to change during the movie. i was thinking, ok,...he was never that tan in real life. it's some of the most obvious brown 'indian' makeup that i have ever seen. it's as bad as the 'indians' on 'f-troop' and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans!this movie is o.k., but typically lame story and mediocre songs, like in all of elvis' later films. he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible! i keep thinking 'thank god' that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. it is cool to see character actors joan blondell, katy jurado, l.q. jones, henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie, though.burgess meredith's 'indian' makeup is absolutely awful. it's the worst of the bunch for sure. what were the filmmakers thinking? was mr. meredith doing this one just for the money or what? i do love certain elvis movies, though. for example: 'love me tender', 'jailhouse rock', 'viva las vegas'. i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co-stars mary tyler moore and ed asner,'change of habit' in which elvis plays an inner-city doctor.oh well, at least elvis made a few good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.i'll always love elvis! thank you, thank you very much!

a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy. elvis presley plays an indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud). what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills, though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary isn't exactly pointed, but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest. as for elvis, he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point. this shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it, and though spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. *1/2 from ****

after a few lean years, 1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis: not only did he make that celebrated "comeback" tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  speedway and live a little, love a little. therefore, personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away, joe which, at best, emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering. sure, burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing  as, respectively, a dopey indian father to elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr. presley too - but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado (as meredith's mexican wife), the two jones  henry and l.q. - and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day! while there is a surprising (if not unwelcome given their usual blandness) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs! as can be expected, the typically 'western' arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy, snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point. on the other hand, the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here...

i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less.scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism. in their lab(a run down warehouse in l.a.), they create a t-rex. a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase.of course the t-rex(a rubber puppet)gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast. it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off.one cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city. she is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio. she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost.the t-rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are blazing gun battles and buildings(cardboard mock-ups)blowing up, but a single police car, or the army, nor anyone else ever shows up. such activity must be commonplace in los angeles.we can only hope that a sequel isn't planned.

you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason? well, out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t-rex. knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t-rex from jurassic park, i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie.i was not disappointed in the least.mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives, and of course, a big, poorly animated, sock-puppet t-rex. is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies? not to mention the rex's hungry is never satisfied...ever. how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat (really if you look down his mouth when he roars, it's solid...like a toy or something). now, i like watching incredibly bad b-movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. this one was hilarious. i'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you will laugh. do i blame the movie's budget...yes, but the acting didn't help either. ok, tony todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles...when you cry shouldn't "tears" come out? meh, i am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what i recommend: watch this movie, then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back. you will be writing mr. spielberg thank you letters the next day.

i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed.acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.plot - being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable. i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.special effects - rotflmao!!!!! they were short bus special directing - until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this.it is good to know that your friends/family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie

my first opinions on this movie were of course bad.i was expecting a horrible, crappy acting, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects movie.what i got was actually not that bad.the special effects were absolutely horrible, but i found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent.the acting wasn't that bad, and overall i had fun watching this movie.it's still a pretty bad film, but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be, and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me, even when it wasn't that good.overall, it's a film that should be avoided, but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be.

if you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of the eden formula. this wondrous film must have cost all of $50 to make. it features a wafer thin script, pathetically bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion, paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable (it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful). the actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter. the special effects are way beyond lousy. and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'tyranasaurus wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes.this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath. i loved every minute of it.

this review is mostly all spoilers. if you plan on enjoying this film, don't read this review. that's the problem with kids tv nowadays. it's all so patronizing and condescending. `wow, that was fun, wasn't it?' no it wasn't. and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well. and that is what 'flight of the reindeer' is all about. admittedly i haven't seen 'flight of the reindeer' in a few years so i might be hazy on some points, but i remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time. essentially, the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for christmas. now, the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal. i think it was bullfrogs. anyway, through this book, mr lecturer / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs. apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the north pole. now, if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window. flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon, but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept. but, mr lecturer isn't me, so i guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he's gone. of course, things go awry and before he knows it, a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he's stranded at the north pole. are you still following this? good. his family, of course, are devastated. i would be too, i mean, what a suck-tacular christmas. elsewhere, mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. rather than try to escape immediately, as i would have done, he greets everyone there with open arms. this hidden civilization of midget monsters, and he greets them with open arms. oooo-kayyyy. they feed him this story that they are the elves of santa claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist. and mr lecturer accepts all this. he even accepts that santa claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. there's just one problem - they don't want him to leave. the world can't know of their secret existence. after all, before they'd know it there'd be a mcdonalds and a starbucks on every street corner. still with me?now, mr nice guy's family find the book and assume he's gone to the north pole. boy, wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he'd just gone for a brisk walk? before the audience knows it, they're jetting off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. meanwhile, mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave. i can't remember exactly, but i do recall him holding santa claus to gunpoint. a fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via santa's sleigh. with santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes, mr whatever, through some marvellous co-incidence, finds himself flying alongside his family's plane that is looking for him. so he jumps on to their plane, the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after. the fact is, there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it. and it's that charm that is utterly devoid from 'flight of the reindeer' there isn't much wrong with it; nothing which insults the intelligence (well, obviously there is, but it's a kids film and thus can get away with such things) or anything particularly offensive, but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either. it just doesn't feel christmassy. and for a film that is all about christmas, that it a pretty major flaw. but hey, i don't think 'flight of the reindeer's target audience mind about that? why should they? they're all so doped up on sedatives they probably couldn't spell `christmas' i give it three out of ten. if it was a tv-movie then i'd add another two stars onto it. we all know how bad they can get.

the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film, but i was truly disappointed. they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over, which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project. as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in, although beau bridges, as nick, did have a moment or two. if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume. it was an embarrassment. i had been a fan since his waltons days, but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offering.in defence of the actors, the directing was stilted, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish.i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film. however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back, even though it was on t.v.

this thing was bad. really bad. i mean, low budget can sometimes be very inspiring, but not this. the story was so off-the-shelf, the alien's behaviour so illogical, the characters so clichéed. i found nothing good in it. and i did try.

i'm a big fan of movies that make you think. i'm still thinking long and hard about this one, fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled. what's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body, made extra-tacky by being filmed on cheap video. this happens three times and i was certain it would be explained in the end. i put my trust in the film-makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified. it was not.the movie has to be the most apathetic i've come across in the genre. the sets look like a cross between a 1970s dr who set and someone's ill-formed idea of a sponge-painted living room. the lighting is unimaginative (if your sets are going to be that bad, at least film them in semi-darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance). of the abducted quartet, the girl stands out as being particularly lame, but none of them is given a personality. the aliens' plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved. most of the movie consists of people running down corridors. yes, it really is that exciting. the "ray gun" special effect is ... curious, to say the least (what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill, and even then the guy comes back for more?). the script is like a bad episode of the a-team, and the ladies' hairstyles come from the same era, so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders. when we finally get to see what the aliens really look like, they're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes. the resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who's never had an idea more complex than a saturday morning cartoon (i mean the bad ones with no plot, action, or characterization) in his or her life.but seriously, what is with the naked chick?! was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the dvd cover to boost sales?

pyare mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. the film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. vivek oberoi and fardeen khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. while black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, pyare mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. anu malik's music is fair enough. vivek oberoi who made a promising start with saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in hindi cinema. fardeen khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. amrita rao and esha deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. boman irani, as the villainous don toni, is somewhat acceptable. avoid the film if possible.

after the reasonably successful masti which was tad better inder kumar returned again with a comedy pyaare mohan based on the hollywood film see no evil, hear no evil the film reminds you of hum hai kamaal ke(1994) where kader and anupam play the blind and deafthis movie is a tedious exercisethe film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't feel like laughing like snehal dabi's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don't laugh at now but mock the film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all ott chase scenes and fight scenesdirection by inder kumar is bad music is okay, one song stands out i love you my angelvivek is awful in the comic scenes, his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes for some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career fardeen khan is tad better but too wooden amongst the rest esha and amrita are the heroines boman irani annoys here snehal dabbi is okay

this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood. the performances were horrible. even boman irani, who always manages to shine, goes completely ott as the villain. the soundtrack is not memorable either. and in spite trying hard, the female leads don't manage to be "sexy". vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being. but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor. esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written cliché roles. it's high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat. hope he never directs another eyesore like this. future of hindi movies are in better hands now. to sum it up, stay far away from waste of celluloid.

dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like indra kumar. the movie followed with beta, ishq, raja & masti all of whom were superb.but then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too. pyare mohan is one such movie.though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh. comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb.if you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please don't watch this. because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.in short, the movie is worth a miss.

this was director von stroheim's third effort - it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks, greed and the wedding march. essentially we have a trio of grifters, masquerading as a russian count and two russian princesses who have rented a villa in monte carlo. their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune. part of that plan is for the count (von stroheim) to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his "foolish" wife, wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses. he makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid, whom he has promised to marry. when she sees them together, she sets fire to the room, (von stroheim and his prey are on the room's balcony). here von stroheim first establishes his persona as "the man you love to hate." he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end. the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director. there is a cute bit- when he first attempts to meet the ambassador's wife, she is reading a book - we see the title - foolish wives by erich von stroheim. this was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film, cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage (damaged in some way in most scenes) from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print.

three russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of monte carlo, despite the fact they are down to their last franc. in order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter, and use the notes at the casinos, hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot. andrew hughes, a us envoy, arrives at monaco with his wife helen, and the three decide to make pals with the visitors, hoping for financial assistance. one of the three russians, count sergius karamzin, plans to go further, with continuous advance towards helen, while disappointing the count's maid, who loves sergius. eventually, circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. its obvious that von stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of american women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats), rather than tell a story, and the film really can bore modern audiences, like me, easily by doing that. even the acting, which is great in later evs like greed and the wedding march, is just run of the mill here. the film could have used improvements on various levels. rating, 3.

this movie is like the material s.e. hinton was writing in the 1970s and copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s, and, had trueblood actually been a product of either, the results might've been much better (especially in the acting department). instead, we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.jeff fahey plays ray trueblood, a former street rumbler, i suppose is the accurate description. this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music. nonetheless, ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother, donny (chad lowe in a part where he screams a lot), who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when, on the run from the cops, he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the marines. flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor defended in the action film sense) before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother, donny.for the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. for me, most of this has to do with far too much overacting, although not by fahey or sherlyn fenn who plays the waitress he befriends. the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street toughs. although, the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989.

why do movie makers always go against the author's work? i mean, yes, things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest, but look at anne of green gables. they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. i can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess. look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . paul irving, little elizabeth, the widows, windy poplars . . . and anne's college years, for heaven's sake!!! wouldn't it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang? kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. this movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! but l.m. montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied. this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life.

we faw down aspect ratio: 1.33:1sound format: silent(black and white - short film)stan 'n' ollie get mixed up with a couple of floozies (kay deslys and vera white) after setting out to visit a theatre which burns down in their absence! needless to say, their tyrannical wives (vivien oakland and bess flowers) are not amused...leo mccarey's ok comedy laid the narrative framework for william seiter's masterpiece sons of the desert (1934), with l&h playing brow-beaten victims of circumstance, forced to tell a monstrous lie which backfires in spectacular fashion. much of it is very funny, especially the scene in which stan is teased by deslys, leading to a violent game of push and shove. however, some of the fun is undercut by oakland and flowers, playing their roles completely straight, which adds an element of unpleasantness to the 'henpecked husband' scenario. originally released in the uk as we slip up.

this is one of those topics i can relate to a little more than most people as i hate noise & have no idea how those in big cities, new york especially how people get any sleep at all! it astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. the basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. it's too bad that's about it. tim robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking margarita leiveva) he didn't seem to really be altogether there. my biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot, margarita levieva. she doesn't have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door. it makes me sad that there can be people such as paris hilton & kim kardashian in the world w/no redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. i didn't care for much of this film because the script isn't very good, but am glad i got to see some new talent. i hope that producers & directors think about margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film. if they can make megan fox a star (c'mon she isn't that hot, & her acting "talent" is worse than made-for disney channel tv shows) from 1 film, it should happen easily for her, as she is gorgeous & has talent! i'd recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. here's hoping this makes her career, & if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years.

what "noise" fails to do is get us to understand its character. tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. it's an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as "death wish." it is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel, "i'm too stupid to be understanding this." he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and don't get it either.just then a car alarm goes off. throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona. the film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. no, "noise" isn't all-bad. william hurt is at least colorful. at least the ending doesn't fall flat. overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven't probably thought of. at least i hadn't. though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn't have ended sooner. the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably won't get picked up for distribution. check it out on dvd if you're really partial to someone involved in the project. otherwise skip it.

i've been using imdb for a few years now, but have never written any reviews before. however, this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that i couldn't keep quiet anymore.noise is the story of a new yorker (tim robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante, "the rectifier", and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding.i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. there is really no other focus. when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of robbins' character. yes, we're all annoyed by noise. nobody likes the sound of car alarms. of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. i say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. honestly, it's eye-rolling.robbin's character, very shortly into the movie, becomes completely unrelatable. it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore, and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy, the rectifier. however... the transformation doesn't take place. he just renames himself.i could go on for a while. annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie, and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves robbins face doesn't help either. overall, i think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it's pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. just one guy's opinion, cheers.

mirror. mirror (1990) is a flat out lame movie. why did i watch movies like this when i was younger? who knows? maybe i was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another. i don't know, i guess i needed a hobby during my teen years. a teenage outcast (rainbow harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror. soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her. movies like these, the power giver has a nasty side effect. this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not.a mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d.v.d. a few years back. i don't know why. they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. people love this movie foe some reason. if you do i would like to know why. until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it again.not recommended at all.

i got mirror mirror mainly because yvonne de carlo was in it (i thought she was great in american gothic) but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film. it starts off ok and the pace moves along nicely...but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull. that's not to say that this is a boring film, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. i didn't like the "posession" side of it and there were no decent gore scenes. plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending doesn't make much sense at all. i did however like the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors.i wouldn't particularly recommend mirror mirror to horror fans - it's nothing to wet yourself over.

`in the tradition of 'carrie' and 'heathers'? try `a shameless ripoff of not only those two films, but 'the evil dead' and 'the shining' as well.' that said, they really don't make bad horror movies like this anymore, and that's a shame, 'cause it's a gas.rainbow harvest is the winona substitute here, and although she barely does more than mumble her lines (and occasionally scream, `you're ugly!!!' into her haunted mirror), she's goth way before it's fashionable, so you have to respect her. (and she's quite creative about it too, accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black-spray-painted hawaiian-punch-guy hat. eat your heart out, cher.)karen black overacts a bit, but she's not totally without dignity, and you can't help but sympathize with her. (unless you're a certain friend of mine, who asked, `who is that, horse lips from 'm.a.s.h'?' the first time she came onscreen.)there are decent supporting performances by kristin dattilo (as the square chick who befriends rainbow), ricky paull goldin (in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role), and william `larry, darryl and darryl' sanderson (as some kind of pet undertaker, or something). but it's sad to see the once smokin' yvonne decarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte rae part.the eighties were the heyday for hilarious, mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this, and `mirror, mirror' was one of the last of its kind. definitely worth a look.

a typical goth chick (rainbow harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, karen black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. the acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. this film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. people looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of "friday the 13th: the series" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. that packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films.my grade: d eye candy: charlie spradling provides the obligatory t&a

another priyadarshan/vohra flick another movie that was seen for tp rather than actual desire, the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (akshay paresh and many others), but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.i was happy with the casting in general except, rajpal yadav who once again annoys to no limit, he does however extract some laughs, but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol, i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great.which brings us to the other instrument, the dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like rajpal yadav, good analogy), but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the dhol does.this movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. and like any 24 year old sooner than later i got bored.the movie has some good dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating), the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on "mere bhains ko anda kyun mara" (if you haven't watched it watch it on filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).this movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except rajpal yadav (who can act though, i've seen him in main meri patni) who annoys more than entertains, i've said it many time and i'll say it again i really think sharman joshi and tushar kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies especially.some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father, the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.but after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added, this mean that once the girl was in, the following 45-60 mins was increasingly torturous, the climax was "so bad its almost good category", i mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.the movie is also extremely predictable, there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here, its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.the movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition, the last 10-15 was especially distatefull and completely spoils this movie.i didn't find tanushree datta quite the siren she was to play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in view of her non-appealing looks, if you cant be a hot and cant act how much time can you survive.technically also this movie was weak, with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera-work.the songs except the title track were no good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half i could feel the collective gasp from the audience.in all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast, and the very low expectations.avoiding it wont be a bad idea.and if it has to be watched watching it on tv for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.-s lots of stale jokes, rajpal yadav, last 45 mins and last 15 mins especially, bad technically, bad songs.+/-s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (i'm happier for it), tanushree datta.+s some good scenes towards the beginning,title song, good acting and cast except ry.total 4.5/10 (i'm trying to be objective here, i don't like rajpal yadav or tanushree datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations, so i'm giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4)

the movie starts with a nice song looks like a thriller, with arbaaz khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy with the routine stupid idiots like golmaal with tusshar, sharman, kunal and rajpal acting like grown up kids their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring there is a bored sub plot of tanushree's brother being killed towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of hera pheri and wait, there is also a long chase in payal's housethe film is so boring that it makes you fall asleepdirection by priyan is very bad music(pritam) is routine except the first songcinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look throughoutrajpal yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films but no, he becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible sharman is the saving grace, he is the sole actor who acts very well in this film kunal khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, but doesn't impress much tanushree is bad as always arbaaz khan gets less scope and is usual payal is a non actress murli sharma is terrible

priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. that is what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama, hera pheri and hunchul, his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i can't recollect for now. now with hideous films like dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. speaking of the acting, i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came tusshar kapoor, then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. the grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.the plot was the same, seen before one. four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. there is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. and at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.the worst thing about the movie is its length. after an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. but being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie. the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.if your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.

this is your typical priyadarshan movie--a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission. his signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money. whether it is a winning lottery ticket in malamaal weekly, black money in hera pheri, "kodokoo" in phir hera pheri, etc., etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. don't get me wrong; as clichéd and preposterous his movies may be, i usually end up enjoying the comedy. however, in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor, (hungama and hera pheri being noteworthy ones). now, the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.songs are good. tanushree datta looks awesome. rajpal yadav is irritating, and tusshar is not a whole lot better. kunal khemu is ok, and sharman joshi is the best.

a battleship is sinking... its survivors, hanging onto a nearby liferaft, sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks.even though noel coward's name is the only one that you notice during the credits, everything that's cinematic in it is because of lean. and on technical terms, its very good. david lean just knew films from the get-go. there are many moments where coward's studied dialogue takes a second seat and lean's visual sense takes centre stage. try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end, and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing, the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed.noel coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen. he's totally wooden, not displaying emotion, character or humanity. you can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying, he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line.7/10.its episodic, a bit repetitive, and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story that they advance, just give general insights into the characters. still, its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for lean. its not a very deep or penetrating film, and its definitely a propaganda film, but its also a showcase for lean's editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together.

noel coward,a witty and urbane man,was friends with louis mountbatten.mr coward,a long-time admirer of all things naval,was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of mountbatten's ship.in a peculiarly british way it was considered that a film about the royal navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda.it was also considered a good idea to have mr coward play the part of the ship's captain.amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship,the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated "point" songs does not come very high up the list at admiralty house,or at least one would hope not.a captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike. mr coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at drury lane and binkie beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ship's crew in wartime must be brought into question.he folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. much is made of the "warship as a microcosm of british society"theme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.they spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up. never mind,there's plenty more where they came from.once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up .by contrast mr coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.he,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.that nice young master johnny mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships mr coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.he marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. so yes,we do have a microcosm of british society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of "in which we serve" intended. at the end mr coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him,"goodbye edwards,it was a privilege to sail with you"he enunciates as if he was reciting "how now brown cow". it may have been david lean's feature debut,but the hand of noel coward looms large right across this picture.he was a funny and clever man,better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song.he had a talent to amuse,no doubt,but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue. being noel coward was a full-time job,he had no time to be a real person.

wow. what a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. here are just a few gripes. - the screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book. - plot has been grotesquely altered. - voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages (which may read well but are not the same when spoken, especially with chabon's writing style). - the acting is more wooden than a log cabin. (esp. bechstein) - this is supposed to be set in 1983??? feels more like 2003... to be fair i couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it's possible that it redeemed itself... (sarcasm). i truly hope that no one paid to see this, or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent (a la wonder boys). i like chabon as a writer but he should be ashamed of this adaptation.no stars.

...they bothered making this movie? anyone? i didn't think so.if you are looking for a coming-of-age movie, go rent summer of '42. this is no summer of '42.when your big stars are nolte & sarsgaard, & sarsgaard gets more screen time, that is your first warning sign and, of course, for such an "artsy" movie, there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around, just to make it look "artsy".sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense. the intensity is that of someone with bi-polar disorder.miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of pittsburgh after this movie. pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her. she misrepresented an actual pittsburgh native.foster gave sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style. wow! was this his first role after high school graduation?so, we have this weird triangle. foster has a crush on miller, but is with his boss/girlfriend. he can't take miller to bed, & won't take his boss to bed. so, he hangs with sarsgaard & miller, & watches them get it on.then, after one of sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, foster & miller get it on, a scene that we are "treated" to in every sloppy, moaning detail. finally, just to round it all out, foster & sarsgaard get it on, with foster in the miller role. now i know how 2 guys get it on (as if that was ever anything i needed to know).after all that, all that's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2. it gets me right in the pit of my stomach. oh, wait! that was the pepperoni pizza i just had.i'd like back the time this movie took out of my life, please.

a friend of mine gave me this movie. a friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a dvd casing from his ***. i got quit excited by the prospects of an other michael chabon movie. after all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great, but boy, was i wrong.first off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so. i imagine the castings went something like this. "tell me, do you like fish?" "yes i enjoy fish very much." "wonder full, you're hired. have some money." than there is the script. i have read chabon, who i hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. i'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did, but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out.this is an actual line from the movie; "if you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before, than this moment becomes unique!" unique? does it? does it really? off course not you plank. please pass me the imodium. i'll have a whole ****ing strip. the directing is... well. i've got nothing. maybe rawson marshall thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something. stick to directing comedies. no stick to directing commercials. this movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age. i give it 2 stars because i don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie.

based on the novel by michael chabon, the mysteries of pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. the year is 1983, and young art bechstein (jon foster) is at a crossroads. completely opposed to his father's lifestyle, art plans to become a stockbroker. visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like mena suvari, sienna miller and nick nolte. like so many of the star-laden premieres at sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right.

i am quite a fan of novelist/screenwriter michael chabon. his novel "wonder boys" became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson. his masterful novel "the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay" won the pulitzer prize a few years back, and he had a hand in the script of "spider man 2", arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time.director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces, such as the gut-busting "dodgeball" and the genius short film series "terry tate: office linebacker". and with a cast including peter saarsgard, sienna miller, nick nolte and mena suvari, this seems like a no-brainer.it is. literally.jon foster stars as art bechstein, the son of a mobster (nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in economics. jon is in a state of arrested development: he works a minimum wage job at book barn, has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend/boss, phlox (suvari), which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex, with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion.one night at a party, an ex-roommate introduces jon to jane (miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. later that night they go out for pie, and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence, "i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul. if you do, it will make this night indelible." jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by, yet none of them look him in the eye. "i imagine it must be what death feels like," he says.the next day jane's wild boyfriend cleveland (saarsgard) kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill, and soon jon, cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts, doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. this doesn't sit well with phlox, who pushes jon for a more personal relationship, namely letting her meet his new friends and his father. the film then attempts to take us on jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father, phlox and his dead-end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and jane.there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film: he's completely uninteresting. he has no ambitions, passions or goals. he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met. at the outset this isn't a problem. but he never gets any more interesting. he's a completely passive character. he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane, but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party, have sex and get in arguments. in other words, much ado about nothing. what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside. sweeping cinematography, ponderous voice-over with characters staring off into the distance, lots of sex scenes both straight and gay, big arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a tragic death... but it doesn't seem to matter. ironically, at one point jane, confused at a number of jon's aimless actions, asks him, "what's going on, jon? what is this all about?" yes, jon, do tell. we in the audience are dying to know, too.the title "the mysteries of pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. they are all facades, one-dimensional stand-ins for actual people. the film never lets us in. we never know what makes any of them tick. we see them do lots of things, but we don't know why. and the absence of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.

cecil b. demille's 1922 parlor-to-prison tearjerker manslaughter finds the lovely leatrice joy as a good-at-heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with. her recklessness leads to imprisonment, which in turn leads to her regeneration. thomas meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in lydia (joy) but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released, it is up to her to rescue him!if the plot doesn't sound too bad, you'll be floored by the woeful presentation. the quality of demille's direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him. the photography is standard and flat, and the editing is hardly more dynamic. one could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct. demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes (evening gowns, golfing costumes, motoring costumes, piles of furs) that it's subtitle could be 'fashions of 1922'one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting, which is mostly flat and wooden. when it is not, it is merely routine silent gesturing, rolling eye balls, twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements. what would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films, is here merely dull to watch. the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson, who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally. she is convincing and endearing in tearful close-ups, as long as you don't read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak. like i said, everybody else is droningly routine, joy, meighan, even julia faye. her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom.the worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it. meighan's character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of america is declining in it's moral stance, and going right back to the decadence of rome. (insert absurd flashback) this movie's moralizing has been described as victorian, but it's further than that. it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didn't take it any more seriously than modern viewers could.this movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a 'typical' silent movie, with it's archaic moral structure, wooden acting and bad direction. demille shows that he could be a terrible director, with no sense of pacing, camera placement, or skill in handling either script or actors. i can't imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously. boring, slow and idiotic, i recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only.

i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie "far north", and even though i loved her in her one other film "slow" (2004) where she plays "francis", this is by far and away her strongest role.lynn, as i'm sure you all know (or should), plays the critical role of "driver".unfortunately, other than lynn's amazing performance, i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it.oh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers. memorable lines like: "you son-of-a-gun!", "you son-of-a-witch!", "shoot!", and "well, forget you!"o.k. bye.p.s.: does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster?

of all the films i have seen, this one, the rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. the direction, logic, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. "how could anyone come up with something so crappy"? gary busey is know for his "b" movies, but this is a sure "w" movie. (w=waste).take for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. inside the jeep is ma and is "confused" as to why all the cops are about. within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, ma being killed straight off. the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.

revolt of the zombies is bad. there is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. it is dull, lifeless, poorly acted, and poorly scripted. i've often complained that the original dracula is a little slow for my taste, well this movie makes dracula look like a roller coaster ride. the 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes.the story: an expedition is sent to cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification". one man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. that's it. that's the whole story.for most of the movie, i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead. he looked so familiar. i had plenty of time to think this over. nothing was happening in the movie. just before the "zombies revolted", it hit me. it was dean jagger. i had seen him recently as the general in white christmas. this is how i "entertained" myself throughout most of the movie.i'm just glad i didn't buy the dvd for this movie. king of the zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. for what it's worth, i'll give it a 2/10. (i won't go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, i've seen worse.)

with this movie only running 61 minutes and nothing all that good on television, i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time. even while realizing the era from which it was coming, i was sorely disappointed. it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score (what - no brooding music?) and then the rather slow moving opening sequences. gosh, i figured a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have some chills to it (white zombie, with bela lugosi, certainly did) but this had none. zero. it was scarcely even dramatic (except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone). like the equally dull king of the zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.

revolt of the zombies starts with armand louque (dean jagger) trying to convince general duval (george cleveland) that his mate tsiang (william crowell) is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people & render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies (a bit like the people i work with really). anyway, tsiang is murdered by colonel mazovia (roy d'arcy) but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies. an expedition has been set up by general duval to hunt for the secret since tsiang ain't going to tell them much anymore. general duval heads the expedition along with his daughter claire (dorothy stone) who is engaged to louque who also comes along. during the expedition claire dumps louque for his mate clifford grayson (robert noland) at which louque isn't too pleased about. in a way that could only happen in a film louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself & starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire & clifford... co-written & directed by victor halperin revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation & after watching it i can see why. the script by halperin, howard higgin & rollo lloyd all uncredited, has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull & as exciting as watching paint dry. nothing much happens for ages & then nothing much happens afterwards either. how halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie, these zombies are just brainwashed people & filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a.romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead (1968). at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long. technically the film is ok considering it was made 70 years ago, the black & white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location. the acting is wooden & largely unimpressive. revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it hasn't dated well & in 2005 it's an absolute chore to sit through. i believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd compilations & budget labels, but it's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for.

of the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago, i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong. what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing. how much longer? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously.that's staggering; what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here? their previous film, "white zombie", was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films (the mummy, dracula, etc.), and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines.revolt of the zombies, to the contrary, appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war. this would not only explain the opening, and the change of dean jagger's character into a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film, besides stand around, look frightening, and wait for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and loathe in zombie films.i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but i think a film ought to be entertaining first, and only later, maybe, educational. and definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombies.truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history, but not one i can recommend, even for historic value.

"after world war i, an expedition representing the allied countries is sent to cambodia to stop the efforts of count mazovia in creating a zombie like army of soldiers and laborers. hoping to prevent a possible outbreak of war due to mazovia's actions, the group presses through the jungle to angkor wat in spite of the perils. the group includes armand who has his own agenda contrary to the group's wishes," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. heads up! the zombie make-up department revolted before the cameras started to roll. also, this "revolt of the zombies" has little to do with its supposed predecessor "white zombie" (1932) *****, which starred bela lugosi. if that film's zombies didn't thrill you, this one's certainly won't. a younger-than-usual dean jagger (as armand louque) stars as a man obsessive with blonde dorothy stone (as claire duval). a couple supporting performances are good: devilish roy d'arcy (as mazovia) and subservient teru shimada (as buna); however, neither are given enough material to really pull this one out of the dumps.** revolt of the zombies (1936) victor halperin ~ dean jagger, dorothy stone, roy d'arcy

the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it is pretty far down on the list. when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. and he succeeds, at least at first. a love triangle complicates the story some.this really was a tedious movie, with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't. the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable (not the zombie part of it but parts related to the "romance"). and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography, the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either.while i have seen a few movies that are worse, this is unlikely to please anyone. it's bad, and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way.

before the release of george romero's genre-defining night of the living dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. they certainly had much better table-manners in the old days. but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public? judging by this film, none whatsoever.the story is about an expedition to cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army.this film is basically a love triangle with zombies. but seeing as this is a 30's movie, the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. they seem to respond to mind-control, rather than insatiable appetites. and, quite frankly, the 'revolt' is somewhat underwhelming too. the whole thing is really very dull. aside from the lack of horror, there isn't any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. it seems unlikely that this could've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. see it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one.

i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set. i am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter, which makes most of these movies a laugh riot.i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies, after watching white zombie, which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema (think clive barker's serpent and the rainbow and james bond's live and let die funeral scene, not night of the living dead).however, even though the title includes the word "zombies," it is little more than a love triangle, involving anthropologist armand louque, who is smitten with claire duval; who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson. what a yawn-fest, my daughter fell asleep half-way through.i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for -- the allies or the axis; but, i guess that doesn't really matter.i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie; but, of course those were his eyes (from white zombie) serving as the mind-control device for the zombies.

i think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. bad is actually better than boring. this thing has no breath. it does have the interesting fact of taking place in cambodia. how many american made films of the 30's take place in cambodia. nevertheless, the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. even the troop movements are a little confusing. what drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde i don't know. i thought he should continue to use his zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. the movie just plods along. the perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. i thought they would never get there. one guy takes two steps. he stops. he looks around. the other guy hides behind some columns. he takes two steps. he stops. he looks around. the other guy hides behind some bushes. this is the movie in a nutshell. then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. i actually have a lot of patience when it comes to b movies. this one is insufferable. by the way, a more apt title would be revolt of the hypnotized.

the film must have been shot in a day,there are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red pointer,even the scenery's green light that blends with the actors!!!the plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest inspiration(at least as a thriller genre movie).everything that got to do with poe in the movie,has a shallow and childish approach.the film is full of clise and no thrilling.if you want to watch a funny b-movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it (as i did) but there's no way to take this film seriously!

i don't usually comment, but there are things that need to be said. where to start...the acting, on jeremy london's part was horrible! i didn't think he could be so bad. the plot could have been good, had it been well directed, along with a good solid performance from the lead actor. unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining, but get disappointed from the start. well, at least i got good laughs. i wouldn't waste my time if i were you.

...though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror, there was a distinct lack of blood.there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing, acting, editing, and script-writing.jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i've ever seen - his "descent into the maelström" of madness is achingly self-aware and clumsy. oh look at him twitch! oh look at him drink strong spirits! oh look at him raise his brow, and cock his head at a jaunty angle! oh look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! oh listen to his affectedly husky voice! he must be a tortured artist/writer/genius! oh, yes, out comes the poet-shirt - it's another boy who thinks he's byron. (or poe.) oh for the love of... did someone give this guy a manual on "how to act good" or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere, the defunct little plastic toy-prize in a discontinued brand of bargain-bin cereal. okay, that was a stupid line - but that's only because london's performance has melted my brain with its awfulness.katherine heigl is cute, and very briar rose, but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film - she delivered her lines like she was being held up, in fact, her whole performance was very wooden, her poses as stiff as her lines - who knows, perhaps she was just reacting to, and trying to neutralise, jeremy london's flailing excesses, but if that's the case, she takes it too far.notable is arie verveen as poe - while his character's role is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. he, quite simply, looks right, but it's more than that - he has some sort of depth, i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. huh, maybe it's just because i like poe, and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen - whatever, he had an interest factor otherwise missing.the rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures: the perky blonde best-friend who's a bit of a floozy; the smitten local cop who's a bit of a dork; the protective older man who perhaps has too much un-fatherly interest in our heroine; the scheming old witch, etc., etc., yawn, yawn. as with the 'distinct lack of blood for a horror movie' issue, none of the themes that they mention (and that london's character mentions - so scathingly - in his attack on poe's writing) are followed through on. as another reviewer said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - genuinely shocking stuff, but instead they skirt away from the issues, and cut away from the violence (a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing in on it's victim - then---cut to black! this is fine in a noirish traditional horror, indeed, it's expected, and is fondly received when it happens - it's a dear convention, especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup - but in 'descendant' it just comes across as clumsy, or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out.) this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis/delusion/madness - or a simple (and fun) slasher movie: it tries to be both, or neither (something new and exciting!), but either way it fails dismally. the only horror element of this entire movie is it's epic dullness.i think the editor (if there was one at all) must have been drunk when s/he chopped this thing up - there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes; scenes that appeared to be out of order (but that could have just been the poor script). likewise the director & cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning, but just ended up looking silly (again, fine in a noir, but this was trying to be something else.)the whole thing perhaps may have been funny (in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned - "omg how did this get made?!?") if i had been in the mood for some trash- bagging, unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch, with the lights down low, with the express intention of scaring myself silly - this is a very poor film, and i'm afraid i can't recommend it to people, not even for laughs.please, please, don't waste your time or money on this - either borrow a real horror/thriller film, or find yourself a copy of poe's fantastical tales, either way, you'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish.

i watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on fox kids in the uk (very late at night). i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. it's just plain awful! it is no where near in the same league as the transformers, he-man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (that's if mask doesn't put me to sleep first). one of the lesser 80's cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids!

i saw this film at its new york's high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore. although it was funny in some places, the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden, especially the "lovely lady" and the voice of the narrator (whom i have never heard of) had a lot to be desired. j.c.mac was, i felt, the redeeming feature of this film, true action and grit and (out of the cast) the only real acting. i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing, this could have been a half decent film. let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release, or if you really want a copy, look in the bargain bin in lidl.

this should be a great film... meryl streep and jack nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. mike nichols directing. uh uh. it's dull dull dull! pointless and predictable! slow and unfocused!it's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy' story. now theres an original concept! after squirming through two hours (was it only two? it felt like six.)i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. it was done in 1986. i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget. i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade. it's not that it's such a bad picture. it's just that it's such an un-good one.

the movie was watchable while nicolson was on the screen. however, i had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on meryl streep to carry scenes without jack; she was as bland as could be. the relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been portrayed before -- and much better. it felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring, and not worth writing about or watching. why ephron felt her life and relationship with carl bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me. perhaps she wrote it as therapy -- for many writers, putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic. fine: but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me.

you could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that statement wrong. most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to. they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways. the story is very simple. it could be summed up in a few words, but i'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film.i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. i'd have to say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. quite frankly, i'd rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth. personally, i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.outside of my own personal dementia, the film really lacked anything worth it's time. there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging. when something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry.best not to look this one up.

i just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. these other reviewers aren't joking around, this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. it really does. like the "director" took the family hi8 camcorder (before dv cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. no script, just making it up as he went along.when i watched it, it was on my mono tv, so i only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong. the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. they recorded the sound on different bloody channels! i mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. i'm not sure this is one of those. i mean, i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better, you know. but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.as bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. but alas, no. if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity. worked for roger corman.

i saw this movie a few days ago... what the hell was that?i like movies with brian o'halloran, they are funny and enjoyable. when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great, this one could be really good... some parody for slashers or another gore movies... but.. then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway... but it wasn't...my opinion: if like movies they look little bit like documentary, with little bit of comedy try some moore's movies or alien autopsy, they are really about something. this one was empty. and put a comedy to title... no comment... really bad joke

i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better. don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential. the premise is good, the cast is great (i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton) and, god love 'em, you can tell everyone tried their best. it just falls short over and over again. "brutal massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and, despite the fact he makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. naughton and brian o'halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often...they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me. if you're going to have the "spinal tap" of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made "spinal tap" to helm it...just thinking out loud there.

roman polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. his fame bewilders me. nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown (i haven't seen 'knife in the water' or 'tess'). any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (the pianist, frantic, oliver twist, the ninth gate, pirates).r's baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. it's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). but this is just misconceived horror sap. everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. it did not sustain my interest. i find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. there's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil.the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential.

lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires. as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together.great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film. yes its a sexy vampire story. no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women. to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great, but other than that...for those who want to see sexy vampires only.

yes, this is one of those movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. i have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie. the other comments give the idea well enough. the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses.but the rat, yes, the big rat. why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. often the 'big one' isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. i surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry.the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. after figuring out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. if you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. really, you need to rent it and see for yourself.but not for more than 99¢, ok?

i enjoy quality crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. i quite enjoyed some of this, but the acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. i don't know who wasted more time, me watching this, or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. i can assure you, it wont. however, on a brighter note, i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie, so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.

nell shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the maxwell automobile's off-road capabilities. the plot of the movie is pretty simple, nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer's block, and needs inspiration, so she goes to visit mexico to absorb the atmosphere. there she meets the hero (bert van tuyle), a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. while nell is visiting with her father's partner at his mining camp, a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. the hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. this is where the film takes a weird twist. bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brush, scraggly tree stumps, steep inclines, etc etc, for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. now mind you, this isn't a modern-day atv, it's a 1920 maxwell automobile, so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle. and it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters, we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. but the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl, he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit (on horseback), and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks, getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush, going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs, the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. but they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. and in a silly climax, the car climbs a mountainside, and helps nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.after seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than hummers and bradley tanks combined. watch this film just for laughs, it's worth it just to see nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying "you did your best, brave little car"

being a fan of silent films, i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. i was pretty disappointed. as has been mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long, commercial for the maxwell automobile. perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is, i may have enjoyed the film more. but it got old very fast. and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without lessening a viewer's enjoyment, what was with the mexican bandits? i mean, they are chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour, yet they can't catch up to it?

nell shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in 'back to god's country' of the previous year, and she failed miserably. this time, she does better, although it seems pointless. 'something new' hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase. there's a brief premise, which sets up the hero (co-author and shipman's boyfriend) to have to save the girl (played by shipman), then it's nothing but an exciting, implausible chase from there. of course, it plays out like an hour-long advertisement for a maxwell sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. it doesn't seem that she learned much from the last-minute rescue films of d.w. griffith or its parodies by mack sennett and other comedians, which she's imitating.one point of interest is that shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film's story, which has as its protagonist a writer (shipman again), although she doesn't do much else clever or humorous with it, even though she attempts to. again, others had pioneered the writer's joke in the intertitles, like anita loos with 'wild and woolly' or frances marion with 'a girl's folly' (both 1917). at least, shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously--and neither do i. 'something new,' despite its claim, is hackneyed.

i just saw this movie on flix after timer-taping it. i grew up watching f troop and had a major hard for wrangler jane so i was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was melody patterson, who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. i would never have guessed it was her in a million years. what the hell is she doing in a picture like this? i agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing. no sex, no gore, no tease. it's also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being roughed up by the cop, all of it boring and time-filling. now if the italians would have made this, half the film would have been the slingblade/uncle ernest/jack elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls. but you only get that for 20 seconds.

the film released at the start of 2000 alongwith mela both disasters so sad to start a millennium with such nonsensethe film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000anywayz some classic gems from the film: paresh rawal i don't understand to laugh at his role or cry reason: he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here?the whole film is a joke can't explain we have anil in a dual role(one older and younger) and rekha playing the older's wife and raveena the youngers we also have reject harish while shakti playing the son of aruna irani who both fight on who has the worst wigdirection is outdated music is badanil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate, raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo

t. rama rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. he's like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.actors are not bad, not good either. anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. rekha is good, but then - she's always good, and here she's nothing more than such. she makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that. in conclusion, nothing great at all. raveena is ok, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing.this film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. maybe it's a delayed film? well, even then it still would be below standard. the script is terrible, the film is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. it feels like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like from the 1950s.don't recommend, unless you're a big fan one of the starring actors.

wwf survivor series 2001this was among the worst events of 2001. perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous survivor series'. there was only one survivor series match. and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes. what's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock prevailing for his team. and don't get me started on the preview before the event. no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f***ing die. there was no need for all of that pointless hype. whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event.and as for the rest of the matches: the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow. it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly. william regal versus tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. edge versus test was good but nothing great. the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place. the women's title match wasn't great. no, not in the slightest. the main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history. the alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned. the match itself was poor. the rock eliminated 3 of them and jericho eliminated 2. the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began. jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match. if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them. everyone knew that kane, big show and undertaker were just fall guys. 7 matches isn't enough for a survivor series. if there's ever a survivor series as bad as this again i'll

this was allocated to the fans as the "winner takes all" match occurred between two separate "companies" (the world wrestling federation and the "alliance": an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars. because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag-team match, the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match, interfernce is necessary. each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches, executes a special move, and tags in a partner. the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf. it was obvious, with that statement, that the wwf would prevail. overall: very innovative storyline but poor execution, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag-team. the remaining matches are just revolting:edge versus test: potent "big boot" by test, but this did not display the true talents of both starsal snow versus christian: good match but superflous to the pay-per-viewtaji versus william regal: the worst match of the nightimmunity battle royal: this was an outstandingly fun match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only a wrestler who characteristically appears on "heat" and is probably a wcw light-heavyweight reject (i.e. the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer)hardy boyz versus dudley boyz: the best match of the night: jeff hardy executed a "swanton bomb" from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage, which appeared to be extremely painful.because stone cold was the wwf champion, rob van dam was the hardcore champion, and kurt angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of "the alliance" were granted work after the match's outcome, except for booker t., who recently attacked a wrestler on "raw" and will inevitably be given work. shane mcmahon will return to television somehow, and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of "the alliance" to see stone cold out of work. the wwf has done much better. a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better, and what ever became of casket and iron man matches?

turkish cinema has a big problem. directors aren't interested in global cinema. they are local and folkloric, but want to be international. this brings kitsch results such this movie.film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don't have any meaning for non-turkish audiences. even for turkish audiences after 10 years.players, even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average. they act like puppets.movie was shot in cuba, but nothing includes about cuba. so cuba is thought like a banana republic.waste of money, waste of time.

it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film. an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in "rabbit test." so, as a small contribution to this future effort, i'd like to suggest this word: "hubiriffic" (adj.) a combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film "rabbit test."joan rivers and "hollywood squares" producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. trying to put together an airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags, (note to joan: german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the catskills - that's is bad enough. but compounding this cinematic crime is river's directorial style, which can best be described as 'ugly', and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags.adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel. watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test. cabbages, mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates. but for self-aware, thinking humans - i'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i'd recommend "rabbit test."

i just rented creep and was not at all impressed. i didn't feel anything in this film. i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. haven't we seen this all before? i didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. i felt bad for him. but then again i couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep? so many questions need to be answered.someone mentioned references to the ps2 game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely.not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.

creep - "your journey terminates here." some very graphic scenes and...well, yeah, that's about all for this film.no real plot, no storyline. no likable characters, well, 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is. i mean, they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing? why is he there?), that's quite scary i guess, but do i really care? no, i don't. why don't i? because i don't have a clue who these people are and i don't know if i should want them to live or die. it's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.this film lacks any meaning, any purpose. it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up. it jumps right into the action. basically, some women and her friends get locked in the london underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are ok, but that isn't what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.it's nothing new. another predictable modern 'horror', where kate (the lead 'character') consistently does the stupid "hey, i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! i'm going to do the total opposite because i'm a dumb blond" thing. i wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. in fact, i'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the, erm, grey alien-looking creature."your journey terminates here" is the films tag line. well, creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film. if you've had a few beers, got a couple of mates back at yours,then sure, watch it by all means. but if you want something original and clever, avoid.

basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'death line' which ironically was like this cobblers, also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station.making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych, this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not this film's strong point.indeed strong points are sadly lacking. the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device.franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often, indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film, out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin. if you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of death line (aka raw meat).if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film, you will need to change trains.....

this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. there are two routes to take in horror films: either you don't really explain what's going on (or who the killer is, like in texas chainsaw massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained (halloween could potentially be an example of this).unfortunately, creep fails in this area. i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. no character is fully realized, although the circular nature of kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.in the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film.this film will go down as another example of a film (as most are) that could be so much better even though it would never be great. the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting: the characters, story, direction, and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.creep does serve a purpose as a mindless, silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it...

please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen...ever. just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.so, it officially begins with a party. just your average party but there's some guy there. he's pretty into kate...if you know what i'm saying. memorise his face; it'll help later.so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney (didn't i say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. that's london underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. so the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. now kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground. alone. well, almost...so the movie just carries on from there. blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.in short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. or as the case may have it, creep.i'd say give it a go if you're into saw, hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us, scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.

okay i must say that before the revealing of the 'monster'. saying that he really didn't fit into that category, just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing, but anyway. i actually was getting into this film, although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't come as an appeal. but such scenes as when she runs away from the train, and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen.but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror, with limited thrills or scares. slowly i became more bored, and wanted to shut the thing off. i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it, specially the guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are! just boring and well not worth the money.if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a mindless gore fest (which is limited, hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go, but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else, much better films out there.

this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show...but i remembered this as being live-action. i don't think i ever saw the cartoon. but movie? maybe. i remember it very clearly. the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom. he even had the red jacket. it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him. the car/guy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street. and then proceeded to drive off. that is all i remember. i really hope someone else out there remembers this too. if not, maybe i'm still crazy. but i'm hoping i'm not.

wow. the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists. i know a lot of those. the guys that'll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror. this "movie" is utter crap. it looks and sounds like a porno (good lord, the soundtrack is awful...), and has sub-par porn acting, which is shocking, because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor. i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this. most likely "beans, beans, beans.." until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day... they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever, when they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it's the devil's baby?) but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed. it's just awful. like, plan 9 from outerspace awful. like, good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful. try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode.

"masters of horror" has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes,' and while a definite case can be made for joe dante's 'screwfly solution' (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). and 'pro-life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young angelique (caitlin wachs), seen running through the woods, is nearly hit by 2 doctors (mark feuerstein and emmanuelle vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. angelique's father, dwayne (ron perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. if for nothing else, 'pro-life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. even when dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion,' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. the poor performances (perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script, and carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'pro-life' is the source of his next hot meal. by the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking...

well well well. as good as john carpenter's season 1 outing in "masters of horror" was, this is the complete opposite. he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with "cigarette burns" but "pro-life" is perhaps the worst i have seen from him.it's stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome, despite the less-than-an-hour running time. the script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.and for those suckers who actually bought the dvd (one of them being me); did you see how carpenter describes the film? he's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. and in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut, he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. i fear the old master has completely lost his touch. i sincerely hope i'm proved wrong.i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome, though. technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and make up effects.

i went into a video store and looked around to find some horror movies, after about 30 minutes i just rushed and picked out a few. i stumbled upon "masters of horror" which contained "pro-life" and "right to die". they seemed ok, same-old cheesy horror crap, but i was interested for some reason. it said about pro-life on the case about being a classic, a return to form for john carpenter (i loved his "the thing", so i thought this would be good) and all that. so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting, i was very wrong... it started off casual, just a girl running through a forest, scared of something. a car stops and picks her up (just so being the people she needed to see, amazing?) they take her back to some clinic and examine her, at the sametime all this is happening her father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in, he isn't aloud near the area. most likely from something he would of done in the past, but you don't know of any of this at the moment. he really does not want his daughter in this place, an abortion center. he is very strongly against such acts, believing it's sickening and not what "god" would want. he "supports" what i heard is called "pro-life". acting against abortions and going to extremes to allow the babies to be born, they are sick. they don't like the life of an unborn being taken, yet they've killed humans in the past to allow the birth? justice is only a figment of the mind. anyway, back on track, after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant, but far ahead than what she should be. she is only a few weeks pregnant, but is months ahead. she keeps telling them they wont understand her, and that she wants an abortion and all, but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a demon from hell, and that her father wants this baby (but believes "god" wants this baby, not who truly does). he gets his 3 sons (they arm themselves with pistols and shotguns), and begin to make they're way into the clinic (shooting down anyone who won't co-operate). the head of the clinic, who must of had trouble with them in the past, is well prepared this time. ends up killing one the fathers sons, but in the end gets shot a few times (wearing a bullet proof jacket). the father then performs what he believes is done to the women. he cuts a hole, where the vagina would be if he we're a female, and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood. whilst all this is happening, the girl gives birth to some demonic baby with many legs, and some demon raises from beneath the earth (not in the same room) and starts looking for its child. the father sees this later on, and starts questioning why this happened, he did what he was told to do, and doesn't understand why it's like this. the demon had killed both of his sons earlier, and now goes for father... whilst the girl kills the baby, and the demon carries it away (not in the same scene).yeah, it probably sounds pretty cool, and a thrilling horror movie, but it isn't. the acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm, the script is boring and not even creative, they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them; just everything put together, all the small parts, don't even add up to something great, a waste of time. i wouldn't classify this as a horror, though it has elements of horror, they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed. it felt more like a "beginners" short-movie, than by john carpenter.sorry for my lack of information, and detailed review, i just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting. also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect, i couldn't really be bothered to research anything.

i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter's episode in season 2 because his first, cigarette burns, was by far the best from season 1 (and i did like other episodes from that season). oh, how i was disappointed.in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing. the characters, aside from the subject matter, seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker, texas ranger. the acting was bad, and i normally like ron perlman a lot, but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible. i'm not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror (obviously) with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion. in this case, not surprisingly, it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti-abortionists. and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency. this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing.while i don't think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for. there are a couple small bits that i found nice, hence the 2 stars i gave it.the actual gore and monster effects were good, but the cgi gore (two separate gunshots to the head) were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should've never been given the ok. i'm generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle. i have a problem with the execution of it. the technology, while amazing in some respects, is not good enough to match "real" effects, whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and/or alive, and therefore shouldn't be used until they are. cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated.i'll also take this opportunity to note that the show title, masters of horror, is a bad title to have. there simply aren't many actual "masters of horror" around. maybe two or three. if the show were called "tale of horror" or something like that it would be fine. but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes, and therefore being criticized for not being a "master of horror" is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career. and it didn't even have to be a good one.

slight spoilers (but it doesn't matter anyway).an exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines i need to put these remarks on the netwaves. this is the single worst episode of the masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct mystery science theatre treatment. even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very lame mess. its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are put to use. here they are absent and john carpenter is no master. period. and no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that. oddly, carpenter never has been anything more than a b director, but at least such films as 'fog' and 'the thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).abominable acting. camera angles stuck in cement. tensionless rhythm. yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course jc cannot really be blamed for (unless the writers were buddies of cody.) the initial two minute slo-mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be scully-mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film. but come on, a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez-vous with the fender of a pair of 'women's rights' mds whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner. oh, and i won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds. does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.then things fall apart real quick. the vacuous dialogue "i just want to help you", the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of cell phones?) followed by the the shoot-out: a born-again ramboesque clinic director vs ron perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at easter break. another lovely line: "so what are we going to do?" from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. er, no it isn't yet pheasant season. so who needs those teen boys anyway. what about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all-american suv?as for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves, the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a dc comics strip. all that was lacking were the wham, bam, and whiz of the balloon titles. and all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old mannix episode.at one point we learn that daddy isn't really the daddy, but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either. this story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins. yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are actually ever found together. they remain mere abstractions to each other throughout.with the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable. bland, hysterical, dull-headed, macho. as perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. none of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. and there's that bickering dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend. he fortunately got his. there are two great mst-worthy comic moments: the gusher when angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby's head. also cute was angelica's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right-to-life little monster from hell. as for that audacious male abortion scene...well, they should have retained miike's episode and banned this one instead.in short, a 3rd rate rosemary's baby meets alien set on the turf of a m.a.s.h. episode. this stinker alone, appreciable only to today's permissive under-16 generation, will assure as someone else said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. a real shame, since there have been a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs as dante's 'homecoming' or mckee's deliciously quirky 'sick girl'. not to mention the superb imagery of malone's 'fairhaired child'.sorry john carpenter, i believe your directing days are over. it's time to run for president.

the london underground has something inherently creepy about it, with its long winding tunnels, the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground, and of course the rats roaming the tracks.it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often. it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat, featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel, and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london. so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep.i thought the film started off well, with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving, followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london. however, creep went downhill from here, and i found myself wishing that i'd switched it off after this opening scene, leaving me with a favourable impression of the film. all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable, even potente herself, and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness. he also made the mistake of showing the "monster" in full lighting, where he ceases to become remotely scary, and reveals his name to be craig. how can you have a monster called craig? it turns into an x files-type thing, and reminds one of the episode tombs. in fact, i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.as for the infamous sexualised violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally unnecessary. it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value. the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror, which is a mistake as it's only halfway through the film.so there you go. the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell, one of my favourite occasional actors. you don't see him very often, but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius, unfortunately the only one evident in the film.

creep is the story of kate (potente), an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train, and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station. after somehow meeting workmate and would-be rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed, things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city's streets. her story is linked to that of george (blackwood), an ex-con working in the sewer system; they meet in the final third of the film, brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them.the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations; from the tube station, they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery. most tube stations don't have toilets, so how one has a surgery is beyond me. naturally, the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn't have running water. yet it has electricity? just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create.the monster itself is a problem. there's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions, it just kills people for no obvious reason. and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either, perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time. i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary, but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son, and a few shots of some jars containing babies, and yes, it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds. it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak, communicating only in raptor screams, but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay. hmm.this doctor business leads to scene that is the film's desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory, and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch, it just isn't enough. the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed, and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason. george breaks down, unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again, and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard. yeah.after starting out as a "this could happen to anyone" movie, it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic. a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid.

this was an absolutely terrible movie. don't be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside. both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece. the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. maria conchita alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. i am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like christopher walken's good name. i could barely sit through it.

i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale, having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can't lose, it if was rubbish then no loss, if it was any good then bargain...then i watched it...i am normally a fan of christopher walken, but in this film he commanded very little screen presence, seeming not to do a whole lot, even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the "action" in the plot seems to affect him very little, and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic.normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters, however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused, and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion...at this point i wept...i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to, the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful, although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl. the acting was poor all round, the script and story was weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were but bluntly not all that visual. to summarise there are films which are good, films that are bad, films that are so bad they are good, films that are terrible...and then on a whole new level is "mcbain"

okay, 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus' calibre.mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous, over the top action films i've ever seen, without the nasty edge of the exterminator. other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos, but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia? all the extras are filipino. in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente'! oh yes, we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader. there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism.

a far as b-movies go, scarecrow is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. this scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.

wow, what can i say about this film? it's a lousy piece of crap. i'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did. what's wrong with this film? here's a better question: what's not wrong with this film.the story itself is just crap and cliché. here's pretty much what it's about...some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on, gets killed, and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge. "all" of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film. if you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it. also, the second one isn't much better, so don't bother watching that either...i rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrow's outfit, not because there was anything good about the movie. i think you get the picture.

if i could say it was better than gymkata, i at least felt my money was not totally wasted.then i saw steven segal's on deadly ground.this movie should see a resurrection though on mst 3k. if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo's head explode, one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause.there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career.the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say "bitch slap me! i was a writer on gymkata."

america needs the best man possible to win "the game" so who do they hire? a gymnast (oh brother!) played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas, a village of crazies and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas "to keep his hardware in his pants." (his exact words) i missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular intervals. the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass. kurt thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as "the best man for the job" as to the acting talent of kurt thomas, well if you can't say something nice... in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid. only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here. for 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen. not to say i didn't find this unwatchable, i was laughing so hard i almost choked to death. twice. only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made. although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy, he can't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground. this is the wimpiest action movie ever made, and one of the most hilarious also.* out of 4-(bad)

buck's role as the kahn brings to mind bob barker (of the price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. but there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey. kurt thomas as the baby-faced "hero" displays some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever. there's a few spooky moments (in the village of crazies, mostly), and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. but any given "ninja" movie will give you much more entertainment, and you won't feel as guilty about laughing.

whew. what can be said about gymkata that hasn't already? this is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end. if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. from cabot's wild-style mullet/sweater combo to parmistan (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this film reeks of crap.directed by robert clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lee's game of death, he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent. a few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well, from buck kartalian to tadashi yamashita, although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done.supposedly based on a book called "the terrible game," which, if i could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it, to see where this thing went wrong. instead, the book apparently is a figment of gymkata's imagination. probably something clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea.pick this one up and yakmallah it for yourself. it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen, and that is saying quite a bit.

this movie was god-awful, from conception to execution. the us needs to set up a "star wars" site in this remote country? this is their premise? the way to gain access, the us concludes, is to win an obstacle course like cross-country race, where the winner can ask anything of the leader. and who better to win this race known as the "game" than a gymnast? of course! a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. and don't forget that his father was an operative. lucky for our hero, there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots, like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square (for no reason) amidst crazy town. perfect.but above and beyond the horrible, horibble premise, is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes, the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path, and the worst climax ever. after winning the race, our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government. and lo and behold, all the effort was worth it, because the us gets its "star wars" site! huzzah! this is your triumphant ending?! wow.but still, being such a bad movie, it can be great fun to watch. the cover alone, depicting ninjas with machine guns, was enough to get me to rent this film.but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas (the gymnast-star) in real life, i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.

thank g_d it bombed, or we might get treated to such delights as "skate fu" where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but i digress. one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t & a from ms. agbayani. it's not like the world would have seen anything new (at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread.) i truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents' much better, although aubrey hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer. one explanation for kurt thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury, possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts. it's a good thing the ioc wasn't as diligent on 'doping' as they are now, or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals. to be avoided at all costs.

i'm watching this on the sci-fi channel right now. it's so horrible i can't stop watching it! i'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad. i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. some of the camera work is good. most is very questionable. there are a few decent actors in the flick. too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives. that's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! music was a little better than the acting. if you get around to watching this i hope it's because there was absolutely no other option! the sequel (yes sequel) is coming on now....i think i'll skip it! jason

this movie is hilarious. the problem is that it's not a comedy. one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel-horse in the middle of a village square (which he uses to pummel the bad guys.) another is the trek into the "village of crazies." too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce, or it may have gotten better ratings.

one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and "gymkata" happened to be on; i watched way too much of it. it is indeed hilarious, and horrifying, really. think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? not as long as this movie. it's a must-see, obviously.

gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. but not the bad kind of bad movies. this one is so awful it's fun to watch and laugh. kurt thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting. he should go back to gymnastics. but who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk, the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazies in slow motion. i don't think it was meant to be this bad, but who can tell. it's not art, but if you want something lite and fluffy that will make a good conversation, rent gymakta. makes for an evening of fun.

this is indeed quite the strange movie... first, we have an ex-u.s.-gymnast trying to turn actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he ever got (that i know of anyway) -- and for good reason. while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. second, we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie!!! i'm not kidding. this alone makes the movie extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe and third, while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast (including the required hot chick!), an actually not-so-bad story, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and overall execution of the plot are weak. this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie (too bad fox wasn't around in 1985). it's one of those movies that's simply bad, yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable.

ironically, although he can do the "splits", thomas is a complete stiff as an actor. this film is seared into my memory as one of the most side-splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen. as such, i'm actually rather fond of it. still,the only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape, and it's fun to see his tiny, muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the east european country side (including the infamous "pommel horse" shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers). but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote, and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits. thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor. everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera guys, etc. is at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. so kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think. i hope poor kurt took the money and ran. if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again, i'll bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face.

although i had seen "gymkata" in a theater way back in '85, i couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of kurt thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending.after reading some of the other reviews i picked up a copy of the newly released dvd to once again enter the world of gymkata.it turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. the film stars champion gymnast kurt thomas as jonathan cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of "parmistan" to enter and hopefully win "the game," a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like "yak power." the goal of the mission involves the star wars defense system. jonathan is trained in the martial arts by princess rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. needless to say cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of parmistan, on his way to a date with destiny, and the game.star, kurt thomas was ill served by director robert clouse, who it looks like was never on the set. the so called script is just this side of incompetent. see other reviews for the many howlers throughout. the town of crazies has a few good moments, but is ultimately ruined by bad editing. the ending...meh. still there's the germ of a good action adventure here. a hong kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good.

how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k i'll never know. "gymkata" is a ridiculous action movie, filled (or is that empty?) with paper-thin plots, dumb characters, and preposterous situations. but take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor, yet goofy, movies, you will enjoy "gymkata" a great deal.the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least i think they were government agents) to become a spy. you see his dad was another quasi-government agent, who has gone missing competing in this game, called, eloquently, "the game." so the gymnast (played blandly by kurt thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad.sounds promising doesn't it? okay, so it doesn't but still, that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie. they can be found in the movie's strange details. like the gymnast's mysterious asian girlfriend, who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie, then all of a sudden begins to talk, and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time! or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break "the game"'s non-existent rules whenever he so pleases. and of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the "village of the crazies" (evidently that's the place's real name!). nice place to visit, but i wouldn't want to live there.but where this movie really shines is the action scenes. since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities, so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses. it has to be seen to be believed.one interesting thing of note. a lot, i'd say about half the cast, dies from being shot with an arrow. interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie. if these were indeed effects, my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds. more likely, this was the film's way of not paying extras. nevertheless, "gymkata" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.

i really don't get all the adulation that this film has received. it's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. that, i suppose, in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for russell crowe's performance? the man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowe's performance is little short of caricature. it is also rather offensive. and, dare i say, just on the right side of being truly terrible

first off, the movie was not true to facts at all. i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. in my opinion russell crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. at this level abm was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. personally i think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we "lesser mortals". 5/10

i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely. having, unfortunately, dealt with lucas at such a young age, howard is now caught up in so many of lucas' traits. how else do you explain his rampage of disasters? his only useful film, of course, has been 'willow'. everything else, including this, is too reliant on superficial junk.some spoilers.he can't even have semi-intelligent focus like peter weir. no, poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten. here we have the old adage: "love conquers all, even disease." too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill. heck, even disney did better than this. ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities.howard's commentary track is just awful. don't even rent the dvd.final analysis = = cinematic dud

i've gotta say, i usually like horror movies that i've never seen... however, this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste. i'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types... but this particular movie was lame. the acting was horrible (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). and the sequel to it, scarecrow slayer was even worse! yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out, movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish. if you want a movie to just pass the time, pick this one! the special effects are cheesy as heck. but seeing that it was a low budget movie, i can kind of see where that would come in. this will kind of remind you of the movie "children of the corn." independent movies rock.... most of the time. so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these movies would be for you.

i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. i sure didn't. it's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars: music throughout the film in almost every single frame, almost no profanity, set in a time long gone, sepia-toned imagery, pretentious title, no sex, and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx/cgi so that we (the stupid audience) get it. one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong! instead they call the nobel-price (named after an actual person called alfred nobel) 'the noble-price'.. jesus! how can one make such a mistake in such a big production, supposedly based on a true story. what a sham! what were you and the others thinking ron?

... and in *no way* as clean, logical, and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches.i'm 27, and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. like the main character in the film, i was successful mainly because of logic : because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality, and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. in the end, i was really successful because of medication, by the way, but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.so, i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. a schizophrenic *isn't* a "normal man with a disease", it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him, things like time, space, and people's personalities aren't solid things. he feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. to cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which "normal" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous "cure", tear-jerking movie. it should be violently frightening. people other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in lynch's "eraserhead", for example. there should be *really* impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. it's not about *details*.i mean, watch "naked lunch", "lost highway", read p.k. dick's "martian time-split" or "ubik", do watch "the cell", "perfect blue", "dark city", or play "american mcgee's alice" on pc, and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. don't watch the "feel good" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. "the cell" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.once again, schizophrenia isn't about details, it's not a neat, tame trick played to you. it jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. believe me, this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama

when many people say it's the "worst movie i've ever seen", they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like. however, of the nearly 700 movies i can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that i walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. this is my first movie review, by the way, and i registered with imdb just to rave at this movie's badness. i went to see it when it was in the theaters (myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there), and after 15 years i can't remember very many specifics, but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear.---spoiler alert---oh my, where to begin. fat loser left at altar, goes on ski weekend, meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him, takes him home to meet the family, they're all cannibals and he's the main course, pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. puke. firstly, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny, and that this was a comedy. the special effects, what few there are, look like they were done 15 years earlier. the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch (he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn, that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them). i'm sure that there's much, much more, but i have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher.

so let me start off by saying that i saw this movie as part of a bargain. i was really bored one fine 1997 day and so i biked over to the movie rental store. i asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was. without hesitation he walked me over to "lucky stiff." he told me that he'd waive the $1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if i promised to watch the whole movie. so watch it i did, for free...this movie is terrible. god-awful even. i don't need to go into plot details, read the other reviews. the jokes make no sense. the acting was terrible. i know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. you might try to watch it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it isn't even funny in that way. avoid!

portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde; she likes him too, but not for the reasons you might think. little-seen black comedy from writer pat proft features very good performances by joe alaskey and donna dixon, yet it makes no lasting impact. it's just a quickie throwaway effort, helmed by norman bates himself, anthony perkins. even on the level of b-comedies, the somewhat-similar "eating raoul" is a better bet. there's definitely an amusing set-up here; unfortunately, the picture has nowhere to go in its second act. an interesting try, but it misfires.** from ****

a strange mix of traditional-80s, smartassy, chevy chase-type, "every-ten-lines-you-get-a-funny-one" farce and sickie black comedy. mildly amusing in spots, but utterly tasteless. there is a skiing sequence that includes the fakest-looking back-projections since "on her majesty's secret service". (**)

this is a bad, bad movie. i'm an actual fencer: trust me when i say that this film's pretension of accuracy is just that. this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80's pop. the ending is predictable, and the movie is a bore from start to finish. horrible.

yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie. for some of the names in the cast, i'd expect a much better movie. i'm almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f. murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. i hope the money was worth it. and the students, they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster. i mean, i've fenced, it's a fun sport, but i've never been that intense. the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back.

once upon a time in the mid 1990s i used to write for doctor who fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new american produced doctor who tvm . as soon as it was announced that the doctor`s arch enemy the master was going to be played by eric roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed " who is eric roberts ? " . i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham , the film was called by the sword and was about a fencing school . actually looking back now roberts is best known for the pope of greenwich village and runaway train but that didn`t stop the person putting the boot into both roberts and by the sword and his mind was made up that this american master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . strangely most fans were furious about roberts playing the master but after they saw the doctor who tvm a great many fans ( myself among them ) thought roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing american production yeah i`m digressing but by the sword was a film that i wanted to see simply because it was the first time i`d heard the name of eric roberts but i didn`t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and i was fairly disappointed with it . i know nothing about fencing ( everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . i don`t fence ) so i don`t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn`t have worked a lot better if it`d had been produced by jerry bruckheimer in the mid 1980s . you could argue this would have meant the relationship between max suba and alexander villard being off centre for most of the film but i wasn`t convinced about their love/hate relationship and abraham and roberts have given much better performances before and since by the sword

why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers? that point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie.i think sports movies fall into two categories; well made movies about the human spirit and competitions, and `by the sword'.honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be, a touching drama for trying to be your best in life, an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick. in the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it.for the record i also am a fencing instructor (and now i am officially as bad as the rest). but putting bad fencing in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically. i mean look at star wars (episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fencing). i liked those movies. but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort.don't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing. this is just a bad movie. in the end, this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells.when i see a movie and am forced to think, `man, i wish i was watching the mighty ducks.' i know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back.

let's face it; some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow. das no gonna happen neva! omfg this stupid loser kid who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom. right as he dies, he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow. the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it. we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow. they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with "takes one to know one, loser!" the scarecrow flips off the building, calls him "daddy-o", and then beheads the poor man. we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that. he goes on to kill many people, afterward. he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people, just for some laughs. no laughing here. he adds a punchline to every kill, too. every time he killed someone, he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines. in the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say "here, have an ear of corn!" then shove it up their ass. or we can actually take an example from the movie! he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him. her father, the sheriff, yelled to the madman to stop, and he said "hey, stay awhile!" and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree. in the end of the movie, he killed two guys and threw in the punchline "gotta split!" and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads. wowzors, this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad. maybe next time this guy makes a movie, it won't be gay.

i wouldn't say this is a *bad* movie. unfortunately for me, i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. i've been fencing since i was 14 years old, and this movie portrays it very poorly. f. murray abraham is good (and appears to have some fencing background), but most of the other actors--especially the students--just seem to be lost.

this is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. that is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, i suppose to maintain audience interest. what a waste of f. murray abraham's talents. you're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like zorro, scaramouche, anything that has basil rathbone as the villain. as a fencer myself i recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.

"smokey and the bandit" wasn't exactly shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it to be. it was lowdown slapstick, but it did have brains. it had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. people came out of the theater smiling. "hooper" provides none of this. there is no reason to smile. if it's supposed to be a tribute to the hollywood stuntman, it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly-choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car-jumps i've ever seen. it all looks phony, badly-filmed almost on purpose. poor sally field (as the girlfriend who wrings her hands on the sidelines) is given her weakest role, with not a single funny or smart line ("if you do that jump, i won't be here when you get back"). burt reynolds keeps looking at the camera and winking, but the joke is on any audience who sits through "hooper". * from ****

hooper is not funny, not fasted paced, not romantic and non informative. there is no real drama. you would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama, there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. no character study, no lessons learned, it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally. prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie. smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper. this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time

first off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "this entire movie had to have been a dare. you know, like, 'dude, i bet you couldn't make the worst movie ever'". with this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title. the effects are, of course, poor. the plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made. the actors, i'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school. it makes no sense. the scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable. (spoiler: at the end, when they chant lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief they were on their last scene, and at the cheesy dialogue.)

perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see. i'll start with the bad points of t he movie, which pretty much covers the entire film. first of all, something no one can avoid: terrible acting. i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked. secondly, bad/unconvincing character work/development. you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here. all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another. the scarecrow's character was overdone, and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead. next: bad dialog: the scarecrow was full of horrid one-liners that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible. lines like "let's go find some small animals to torture!" really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised. last but not least: next off: bad casting. how old was the guy who played lester? like 30? the back of his head was balding for god's sake. there is much more i could say about this film, like it's cheap special effects, it's "high school film class" effort, but the point is understood. it's just bad film making at it's worst. as for what i found to be "good" in the movie: -entertaining for those with low, low, low standards -would help put insomniacs to sleep. -a very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.

wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it. trust me watch it!i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny! i cant believe they superimposed the school sign! i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time. if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it. heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well. all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first. its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out, just not like this one.

i saw this not too long ago, and i must say: this movie is terrible. i watch crappy movies for fun. scarecreow is not fun. scarecrow is stupid. you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings. "everyone picks on me. the only girl that thinks i'm not trailer-trash likes one of the guys that pick on me. i want to kill everybody. wah." ok, i'm exaggerating. but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies.adding to what i just said, the kid's mom is promiscuous, he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on, mom's boyfriend tells him to leave, kid refuses, insisting that he isn't going to leave his own house. boyfriend chases kid into corn field. he kills kid right in front of mom, mom screams in terror, boyfriend is like, "omg! i didn't mean to!" then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it. kid was killed under a scarecrow, though. so, like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow, he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance. his victims "haven't been stalked like this before..." (scarecrow's official tag line)to make matters worse, this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days. that's right, 8 days. i was going to give this movie a 2, because in spite of itself, it has one or two redeeming moments. (they're spoilers, so i won't spoil it for you, if you actually want to see this crap.) i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting, the horrible special effects, the abysmal script, and the bad camera work, but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level.this movie isn't nearly as good as i'm making it out to be. if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you enjoy watching bad movies, like i do, then watch this at your own risk. everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times.

holy @#%& this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen. i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv, and thats saying something. i once witnessed a cow crap in a field. i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half, who knows... it might have moved or something. well that was time better spent than watching this tripe. the acting was non-existent, the plot was somewhere other than on this film. i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er. please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs. it's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. bah... i can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone. let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack, walk to your car, start the engine, then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones vibrate anymore. be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway. you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.by the way, i watched this after a "buddy" of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it. he dint come over, she had too. whats worse is that she had to watch this $%&@ thing twice! i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month. i hope it was because of this film.

this movie is so aggrivating. the main character looks like he's 35 and i've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy. the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor.also some of the worst dialogue i've heard in 3 years, "lets go find a small animal to torture".ugh.....i can't even continue, don't watch this pile of garbage, it was made in 8 days.the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures.2 out of 10, unwatchable

scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick (tim young) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike. the poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers. unfortunately he doesn't find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid. however something magical happens (no, the film doesn't suddenly become good), lester's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell...co-written, co-produced & directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr. duforq although i don't remember any character of this name, i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible. the script by itier, bill cunningham & jason white uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. we've seen it all before, we've seen killer scarecrows before, we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before, we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before, we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town sheriff's make matters even worse before. the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? the answer is a resounding no to be honest. the film has terrible character's, awful dialogue, an inconsistent & predictable story, it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame. the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't that exciting & the kills are forgettable. you know i'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn...director itier doesn't do a particularly good job here, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. also i'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix (1999) or some japanese kung-fu flick! to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit. don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? i know he's a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! there's no nudity & the gore isn't anything to write home about, there's a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in people's heads, someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.with a supposed budget of about $250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days, well at least they didn't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development. technically this is pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing... the acting sucks, the guy who played lester's mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & don't get me started on his accent...scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable & very cheesy. if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows (1988). not to be confused with the gene hackman & al pacino film scarecrow (1973) or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow (2008) which is currently in production. scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, scarecrow slayer (2003) & scarecrow gone wild (2004).

the director states in the behind-the-scenes feature that he loves horror movies. he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento, as well as other notable directors such as george a. romero and tobe hooper. basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for mother's day. the first thing they did wrong was the casting. cast people that can act. also, don't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood, 18 year old recluse. that's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing. or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, "oh..my.. god?" the scarecrow himself is quite a character. doing flips off cars and calling people losers.the movie does have one redeeming factor... oh wait, no it doesn't.if you absolutely must see this movie, than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd. it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude.

with all the excessive violence in this film, it could've been nc-17. but the gore could've been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend. there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch, then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this. almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off, but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "hoodlum" (though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, i know hoods and am part hood, they don't draw in class, they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher). the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters, but was just stabbed in the back. there were two suspenseful scenes in the film, but didn't last long enough to be scary at all. as i said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off. if the gore was actually fun to see, then it would've been nc-17. two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields, they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was, they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines. his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach, though i would've liked to see that. the acting was pathetic, characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts. i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes, i wont see it again anytime soon, but i enjoyed the excessive violence. also, don't bother with the sequel, i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death, it sounds good but isn't. the original scarecrow actually kept me interested.

spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone.this movie really annoyed me. it has a great looking monster, has some good low budget effects, some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad. half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd.the problems with this movie are many. first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school. you don't believe anything from the get go as a result. the scarecrow, while looking great isn't much beyond that. he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary. is this a comedy or a horror movie? its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up. it seems more send up of every cliché than heartfelt horror film. i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it.despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid. even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks, you're paying too much.avoid.

nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had, if you can imagine that. there is no decipherable plot or story, the special effects are a joke, and even the sound is terrible. this film was directed by henry sala. it was the only film that he ever directed, and the reason is obvious.

oh dear lord. this movie... it was horrible. i am a huge fan of horror movies. and most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, i like. the actor who played 'scarecrow' was amazing, i will say that. but this plot was awful. it made no sense! it had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. i do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who. in conclusion, this movie made me sick. if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.

this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie. the main character was decently done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory. however, everything else sucks. the director, emmanuel, is quite incompetent at film-making. he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever.- a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film. i don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn't. it was stupid. random shots of the trailer the main character lived in, random buildings, random pan shots of buildings, random cat which walks away. wtf? and clouds. lots of gloomy dark clouds.- he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot. ex: guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him. instead of just one shot, he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really edgy! and hip! and smart! stupid.the acting is horrible but it's what makes the movie so funny. and the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time. and some of the deaths could have been better. you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope. a simple corncob in the ear . the love interest was hot. voluptuous. which is why this movie gets a 2.

i desperately want to give this movie a 10...i really do. some movies, especially horror movies are so budget that they are good. a wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry...definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system. the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy...ninja... puberty-stricken... pre-thirty year old student...non-cowboy drawing...wise-cracking...son-of-a-bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year. all i can really say is, 'can you dig it' and recommend watching movies such as frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror.(what the hell were they smoking!?'

this movie could be used in film classes in a "how not to script a b-movie" course. there are inherent constrictions in a b-movie: budgets are tight, time is precious (scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but i'll just mention one: the gravedigger. the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. he is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. why give the gravedigger a daughter? why give the daughter a boyfriend? why introduce them so late in the movie? why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? scarecrow doesn't seem to care.the "story" of scarecrow goes something like this: lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who'd i'd peg to be in his early 30's) who is picked on by the other kids. he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy. his mom is a lush and the town whore. one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings (by calling him a "faggot" for drawing birds instead of "monsters and cowboys." if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys i'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows) and later, kills lester, in a cornfield, under the titular scarecrow. magically, lester's soul goes into the scarecrow. somehow, this transference changes lester's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast (i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung-fu scarecrow. i disagree. the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie). the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him, those who smoke pot in the corn field, those who dig graves, boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers, pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned. the director (a frenchman) does an impromptu version of rap music, admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by (and i'm paraphrasing): "life ez a bitch, but et has a great ass"number of beers i drank while watching this movie: 5 did it help: no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie: whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level.

amazing. that's what you'd say if you sat through this film. simply, incredibly, amazing. it's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing. that, my friends, is what is truly scary about this film. somebody thought it was a good idea to make it. well, here's another amazingly original story: high school student (occasionally seemed like collegego figure) has whore for a mom, lives in a trailer park, and is an "artist" who is ridiculed for his "being all different." well, of course, this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and, here's the original part, his soul inhabits a scarecrow (beneath which, he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john). then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him. awww.here's the breakdown:the good:--amazingly funny movieeven if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.--this and the sequel on one disk in the wal-mart $5.00 binso it's only a little overpriced.didn't hurt it, didn't help:--the violence and gore are kind of sub-standard. one person is stabbed with a corncob.--sounds like they put some effort into the musicbut it doesn't really fit the movieand isn't all that good.the bad:--terrible, terrible acting.--another slasher let-down with sexy womennone of them removing clothing. when did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??--ridiculous story.--the scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make freddy krueger and arnold swartzenegger blush.--standard underlying love story goes nowhere, and is poorly done.--some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomyou never really know who anybody is and then they're killed. and you only assume that they must've had it coming.the ugly:--extremely average slasher fare, just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well, all that other crap.--nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger, jason voorhees, pinhead, chucky, or even angela from the "sleepaway camp" seriesall of which are better than this atrocity.--the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life. the script is laden with a level of retardedness that i never imagined could exist. i'm serious hereit's a full step beyond terrible. don't get me wrong, though, it's funny as hellbut i've never heard more asinine bantereven in "slumber party massacre iii." this film makes "jason x" look like shakespeare.--the man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow: worst wig ever. dialogue to match.memorable scene:--the one where elementary-school youths spew out their own witty dialogue: "hey, let's go find small animals to torture. huh huh."acting: 3/10 story: 3/10 atmosphere: 2/10 cinematography: 1/10 character development: 2/10 special effects/make-up: 5/10 nudity/sexuality: 1/10 (no nudity, mom's a whore, girls wear no bras) violence/gore: 5/10 (low quality, mediocre amount) dialogue: 0/10 (extremely ridiculous, blatant, over-the-top and painfully funnyso bad it's good. my first rating for dialogue in any film!) music: 5/10 direction: 2/10cheesiness: 10/10 crappiness: 9/10overall: 3/10another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap. or slasher-film completists. this is not a good movie, at all. laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring.www.residenthazard.com

well, what was fun... except for the fun part.it's my second least favorite so far, i even thought it was worse than 'lazarus' and 'ghost in the machine'.let's start with the good. the teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. being the great animal lover that i am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.but then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. there were about one or two quotable lines. and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. in the end... what's the point? they all pretty much died. we didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad... just very frustrating.* star. shame because season 2 was doing so well.

the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china. the movie is based on the novel by pearl s. buck. the story is great, but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles. walter connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. he has such a heavy american accent, as do most of the lead actors, that i could not bear listening to him speak.it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles. to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african-americans.

well i'm probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site, but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i've seen in a long time. we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. yeah ok. with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again. well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it. you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. however, the film then continues on for a whole other hour. and in this remaining time, its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers. oh yea and the age old, money is the root of all evil blah blah blah. just because you know your making an epic film doesn't mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to. also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman, and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film. oh wait and the film isn't the only thing thats poorly written, the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense. she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda. then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. even if they are starving at the time of this idea, it still doesn't make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again. there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to. the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography. the land is shot beautifully, oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive. too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say. one last thing. i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything. for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability, but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul, they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface(also a better film than this). of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian, the rest are just americans being silly. oh and please ms. rainer that was a really nice one note performance, not, if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands, oh i would. the good earth is one epic waste of time. if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath, a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets. mainly because it wasn't written by a monkey.

luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth. unfortunately, her role required no. she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). set in ancient asia, both actors were not asian, but were very convincing in their roles. i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance, because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for. she must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. this seems like something that hollywood does often. al pacino has played an italian and cuban. i felt luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. she stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. if her brilliant acting was so subtle, i suppose i did not see it.

a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china. wang lung (paul muni) buys o-lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (luis rainer). american stars appear in the leading roles, talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. a good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. they are seen as property and investment. because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. luise rainer won an academy award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. o-lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again. another problem with the movie is the ending. it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture. this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions.

absolute garbage, worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc.truly dire acting, not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures.watch it just for how truly bad this film is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s.if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector, those are proper martial arts films.have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is.

wow, i knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. spoilerific comments ensue.roddy roddy piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!), helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. his adopted son returns from armed forces "special ops" and because he's "seen things" - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son.oh, the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-army bloke. this happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene.the action could have saved this film, but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. it's all been done before, it's all been done much much better (ong-bak is a prime example). this is the worst film i've ever seen - and i've seen waterworld, twice.erm, the film is called honor (spelt wrong for the americans) and the tag line has "from the makers of bloodsport and kickboxer" - check out director david worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there, even though they are over 10 years old. such classics as "shark attack 3: megalodon" - says it all really.i'll give you £10 if you don't go to see this film.ps - apologise for not know character names, tells you something though.

there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie. the girlfriend and i both love action films. especially fight scenes (bloodsport and kickboxer was awesome), but this movie was not entertaining. five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and "angry" facial expressions. the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times. the army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique. the music isn't good either. they fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, 'cause these guys are thugs. the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas.everything about this movie is classic b-style. the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood alleyway. the film is called "honor," but there was no honor in making this film. it was simply a waste of money, and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorable.go see felon instead. the fight scenes and situations are more real.

this film has the look and feel of a student film project. yeah, there are some interesting (albeit gimmicky) edits and shots, but the end result was juvenile.the director didn't seem to be saying "look at this film." it seemed as if he were saying, "look at me! i'm a director!"thumbs down.

this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews. the limey is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful nightwatch with ewan macgregor and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti-talented jennifer lopez. terence stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story, filming and just plain common sense. this film does everything wrong. what were they thinking?

the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine. the article made this film look interesting. well, it isn't. this was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. all the actors in this movie are awful, except faye dunaway, who is always a joy to watch. but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio. marzio has such a thick argentinean accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says. also on hand is nicholas pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest to gina phillips. the bottom line: this movie is not scary. there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. i would have given this one star, but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much. but even she wasn't that great in this.

for some reason, tv guide gave this two and a half stars, plus faye dunaway is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. my, oh, my, this may be the worst film i've ever seen. ever. from its horrid acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, i shouted to the tv "i can't act!" when she asks what he needs, i yell "i need acting lessons!" to the unbelievably bad dialog ("give me back my organs!").and the brian depalma wannabe ending, too, it was all just beyond awful. i wanted to like it. dunaway is one of the best actors ever. and the production values were pretty good.but wowzers, this had me laughing, laughing!, most of the time.don't even bother out of curiosity, that was my first mistake. staying with it was definitely my second, and third and fourth.

...cause they're both pretty lousy. i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs. she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture, rip someone to bloody pieces, and calmly re-enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened. now, you know a movie's in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention.i admit, i paid $30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie. i know what you're thinking--30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole. and you would be absolutely correct. this movie sucks. there, it's right out in the open. i was expecting some actual scares, and i waited and waited and waited. none came. the raven (probably a crow in makeup) didn't scare me, seeing small pieces of internal organs didn't scare me, and even faye didn't scare me. i'm not that brave, i know, so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble. what's more, jennifer wasn't scared either. her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything. her life was rapidly coming to a close and she's worried about attaining more money. honey, you can't take money where you're going!!! "i need money," she continually says, completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function.meanwhile, i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother (faye). i was suspicious at first, faye playing a grandmother and all, and i was still suspicious at the end. there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother-from-hell are forced to share temporarily, and i'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother. here's the weird part--the relative looks like she's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party. mary ellen looks like she's just gotten a face-lift from a renowned surgeon. face-lifts can't work miracles, but i think faye's appearance is important to the rice-paper plot. spoiler!!! it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting...sorry, my little joke. seriously though, there's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate. yuck, huh? interestingly enough, mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact. how did she avoid the family curse? something's up with her, obviously.another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars--this movie features one of my all-time movie pet peeves. i refer to the double ending. this movie ends twice. i absolutely hate it when that happens, and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending, didn't like it, and forget to remove it during editing. i guess it's supposed to be scary, but it is only if you're a film editor.there is one perk to this debacle, though, and it's one of the reasons i bought the dvd. the "filmmaker" commentary features faye dunaway, and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn't have lines to recite. guess what--the movie sucked so bad i wasn't able to sit through it again. drat.

don't bother. a little prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from dunaway. the plot is one of those bumper car episodes... the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again, until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot. gina phillips is actually good, but it's hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx's brother's duck soup. ah, the raven...now there's an actor. and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. or dr. dread who's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies. i'm one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end. quoth the raven, "nevermore."

oh this was a really bad movie. the girl who plays jennifer is ok, but i think she acts bitchy through the movie, not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night, but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap. faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly. i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe, i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work(ravens, house of usher-like family curse,and being buried alive)-still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film.

this movie was a littttle confusing at first. i usually like gina phillips, but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the rosie, that one also not one her good movies. jeepers creepers was way better. anyway, faye dunaway was good. she totally creeped me out and at the end, that was crazy. it was about jennifer cassi(phillips) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. she stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(dunaway) lives at with an aunt named emma. mary ellen(dunaway) is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can't die. even if jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries. ravens have a weird part in it. when the relations go to sleep, the ravens eat there organs, so they can't go to sleep. but they do. basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die and her relations will be buried, but not dead, b/c they have to suffer forever so mary ellen can stay alive. yeah, i hope this helps. if it doesn't, sorry. love ya.

jennifer's shadow is set in argentina & starts as jennifer cassi (gina philips) arrives there after her sister johanna dies. jennifer is left johanna's large house in her will, jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen (faye dunaway) is opposed to the sale. however strange things begin to happen, jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill. after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared, what is happening to jennifer? is it an ancient family curse? will jennifer be the next to succumb to it...this argentinian american co-production was co-written & co-directed by daniel de la vega & pablo parés & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them. the script by vega, parés & p.j. pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants, i mean i'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls. the character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? how did he know about the demons? what is his interest & motivation for getting involved? i couldn't see it. jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady, her grandmother mary allen is as clichéd as they come & it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain. i mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine. there are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist i didn't like jennifer's shadow one iota.directors vega & parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white, i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it's been done so many times before & often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless. there's a definite 40's period look as well, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted & cheap looking. jennifer's shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable. if that wasn't enough there's no gore either, there's a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else.with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 & retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it's us & international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days & jennifer's shadow pretty much proves that theory. there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well, even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying. the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money.jennifer's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish, i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies!!? (1964) again instead. a total waste of time.

jennifer cassi (gina philips from "dead and breakfast") returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (fay dunaway) who's still living in it. jennifer decides to sell it as she's in dire need of the money much to granny's chagrin. she also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. there was really no one to relate to in this film. jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental, and narcissistic, whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful, sad, and also narcissistic. the film is good and well-made, but with no one to empathize with i found it hard to care about what happened to them.my grade: c-

this is easily the most disappointing, least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre, which, by the way, are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home. rather than being "exploitation" or demeaning, these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era. well, not bucktown.in this story, duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother. he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force, bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses. duke resists, and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police. unfortunately, he does so by calling in a posse of his friends (these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with duke on "jobs" in the past) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood. and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it. ignorance is not a justification for murder, and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street. while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre, it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family, cuss them out, give them a jujitsu ass-kickin' and set their 'fro on fire. that has art (and a reason for existing) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back. of course, in this bizarre tale, she is playing a woman completely under the man's thumb, afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people. indeed, her advice to duke is, "run, man, they gonna kill you!"following the sickening and gratuitous violence, we are expected to believe that the town's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends, congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor, as opposed to, say, calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody. duke's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree. they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors (to quote the mayor, "they are ten times worse than what we had before!"). now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt, protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets. unfortunately, duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero, as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force. i wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point. i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons, but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence, duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police. duke is a pig.finally, when everyone in town but duke, aretha, and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin' in the street, our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they don't. duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice. if you are interested in this genre of film, by all means, i highly recommend them, see coffy, foxy brown, truck turner, blacula, sheba babybut if in the process you should run across this dvd, throw it as far away as you possibly can! drop it like it's hot! it should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste! there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining, satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime, obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores.

this movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny.the underlying message i got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man. every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is being lazy, being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men.but, it is a comedy, and a piece of art, so it is simply someones point of view. even if i don't agree with it, they are still entitled to it.an amusing film, but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid. best film ever my foot.

with a movie called "gayniggers from outer space" how could you go wrong? just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the village people as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. plot is unimportant. too bad, this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot. the characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails.the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film. my expectation were to high apparently.

well, what can i say about this movie. i'm speechless. i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that really pi*sed me off was the music. and to top it all off someone commented on how much they liked it. to them all i have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time fistsof fury starring bruce lee. if he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. i say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film.i now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it. the only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity. what is this world coming to.

this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth, in order to create a gay universe.i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was. still, i was shocked at how bad it was. it looked more like a film made 50 years ago. the acting, if any, is ultra bad. the sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making any college film look mega budget. and the special effects are laughably simple, indeed jaw dropping as others have commented, but jaw droppingly embarrassing.one has to be severely intoxicated, or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film. if i was from denmark, i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film.

it's hard to know what was going through per kristensen and morten lindberg's heads when they wrote "gayniggers from outer space" - the movie is billed as a comedy, yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names (capt. b. dick, sgt. shaved balls). the rest of the movie is a (presumably) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-overs (with the 'actors' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling), 'futuristic' computer displays filled with spelling mistakes, and a plot that makes almost no sense.even though 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good film is. it may be entertaining to watch with some friends, but this film only deserves about a '2' out of ten...slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie.

gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth. being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. hence, when they discover women or "female creatures" live on earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.an offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. however, there's little substance underneath. as another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. arminass); i think i laughed once at one small gay joke. i think i got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that i had had enough; i kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!). not brilliant or particularly well-written.

i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. but, no, that's really what it was. and since the film was only about 27 minutes long, i decided to give it a try. if it had turned out to be some porno movie, i would have stopped watching. instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen. the danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a star trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the earth! and in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.subtle, this ain't. with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i've ever heard, i don't even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed! however, despite the utter crappiness of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. but, as i mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. by the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to who would make this, why make it and who was the intended audience?! it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!

gayniggers from outer space is pretty much summed up by its name. running only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to earth to free the men from women. while i see a little significance to the plot, it also is really illogical. granted, its meant to be a comedy/spoof on society and science fiction. i found myself laughing several times, so it succeeds there.the special effects are horrible. when the spaceship is floating above the earth, you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason. the asteroids shown in the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are messed up; in general, the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously. if you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, its very accessible and easy to see through to the end. some parts are hilarious. but overall, the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever.seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects, its not the worst thing to see. but its illogical and holds little long-term value. i can't really recommend it; if you do watch it, do so for the unique concept, not the quality.

i really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. the acting was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, sooo slowwwwww. the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end. twenty minuets into a films and i'm praying for an ending. sure some of the visuals were nice, but c'mon guys, i mean really! and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of. the music there was was annoying, and boring. there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too, those were also annoying. mainly this film managed to bore me, and creep me out at the same time.i'm glad its over. i need to go see "tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.

when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. i'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage. however, the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed. although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent. the visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece. however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered over the head with. most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. it seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. the voice overs from felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing (and even that wasn't properly addressed). i'm afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a 'reasonable first attempt', by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading dh lawrence. not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all.

the brothers quay are directors, judging by conventional thought, should have stuck to making short films. i myself actually really liked their first feature, institute benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore effort, the piano tuner of earthquakes, i'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length. piano tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous film to look at, and often to listen to. unfortunately, it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace. reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life. one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. my god, it's awful here. a huge bust.

i still can't believe this movie. they got so much unbelievable things in it, that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it.the story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story at all. how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, town conspiracies, sex-jokes and a fbi-agent? you can't.beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors. i watched this film and thought: 'is this really marlon brando? no, it can't be. (5 minutes later) is this charlie sheen? wow, maybe brando is true. (5 minutes later) this can't be donald sutherland. (5 minutes later) no, not mira sorvino. this movie is too bad for all of them. (at the end). no, no, no, this can't absolutely not be martin sheen!!! not for 10 seconds of such a movie.' then it was over and i down with my nerves. so many good, oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, dumb, awful movie. i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one. they couldn't got so much money.only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie.3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)

it's a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i'd hate to think of him going out on free money. not what his fans ought to remember him by.brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for financing of his own work. brando is the warden of a local prison which in america, when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area. that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout. unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges, his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters. even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers, charlie sheen and thomas haden church, their hearts still belong to daddy.not to fear because brando's willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have. what to do, but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the treasury. although free money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved. some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight arrow fbi agent.of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century. were it not for brando's presence and were it some 40 years earlier, free money would be playing the drive-in circuit in red state america where the populace could see how they're being satirized.or a feeble attempt is made to satirize them.

....ripoff of a dozen better films. particularly steven martin's "la story", which at least had the grace to be obviously fictional even though it starred his then-girlfriend playing his girlfriend in the film.yes, naive boys and girls, "20 dates" is a mockumentary, although i am not absolutely certain that was myles berkowitz's intent when he started. my impression is that he started the project semi-seriously, then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous. as a result, the whole thing has an uneasy, cheap and insincere feeling about it.as someone smartly pointed out, the film has two of the "dates" suing and putting restraining orders on myles and yet they appear in the film, which would be impossible as it would require a consent form. it also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as "the dates" are professional actresses (albiet not famous ones, excepting tina carrere) -- they are simply too obviously pretty, polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians.mr. berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress, instead of utilizing a variety of believable women, which might have made the premise (even in a mockumentary) more believable and funnier. he also skates over what is probably his real-world problem, and which is that both the movie character and the real world myles berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed (his real life imdb credits are practically non-existent, excepting this film). even in the world of the movie, his ex-wife divorced him for never being employed. i think the viewer (let alone mr. berkowitz's real life dates) are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the us, in a luxury apartment, driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he doesn't seen to have any source of income whatsoever. (is he drug dealer? living off his rich parents? no clue!)you can get away with most anything in a film, if the jokes are really funny. "20 dates" is painfully, embarrassingly un-funny. mr. berkowitz's idea of a joke is to have his character, while on restaurant dates, announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation -- the worst kind of childish potty humor.it is not very surprising to discover that mr. berkowitz never made a film before "20 dates" and in the last 8 years, has not made a single film, appeared as an actor in anyone else's film or had a writing or producing credit of any kind. my gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by "elie" (the gangster money man who appears off-camera) but more likely by mr. berkowitz's affluent parents, or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards. whichever it was, we can all rest easy that we are unlikely to have to see myles berkowitz or any of his creative efforts ever again. hallelujah!!!

i went to a screening of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me laugh, it had some very major flaws. it first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real-life divorcee trying to find love in la. what it morphs into is a depressing, narcissistic, and unfunny romp through the history of the film director's love life and professional life. jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this man's dates progress. the ridiculousness is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character and then expects us to be concerned.

the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates, then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you (and even his "friends") really can't stand. it is a pretty interesting concept; film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la. the problem is that it feels incredibly (and badly) scripted at times and blatantly self-promoting. it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer/actor is so egotistical, uncool, untrue, and simply unlikeable. you end up feeling sorry for his dates.

filmed in a documentary style, but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached. a recently divorced wannabe film maker(myles berkowitz)sees a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time. he intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications. the comedy is spotty at best; the rest is mishap after mishap. also taking part are richard arlook, robert mckee and the enticing elisabeth wagner. trying for credibility the fetching tia carrere is talked into a cameo. this will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date.

while bondarchuk was by no means a young man when he was commissioned to work on this project, he was still a novice director with only a single pictures, a successful adaptation of a short wwii story, to his name. bondarchuk of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera, and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale. and it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes, often unfortunate camera positions, performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices, awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements.vidor's "war and peace" was probably the main reason that prompted the soviet government to spare no expense on this production. the ussr release of the vidor's picture made quite a splash. certainly, bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the hollywood film and find his own audrey. his final choice, lyudmila savelyeva, a big-eyed sprightly dark-haired thing indeed somewhat resembles hepburn. unfortunately she was a kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent, so unsurprisingly the most kind word that i can find to describe her performance is "awful".though it might be expected that soviet actors, speaking the same language as tolstoy's characters, would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this war and peace often proves that not to be the case. the revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of russian cultural soil, that the world of war and peace grown out of, so a good share of these big name soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as americans performing shakespeare ( i don't mean of course that american actors can't possibly play shakespeare credibly, but you'll know what i mean if you witnessed american members of the cast in branagh's adaptations). of the three main characters only bondarchuk's pierre is commendable, but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early going.

i'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake, as i was unable to watch all of it. perhaps if i'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, i might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-moving for me.i read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. this did not help the film, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events.this is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, i believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. i found part i to be enjoyable enough, but it was all i could do to sit through part ii, which drags interminably. reading tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. if you get a good translation or can read it in the original, his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. on film, however, it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous.i have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw. it's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story.clearly, i'm missing something, but i just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts iii and iv.

this is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the ruscico dvd release for north america. i don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. anyway, the sound mixing on these dvd's was absolutely horrible. the levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that i didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. when it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. occasionally, the orchestra and foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. my wife and i found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these dvd's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. and, like another user has already commented, when we selected english audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between russian and english; and occasionally when the characters spoke in french on the native track the dubbing was in russian, so you're sol if you understand neither. ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. before you fork out $50+ for this movie on dvd for your own library, i'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.

please take a minute to read my entire review. i am not knocking the film itself - only the dvd versions currently available.***i really wanted to give this film even two stars. i mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10!?!here's how: an epic film adaptation of tolstoy's novel "war and peace" with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the red army, and an extremely faithful, scene-for-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours - if that's what you were seeing.the trouble is you can't see that film - anywhere as far as i know.i am attempting to watch the ruscico dvd version - widely considered the best version available since it's letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other dvd releases. but, it is one of the worst film prints i've ever seen transfered to dvd. the picture is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. it's almost tolerable if you crank your brightness, color and picture levels up to maximum.... but the problem doesn't end there.the sound is also way inconsistent, blaringly loud in parts, virtually inaudible in others. and as for languages, it's a huge problem for english speakers - the dubbed option has some good actors, and some really terrible ones whose performance grates, and parts of the film just aren't dubbed at all, slipping back into russian and even french randomly.the subtitled option isn't much better. the subtitles don't appear below the image, but right over it - obscuring some of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the scenery. furthermore, the subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to tolstoy's actual words), and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts. so, even if you max out the color, brightness and picture settings, and turn the volume way up, and choose subtitled *and* english dubbed, you're still going to get a film that's annoying to watch and listen to.can it's content overcome that? it might have been able to, but at seven hours - who can stand it for that long?maybe someday, someone will come along and restore this - and maybe then i will see a masterpiece - but for now, i just can't give more than one star to something i've only been able to stand watching about the first 12% of.

the angry red planet (quickie review) like "the man from planet x," this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing. meaning, we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction. and yes, it's another "classic" released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by midnite movies.so, the main reason to watch this film? oh, it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars. (what, you thought "angry red planet" referred to neptune?) prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship, inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the "puny female" member of the crew. it'd be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it weren't so damn funny. but mars is the real reason we're watching this thing. the film is generally black and white, but mars, well mars is screaming bloody red. it's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness. it's really quite a sightas are the (ha ha) aliens viewers are to witness. the best being the "ratbatspidercrab." you think that's a joke? that's what they call it in the movie! it's a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing combining traits of rats, bats, spiders, and crabs. it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our "heroic crew." there are other weird, and poorly imagined, aliens to be seen, but that one takes the cake. eventually, after their harrowing experience on mars, the sexist crew boards their "ship" and returns to whatever planet it was they came from.this ain't for everyone. science fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers, and some general film buffs. fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one (if they never got to it on the show).2/10 modern score, 6/10 nostalgia score, 4/10 overall.(www.residenthazard.com)

i gave this movie a 2, and though i consider myself a science fiction fan, i found this movie very difficult to take seriously. it was on amc one late night, and i'm glad i saw it for free. this movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more.the special effects are about average for the time period - not awful, but not great, either. of course we know more about mars now than we did back then, but we really can't hold that against this film. the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the story.there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail - the astronaut's injury/condition, the city on mars, the creature in the lake, etc. overall, the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of the outer limits - complete with a cheesy ending.

hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly. you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter which makes everything very murky. the martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing. there are echoes of 'bride of the monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about, the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining. better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci-fi' music score, repeated endlessly, will drive you insane. if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time.

the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 nov 1918. the troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the french army, including the legion, marched off to war in 1914! this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (the french army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. metropolitan french troops were put into "horizon blue" and colonial troops were put into khaki.) the claude van-damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.

you can tell a lew grade production a mile off  distinctly british in style; epic in conception; peopled by international all-star casts; usually set in exotic climes. it's a formula that grade and his company itc employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s, resulting in titles like the eagle has landed, firepower, and raise the titanic! in 1977 grade produced march or die, a remarkably old-fashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above. directed by the usually dependable dick richards  who helmed the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier - march or die is an unfortunate disappointment.a company of foreign legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian general foster (gene hackman) is sent to morocco shortly after world war 1. their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated francois marneau (max von sydow). the archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of erfoud, but fear an attack from arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group. foster is not happy with the assignment  he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives. this creates ongoing tension between himself and marneau, who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible. the problems heighten when a beautiful woman named simone picard (catherine deneuve) tags along with the legionnaires. she is hoping to find out what happened to her father, a historian abducted by the arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team. her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires, none more so than gypsy thief marco segrain (terence hill), a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature. things climax with a huge battle at erfoud, with swarms of united arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives.on paper the star duo of gene hackman and terence hill seem a mismatch  hackman is the heavyweight oscar-winning character actor, hill the handsome but limited italian heart-throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns. one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen. yet, bizarrely, it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance, while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels. the film is attractively shot on desert locations, but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for. maurice jarre's music is uncommonly flat too  very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of arabia score. it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old-fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s (it was a genre that peaked in the 30s, and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades). sadly, the gamble doesn't really pay off  this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march.

bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida. where he meets a little penquin, which he tries to save from an eskimo. this short tries and the penquin is adorable, but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughs department. the eskimo isn't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly, even other shorts when he's paired with other unknown antagonists. so i can't in good conscience recommend this one. however it is nice to see it in it's uncut form. this cartoon is on disk 3 of the "looney tunes golden collection volume 1" my grade: c

this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date, the best part was christian j. meoli "leonard" attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar, kind-of like i wanted to do on the dvd, to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film. it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good, i mean with sean astin "andrew" (played his part perfectly, did a great job, too bad it was in this film), kyra sedgwick "bevan", ron livingston "chad", renée zellweger "poet" (they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie...if the cast had any dignity, they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer / director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom

this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood. bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of "deewar" and "on the waterfront" will bring home an oscar. it turned out to be rookie mistake.even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic. in the original, brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace.bollywood must move out of hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.

i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. and i have to say, it did not deserve it.parinda was so hyped, that i was really looking forward to watch it.parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film-makers, despite having a great story. it was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "on the waterfront".anil kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from america. the direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.give this script to any of them - ram gopal verma, deepa mehta, mahesh bhatt, sudhir mishra, and i'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.i'm not saying parinda was bad. it was just not good enough.

i went into this movie hoping for the best. i like wartime musicals in general. dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. the love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. i did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with "der fuhrer's face." the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. bert lahr's comedy skits were interminable.there were parts to enjoy: lucille ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.

it's curious that the two stars of meet the people were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. lucille ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. as for dick powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like meet the people and his career salvation would be coming in his next film.i think the only reason that dick powell did the film was because a young player from mgm was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time. his private time with june allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. powell looks crashingly bored and can't summon up any kind of emotion at all.he was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind he ran from warner brothers from. the original show meet the people was not a book show, it was a revue and it ran in the 1940-41 season on broadway for 160 performances. when mgm bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song. the rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. odd when you consider some of the source material is from burton lane, e.y. harburg, harold arlen, and rodgers&hart. these guys just must have emptied the trunk for material.the plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. powell is the writer of a revue called meet the people and he's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star lucille ball. she's interested, he's interested, they're both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale. that's the film in a nutshell.mgm did give powell and ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching meet the people. the big bands of vaughn monroe and spike jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is bert lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like lou costello had in the dream sequence in in the navy. the song heave ho is written by arlen and harburg who wrote for lahr, the courage number from the wizard of oz. and as just about everyone in the world has seen that film, you have an idea of heave ho is like.dick powell's next film was murder my sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals. and lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do.

max had the v-8, trace (wheels of fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland. be amazed as mad max 2 (aka the road warrior) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.why is wof set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? simple, the road warrior was! actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the road warrior! except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non-vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.in typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion. inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them. along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film. generally i waited for trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated. badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker. the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.rats: nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior. and that in and of itself is saying a lot! by this count 2020 texas gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire. a poor road warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.

i've never found charley chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of john cleese, whom i find very funny. (charley chase also reminds me of gowky hen broon from scotland's 'sunday post' comics page.) in chase's best films, i tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him. i'll give chase credit that his very best films -- such as 'mighty like a moose' and 'his wooden wedding' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but i'm positive that even the most die-hard chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'married to order' just isn't funny at all.chase -- eager, awkward, gormless, naff -- is a young swain hoping to court the fair rose. oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who disdains chase as a 'mollycoddle'. leo white, who did more notable work as a foil for chaplin at essanay, is on hand here as a rival.there's some action involving an ingersoll watch. i was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product-placement? sadly, a major flaw in 'married to order' is the casting of rosemary theby as rose: she's meant to be a standard-issue ingenue, but theby -- flat-chested, hawk-faced -- is physically wrong for the role. theby (the wife of harry myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but was never a believable ingenue. film historian william k everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books.i'll rate 'married to order' just 3 out of 10, and i'm being charitable ... because i keep suspecting that charley chase has got something that everyone else gets but i keep missing.

while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny, in this film he certainly is. it's a shame, as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy? are very good chase films, so he could be really funny given good material. unfortunately, in this film he's given absolutely nothing. even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. it's a shame, as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't.by the way, for those used to the look for charley from the mid-1920s on, you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect.

in my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from "only the brave" to "all about lane". i went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. although, i appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. the performances of marc dacascos, tamlyn tomita, and jason scott lee were all great. however, the director should have never put himself as the main character in the movie. sorry lane, you are just not a film actor. stick to what you're good at - theater acting. gina hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. she should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a miss nisei queen. there were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... why weren't they cast for that role? another major problem with this film were its action sequences. the japanese-american soldiers don't look like they were fighting german soldiers... let alone anyone. granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some actually fighting? this film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a major distribution.

i can sit through this movie once, but i doubt i could make it through a second time. mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan. the fun of matt dillon(think something about mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton. this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable. one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part. i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. go see this with your little ones, i.e. the "single digit bracket" kids and don't expect a lot from this film._x

herbie, the volkswagen that thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by maggie peyton (lindsay lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion. the only thing standing in her way is the current champion, trip murphy (matt dillon), who will do anything to stop them.the original love bug wasn't that good. even as a kid, i remember not liking it very much. i had some hope for the sequel though. i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. unfortunately, herbie is no better now than he was before. the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. it will probably entertain the kids but that's all.i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton. she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls. matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. justin long, breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.angela robinson directs and she does an okay job. she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier? these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. in the end, herbie is a safe, predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. everyone else is better off skipping it. rating 4/10

a failure. the movie was just not good. it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at. i mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. lindsey lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies. the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie, that is free.the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. these songs are so good. especially alyson and amanda's walking on sunshine and caleigh peter's, beach boy song, fun fun fun.4 out of 10. if i gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.

i went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. i insisted we go the matinée showing, not because i'm a tightwad, but just feeling i had. in the nascar spirit, this is a sponser's dream. so much blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as an info-mercial, if it weren't for the so-called acting. keeping with tradition, the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines, the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture. earlier herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. ms. lohan, disney's reigning drama queen, has little acting ability. i was surprised that mr. keaton and mr. dillon would get involved in such a project. only the snack bar, was a bigger ripoff!

there are few uplifting things to say about this, but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent, we end up with movies like this.lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take. here she can only fail.children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children (although still pretty dumb). the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. and as a family sports movie this is horrible. the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car-bash fest creating some tension. if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here. after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.

the idea of in the name of the people is good, a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. and you could expect of the actors, especially scott bakula to do some good acting, unfortunately they don't! in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker. the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say... if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking!

the plot of this movie hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. this girl was someone's daughter. i don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else's daughter. or, alternately, could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter. and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.that said, the characters were acted with conviction by the actors. i thought changing scott bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is. you couldn't see into his eyes at all.

ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying breed, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! jeez, when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud? s**t happens. if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection.boring, tedious, and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of coburn/hackman/bergen's presence. nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty. may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth. a monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70's. virtually impossible to sit through the entire film. i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky luke/trinity series. 4 horses/10-all deader'n hell.

this is a movie about animal cruelty. under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death in slow motion. the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. this is one of the sickest, slimiest movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing. as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; i'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.

here's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it. director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game; how much better his the professionals was! the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes. this film needed to be sped-up, if anything. that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments- just lazy. sloppy work. too bad. the actors did ok, but i've certainly seen all of them do better. ben johnson's always a joy, though. i first saw this flick almost 30 years ago; was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later.

gritty, dusty western from director richard brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (gene hackman), a suave gambler (james coburn), a cocky kid (jan michael vincent), and even a female (a surprisingly game candice bergen). once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from gary cooper's era). good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. everyone involved should be embarrassed. everyone. ice-t is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely awful, and hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie. the plot steals heavily from executive decision, but compared to air rage, executive decision is academy award material. i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie. air rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault never to see the light of day again. anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them. the best part of this movie probably comes from the ending, when the credits rolled. this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen. ice-t should stick to law and order, and the other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide. either way, they should never attempt to be in a movie again.

don't expect much from this film. in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in 1956,title, julie. in this film doris,who was a flight attendant,stewardess,in those days,landed the air craft after her derange husband,played by louis jordan shot the captain. she did a far better job,more convincing,than kim ojah,who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower. i know a little about 747 aircraft,i use to be a flight attendant myself. like i said,do not expect much from this film,it was done on a cheap budget. the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it. oceanic is one name that several movies have used. the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft.

i signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. besides being a rip-off of executive decision or air force one or any other kind of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. it's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid, cliché-ridden script to work with. it's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director also isn't the brightest bulb in the movie business, nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. the mostly low-rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment, because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure, not that being a part of this joke-of-a-movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition. it may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. i see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case, for, to do so, would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand. just as studying well-made movies can inspire you how to make a good, skillfully put-together work of art and beauty, the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what not to do and what does not work! be warned.

firstly, i won't tell you why i rented this movie, as i'm still confused myself...air rage is much like any movie i've seen where a plane is hijacked. there is of course that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker looking for revenge. the sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?although it's ice-t (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at acting while he's not busy putting the "c" back in front of rap) who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' overlooked by the five hijackers, which naturally comes back to haunt them. as for the rest of the cast, the only person i managed to recognize was steve hytner, more commonly known as kenny bania from "seinfeld".i can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used about a pound of plastique to blow a lock off a door... brilliant.the plot was unnaturally predictable.the script - atrocious. it got to the point where i could say something, which i felt would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie.as for special effects... the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity to run my tv and vcr for 100 minutes.and the title - the movie did take place in the air. but due to the less than stellar performances, the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer.so, if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie, just because it's bad. please save yourself, don't choose this.

words can't describe how bad this movie is. i can't explain it by writing only. you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be. not that i recommend you to do that. there are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. to start with the technical first, there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane. i won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. they didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original boeing livery. very bad. the plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. also, i was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. "executive decision" should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the "turbulence"-movies are better. in fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.

...except for jon heder. this guy tanked the entire movie.the plot sounded entertaining. a 29 year old slacker son(heder)still lives with widowed mom (keaton)who happens to meet a new love (daniels). slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. he also meets a girl(faris).i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach. heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale. at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end. in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me!

starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost.the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success.let's be honest - heder's acting was pretty poor. keaton, daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length.the ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable i've ticked the spoilers box for this one line.my advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.

oh my goodness. this was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself. jeffrey (jon heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (diane keaton) and not planning on going anywhere. until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert (jeff daniels) who she may be getting married to.it would have been an ok movie if heder didn't play his jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. in the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's because i said so. not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don't look very interested either. apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at! if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort.

i had high hopes for this movie. the theater monologue is great and nic balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies, but this movie is bad. it's completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers. the "linguistic games" were hideous and over the top. nothing about the film seemed real to me. the ending was way too deus ex machina for me.i am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life.

it's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. would be graduate has an idea. he wants total control. so he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with. usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. usually, he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. usually, he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer. when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare.

the plot is rocky. the acting is somewhere south of a jr. high school play. the cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete. i couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. think death valley days meets mayberry rfd. people running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. it has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. picture the good guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the ford mustang right in front of a hitching rail. picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a japanese sound track but with english sub-titles. it's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote. it's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. there's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, and a twanging jew's-harp in the soundtrack. really! if someone brings this to your home for a saturday night movie session, tell 'em your dvd player died.

sadly imdb does not allow me to rate judges lower than 1. what a shame. this ghastly movie is so bad that i actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending. the script had a few bright moments, but the directing, editing, acting, audio quality, and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make judges utterly unbearable.judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western, but in reality was nothing of the sort. what it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe. you can try to pretend it is okay, but it just keeps on stinking.why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me. we rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television. but judges is worse than the most pathetic scifi channel original. i intend to demand my money back from hollywood video.

i can see where the film makers were going with this. but they never really reach their destination. it's supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame." but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt. it doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts. and, failing these two points, it lacks the humor of a successful parody. in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile. a whole lotta bad movie!

avoid this crap at all costs. bad script, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound, and bad music. get the idea? this movie tries to be western flavored, it's not. it tries to be hard core violent, it's not. it tries to present a fresh look at an old genre, it doesn't. the actors try there best, and my heart goes out to them. but with such inane material to work with it's hard to make something shine. to me this has all of the looks of a "fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire" first attempt. freshmen film makers often bite off more that they, or their budget, can chew. the best thing they can do is to take a few steps back, reassess what is possible, and work within their limited budget the next time out.

ever wonder why pacific islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of black americans? regardless of their ethnic origins? well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question - but it will provide an excellent case study.from its onset this film acts as a sort of "old school" for pacific island new zealanders, which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task. is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of pacific island new zealanders? or is it intended to exploit this potential market? the story is weak, jokes humorless, and the ending is expected. this film has done nothing for new zealand cinema, as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit.

i just sat in the theater bored as hell, i wanted to leave halfway through the movie. the plot is simple 4 samoan guys wreck weddings. so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding. yawn.the thing that peeved me off the most was the so-called crude jokes... they were highly unfunny, clichéd and thrown in your face, to make you get into the already dull movie. the acting was below-average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot.all in all, one of the worse movies i've seen of 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just ugly.well thank god a friend shouted me. avoid.

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes/races. what i got was nothing. the racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are "going fast" in one scene a mercedes slr goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles. its just ridiculous.if you wanna see a real movie about cars, see the fast and the furious series. they may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be. better yet just watch mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made i think.

this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen.here is the plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you have the acting as well.beginning, bring in characters, hot woman singing (obvious lip sync). music agent or producer comes in, thinks that she is awesome asks her to race. she turns down, too many bad memories. flash to war hero, back from war, has several fights, and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone. drive off in fast exotic car. brother races, then dies. hero to avenge death, cut away to getting weapons from friend. (you have never seen this friend before or after, but seems to really care about him) are you sure you want to do this; yes; i mean are you really sure; yes, give me weapons; are you really sure; yes; ok, i guess i can't talk you out of it, be careful man, i love you.now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove. finds woman, decides to rescue her, she drives off, and he doesn't finish killing his uncle. now there will be a race to finish the movie. oh yeah, need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter, but maybe it adds a little plot. race is not even that exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and one that should win throws in a surprise ending.ok, i just saved you $7.00. you can send all of your money to me, because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does. don't get me wrong, the cars are awesome, and nadija is beautiful, but it is truly an awful movie.

it was almost worth sitting through this entire god-awful "film" just to know that i can never experience anything as bad as this again. acting - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl), nadia bjorlin - 10 (she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress). this is the criteria i used to average it out to a two. i lost count but i believe ever movie cliché, ever, is in this movie. when the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her, from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement. plus he just shows up for no reason. he was never even mentioned before. i don't know what else to say here. just watch it when it comes out on tv in a couple years. at least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials.

apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak. this movie was mind numbingly bad. the casting was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story filled with holes. script? who needs script? i was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be, however i got enough shots of t&a to last me a lifetime. the movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with add (who decided to buy a car instead of go to college) tell a story. being so poorly scripted, i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first. the scenes at the racetrack, along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie: fully loaded. this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself after...only the writers thought they were being serious.

i registered just to make this comment (which pretty much echos some of the ones here already) the acting is worse than subpar, it expounds on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification (all bod no brain), and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.including but not limited to "allright lets see what these guys can do" i should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves. eddie griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way. he may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesn't allow for that kind of character exploration. you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? oceans 11. this movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience.even the cars can't make up for this fluke of a movie. that enzo that griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly. it just sucks.

my favorite part was when the credits started to roll. i wish i could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10. i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back. don't waste your money or time on it. i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.nadia was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career. but she chose to be in it.all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked. more than kazaam and glitter combined. that's saying something.don'tdoit!!!!

before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars. eventually i even regretted going for that reason. plot is almost non-existent. character development is non-existent. so many clichés and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released. if not for the exotics, i wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1. an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. in fact, the movie's plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline. bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie.don't see it. play gran turismo hd instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.

whoever wrote up "redline" as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming, steaming pile of amateur crap. easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made. this makes showgirls look like citizen kane.take every cheesy cliché out of an 80s action tv series, put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business.this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever. what offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap.

after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series. so, i already expected it to have a lacking storyline, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans. unfortunately, i was wrong. if you could only imagine a fast & furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen (i'm being nice - no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). not only was the storyline non-existent, but the action was crap too. i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. for an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a slr mclaren to win. and after the bit where eddy griffin got in a fight with one of his "girls" (an imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert. after this wonderful scene i couldn't take it anymore. so, i only got to see half of this monstrosity. this is the first movie i had ever walked out on. afterwards, i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. you're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home. i will keep all viewers in my prayers.

im proud to say i've seen all three fast and furious films.sure,the plots are kinda silly,and they might be a little cheesy,but i love them car chases,and all the beautiful cars,and the clandestine midnight races.and ill gladly see a fourth one.wanna know what the difference is between those three and redline?decent acting,somewhat thought out plot,even if they are potboilers,and last but not least,directors who have a clue.all three were made by very competent directors,all of them took the films in a different direction,equally exciting.redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch,and made them the extras,then picked up his leads from hollywood's unemployment line.and the script.yikes.its mystery science theatre 3000 bad.this is 70's made for tv movie bad.yeah,the movie had a few cool cars,but you don't really get to see that many in action,and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases,and if the cars aren't thrilling you,why go to a movie like this?im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers,and i cant stop laughing out loud.im getting dirty looks,but this was just a debacle.rent the f&f movies.go to nascar race.go to a karting track and race yourself.whatever you do,avoid redline like bad cheese.

based on a self-serving novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of f. scott fitzgerald, gossip columnist sheila graham wrote this trashy story. gregory peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be-drunk-or-be-damned alcoholic; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real scott fitzgerald. focusing on fitzgerald's hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when aa was not yet well known. fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). living in a small apartment and driving a second hand chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.virtually every 20th century-fox movie made during daryll f. zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by henry king, was a work of excellence. beloved infidel was the exception.

there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time. as f. scott fitzgerald (gregory peck) and sheilah graham (deborah kerr) are lounging on the beach, suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry--at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past. this "dramatic scene" becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldn't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was...as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo. no one experiences moments like this--no one. now how much of the rest of the film is true, i cannot say, but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an $8 rolex--and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct--the film is a lot of bunk. however, i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn't seem to clear this up, either. just who were f. scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like? what i do know about fitzgerald, however, does seem different from what i saw in the film. was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film? well, considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish, i'd assume he wasn't. was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film? perhaps, but if he was this bad and yet ms. graham stayed with him, then this makes her out to be a complete dummy--and not someone you'd like to see featured in a film. and, if he wasn't, then the film does a poor disservice to his memory. either way, it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience.the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people. in a dark and salacious way, some might find this all very entertaining, but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way! unpleasant but with glossy production values (especially the music, which was lovely but way over the top) it begs the question "why did they even choose to make this in the first place?". the bottom line--it's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time--even if, like me, you are big gregory peck fan.

this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew. based on shielah graham's autobiography, it seems like the powers that be couldn't leave well enough alone. they couldn't decide if this was to be graham's story or fitzgerald's story, and also how much they should soft-pedal whoever's story it turned out to be. so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (fitzgerald) and notorious (ms. graham)personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either. added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959. clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing. however - and this saved the film for me - kerr has never looked lovelier, and peck is as always a very handsome man. they truly make a beautiful, mature couple, and i only wish they had better material to work with. there is one scene that does work - scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs. other than that, the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 (peyton place, the best of everything).

i'm sorry but i didn't like this doc very much. i can think of a million ways it could have been better. the people who made it obviously don't have much imagination. the interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered. the footage isn't assembled in a very informative way, either. it's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. one thing i'll say is that isabella rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. all considered, this only gets a '4.'

dooohhh! my bwainn hurrrts! well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film. how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows. maybe it's me!!maybe i don't get the premise of the film... or maybe i don't appreciate it's alleged mystical atmosphere. in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonalds.in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom & jerry cartoon. yaarrrghhh! why do i do it? why do i watch such tripe? it's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion!! yaargh!! an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect. apart from that it's not to bad.

1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(dir-michael almereyda): weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. at least i think that was the relationship. a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king's the shining. the difference is that there was campiness in nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all. the performances are not the problem here, but the story is. everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film.

this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen. i love almereyda's nadja, but this is just absolute dreck. aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material. jared harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. the plot is a joke, but not the haha kind. i don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad. please erase the last hour and a half of my life. how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet?

i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as "the return of the texas chainsaw massacre", but this film compete with it.i´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but i did it 15 minutes after the trance started. i woke up, and started to watching it agian. why did i deserve that? all the movie was a torture, i have to use fast forward to watch it complete.i can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time (mr. walken) could done this thing. i have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...what about the movie? it´s not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but i really liked the one played by jared harris), effects are very poor, lack of deaths & blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. and i mean it. can´t stand how a director can make a film like this.anyway, when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by "stephen king", i think he could never present this crap, no? (i rented it in argentina). i not recommend it in a million years.i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (as i say in my "return of the texas chainsaw massacre" review, there will be always a worse movies, thats why it don´t deserves a 1 out of 10)

well - when the cameo appearance of jason miller (looking even more eroded than he did in exorcist iv) is the high point of a picture, what've you got?it's a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll: mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog-dried mummy (have you figured that one out yet - dried in a bog?) in the basement, christopher walken with a bad dye job, and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they'd developed her.i understand - sort of - that they're going back to visit her relatives. after that....problem: there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing (i think). this is never connected to anything. problem: what do we need the grandmother for? now, the grandmother could be interesting. she speaks gaelic, or celtic, or something. maybe you can make something of her. the best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit. that's all.problem: they cast a real shifty character as the husband. is he type-cast (will he sell his wife to the devil? maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her)or is he cast against type (after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? he drinks, he hesitates. he's not a bad guy. not a good one. but dislikable. why didn't they do something with him?no problem: an old boyfriend shows up. the husband knocks him down. he comes back to knock down the husband. (it gets pretty stupid, but at least that character has motivation.) now - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he might only have married her for her money. the grandmother is locked in the bedroom. the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch (are you following this?) who may come to life. in fact, you know she'll come to life, the music swells. a little girl lives in the house, takes tea to the grandmother (unlocks the door to do so) and provides granny with cigarettes. periodically, granny gets out. but nothing happens. husband and wife lose the kid in the house, subsequently lose their bedroom. uncle gets his throat cut in the basement. the leading lady has nose-bleeds. the husband drinks. they both drink. in the face of all of this, the awful truth alluded to in the first over-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.in spite of all these dangling-thread ingredients, nobody managed to get a story on the screen. no bridge between situations, no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror, just long slow scenes that go nowhere.;nbody, really, to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks,the grandmother who might be locked up because she's a monster, but no, her worst fault is smoking. she's got great hair, good makeup. in short, no plot. just a little random (predictable)violence in a dark library, with the rain gushing in, and the sound track cuing us in. you need more than a few drunks and christopher walken to make a movie.the production values were good. oh. nice scenery, good wardrobe. the cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing.i bought it. poor me.

a young american woman visits her irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her. sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, i got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going. the movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the irish-american woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past? the director can't seem to decide. the two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. this could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end. this was most boring and disappointing.

this film takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it. nora and jim are alcoholics who go to ireland to dry-out. they go to stay with her nan and uncle. the uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in the peat. he revives her and she takes the form of nora. she cannot be killed conventionally,(more is the pity). nora, however, works out a way to do so.this is a gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap. it is a sprawling mess. i have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film. i am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear.avoid at all costs

upon concluding my viewing of "trance," or "the eternal," or whatever the producers are calling this film, i wondered to myself, "out of all of the bad movies i could have seen, couldn't i have at least seen one that was entertaining?" even if a film is not well made in terms of acting, directing, writing, or what have you, it can at least be fun, and therefore worthwhile. but not only is this film bad in artistic value, it's incredibly boring. for a plot of such thinness, it moves awfully slowly, with little dramatic tension. at the very least, in a low-brow attempt at entertainment, the deaths of the characters could have been cool and/or gory, but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well.what does this movie have going for it? pretty much nothing, unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken, who is capable of being brilliant, put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-parody mode (why did he decide to do this film anyway?).i give this film 3/10, because, god help us, there actually have been worse movies made before.

this movie is more deceiving than ever, using a suspenseful looking actor like walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one! and the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets, or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there. i'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes. leave this one alone,please!

this is a total waste of money. the production is poor, the special effects are terrible. in my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as "the mummy" because of the success of brendan fraser`s film. i`m sure that you can find better horror movies.

this movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. cheesy special effects and so-so acting. i could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy. if there was more of a background story, it would have been better. the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. christopher walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie. this movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie. i would avoid this movie.

saw a trailer for this on another video, and decided to rent when it came out. boy, was i disappointed! the story is extremely boring, the acting (aside from christopher walken) is bad, and i couldn't care less about the characters, aside from really wanting to see nora's husband get thrashed. christopher walken's role is such a throw-away, what a tease!

the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside? characters just "showing up" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, i might add)? all in all it wasn't "bad". i rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, the little slave girl, alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining. alice's smoking, drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting. i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation, and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie.

yikes did this movie blow. the characters were weak, the plot weaker. i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has christoper walken, oops. he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money. the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent. i am desperately trying to find something nice about this, i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character. find something to read, or watch discovery, don't ever see this movie.

this film seems to be completely pointless. there is no reason why anything that happens in it happens, as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought "how can i wrap this up?". and what were jared harris and christopher walken thinking? did they do it for a bet? i couldn't tell you the plot, i'm not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank, but if there is it didn't register. jared and his bird go to ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up, as you do. they go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it, meet christopher walken who has dug up some ancient woman preserved in peat. he brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing him. from then on it all gets a bit silly. a couple of hours of my life that i'd like back!

now don't get me wrong, i do enjoy christmas movies. i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular movie is awful. i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful. albert finney sings fairly well in annie. i don't know whats wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this movie for us was shutting the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd.

i couldn't not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here -- it's that bad). this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ("thank you very much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again.the only entertaining part of this movie (completely unintentional by the way) involves alec guinness as jacob marley. dressed in a silly powder white costume, guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie. albert finney, meanwhile, blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo/scrooge. finney's scrooge is so hideous a person, it's impossible to believe his transformation.steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs.

this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen. they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.the songs rarely move along the story. they seem to be thrown in at random. the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous.it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen, but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen.it's probably only considered a classic because "a christmas carol" is such a classic story. just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is.

this wasn't really a very good movie. there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film...but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. this movie was produced by magic johnson! isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film? a film produced by a former nba star doesn't come along every day, you know. beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho. every cliché trotted out for us to groan over. teen sex. and it was all produced by magic johnson! i can't say enough about this movie! teen drug use! college hijinx! and it was all produced by magic johnson! yippeeee!

kill me later" has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (selma blair) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber (max beesley) who promises to "kill her later."the actual execution of this premise, however, falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion. shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around. lack of character depth especially diminishes selma blair's performance, whose character shawn vacillates from being morose to acting "cool" and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt. this is unfortunate, as under other circumstances ms. blair is an appealing and capable actress.compounding matters for the worse is director dana lustig's insistence on using rapid cuts, incongruous special effects (e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end), and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the mtv crowd. certainly ms. lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction, but in no way does her skill help overcome the film's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end. clearly, lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.the producers (ram bergman & lustig)can be commended for their ability to realize this film: they were able to scare up $1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. this is no small feat for an independent film. yet given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.

this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush. i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by. however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding, this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing. the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add, many times before. there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others. i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space. in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film. what i've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review, than for god's sake don't waste more time watching this movie. the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at 2:00 a.m. in that case go ahead see what i care.

despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered "old" and out-of-date a few years ago. the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. the script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). but the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. the performance by the actor who plays selma blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. i did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch.

i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes, but 20-minutes in i was liberally applying the fast-forward button. far too many shots of stewart (michael zelniker) walking from room to room, down hallways, through doors and down the street, and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused. gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director grieve and star zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay).it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before, or if the ending wasn't - disappointingly - the one i had predicted three minutes into the film (atypical for an independent/smaller studio film). at least its heart was in the right place - it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense.

i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen.the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous. i get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown, but it got so silly and boring, after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters.the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there.then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer, and the confusing ones where he meets himself.i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors. do yourself a favor when this movie comes up, read a book! you'll be better off.

this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen - several times on stage apart from the movie.a very nice idea for the set up - the american south can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round hero's supposed misdemeanour.but the execution! widdoes is a very mannered beatrice giving a particularly poor performance. waterston, a fine actor, is not much better as benedict.the poorest performance is in the role of don john - it makes keanu reeves look good. perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of dogberry and his men - but the acting makes you want to cringe.successful set-ups include the scene where they fool benedict into believing beatrice loves him - were the acting competent it would be superb. but the use of the river and the visual humour of benedict moving closer is well produced.overall i had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn't keep my attention.very disappointing.with respect to latter comments above i am nearly 40. i've been watching stage and screen productions of shakespeare for over 2 decades. might i suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact. i can assume though, from your distaste regarding youth, that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste.my personal favourite pairing was rylance and mcteer on the london stage. unlike widdoes, mcteer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can act.

this is a very bland and inert production of one of shakespeare's most vibrant plays. i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before. by doing this, though - by making every line clear and every intent obvious - they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature. somehow, it is actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful material.the acting is forgettable at best - sam waterston as benedick and douglas watson as don pedro. others, however, do not fare so well. april shawnham's hero is a pouty, breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces. jerry mayer's don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of snidely whiplash (though snidley was much more enjoyable).f. murray abraham (you know, the guy who killed mozart?) is not in this version, unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits.given that the producer, joseph papp, is basically a theater god, this production is not only disappointing but head-scratching as well.don't bother with this. watch branagh's much ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor, to say nothing of wonderful performances.

painful. painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play. i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it. to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much ado was, i pity you and your bored brain. may your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution. please do not even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama. you will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place.

i've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all. the play of the actors weren't any better.of course shahrukh khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting.i've read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert "madame bovary" yet for me i didn't see it matching with the indian mentality.in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. i just can't understand how it could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8/10.so it's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it! you will just waste your time unless if you like "dark movie" with "strange and non sense story".

maya is a woman without any interests. she just dreams her life away and wonders, why she does not feel fulfilled. this could be an interesting topic. that would need a good story, a nice setting and good dialogues. it doesn't have any of these. this movie is totally boring. there are only lengths and no climaxes.the only climax is shahrukh khan. but although i am a huge fan of his, i couldn't stand this movie. even he can't make this movie exiting. the movie is not as bad as "king uncle" and if you're an art-house fan or like it slow, you might maybe like it. it's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. my recommendation: don't watch it.

impressed! this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw! i didn't like the novel, but this movie made it worse! very bad music, even worse actors (apart from srk of course, though even he doesn't manage to save the movie), and not much sense. the director makes it all look very confusing, god knows why... maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic, and yet credible. well, he manages neither.even if you've got a few hours to loose, don't watch this movie, please! (saying this for your own welfare!) keep searching, you will find something else to watch!

ok, i am not a professional movie critic but come on...a true story!!!!they are tunneling under another store to get underneath the bank and stumble across a tomb. at tomb with a passageway which goes directly under the bank.ok, i'll play along.but then they get into the bank and decide to go to sleep. yeah!!! i am sure with all the adrenaline pumping through them they are going to just fall asleep. this blows the whole picture!!!! how lame!!!!!glad i didn't have to pay to watch this one.

"the man in the attic" is a movie set in the 1910s. it is inspired by a true story. unfortunately, it's a story that really didn't need to be told.looking at the box, the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic. they use terms such as "illicit passion", "forbidden affair", and "unlimited pleasures". they even show a picture of neil patrick harris (little doogie howser, m.d.) holding a gun!the story involves krista, played by anne archer. she is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business. edward (harris) is an employee of her husband's company. krista and edward end up falling in love with each other.the supposedly "shocking" part of the movie is this: krista's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again. so what do they decide to do? krista ends up having edward live up in their attic. wow! krista ends up seeing someone else and edward gets extremely jealous. so on and so on and so on."the man in the attic" doesn't cover any new territory. it's a showtime original picture, which explains why the stars are a couple of b-list actors and both appear briefly in the buff.

ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? or any taiwanese movie? propably for a reason. this one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.having read other peoples thoughts, i was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. some blood puking and other lame stuff, if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed. they clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent.pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few ok black magic spells, like the eel one. the plot was confusing and boring. the characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. the horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really). this is the worst asian horror movie i have ever seen.

this is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older, married lover after she gets pregnant; she avenges herself against him, and his entire family, through black magic  which, disappointingly, she doesn't do herself but has someone else do for her. good production values for a thai horror flick. but the bland script never generates suspense, the director approaches the material entirely conventionally, and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds. at one point, a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead, and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun. bad writing  you're soaking in it! some icky gore effects, including a really tasteless late-term-fetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach. only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in asia in the last 15 years.

i absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on. its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. what happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.

i feel like i've just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing! a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse, abuse. no redemption whatsoever. and i was entertained. i couldn't stop watching. what does this say about me, about the people who make and act in this sort of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. and i'm neither puritanical nor humorless, i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness, and i definitely have not led a sheltered life, but i am ashamed of myself. and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. it doesn't have to be cozy, but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism?

no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. as a bbc licence payer, after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment. i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines. these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas!paul bentley, west yorkshire, england.

don't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot. i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re: death on the nile. everyone has done this one! we know who dies. we know why they die. we know who the killer is. we know how it was done. so i say enough already! mr. suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels. i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. the sets were terrific and very realistic. i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. somehow i don't think so. i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms. christie wrote it that way. i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison!

got into this flick, just as it was beginning, on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu - otherwise i'd have missed it. that probably would have been best.i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas - both very good performers - and thought this might be worth a look. it proved to be to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinates.zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talents, except for her jayne mansfield- or loni anderson-like bosom. unfortunately, her acting prowess - at least here - makes mansfield and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison.the young nut case's white rat, the owner's cat, the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home, and a bunch of doophus's (including the young nut case) running around a bio hazard facility, and the absurd conclusion. i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism, believability or being capable of evoking some empathy/sympathy -- but this proved to be in vain.

there was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film(zoe mclellan) but even her looks couldn't stop me from voting it the lowest possible - one.the plot is bad and irrational.what more can i say. the movie sucks.

this lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity.here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce, helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. she has even started up a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger perhaps, landscape architect / gardener (who's black). but then horror of middle-aged women's horrors, another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to, starts 'taking over" her life.what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener, and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! and backed up the toilet! and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! and hangs her pieces of (african) artwork in the living room!! and so on. well she may have killed the cat as well. yeah, ok, the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough, but its more than a little ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (so why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors, a much younger woman?)supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking, of course) 20 something. but there's this problem. anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. (well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. it just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.)the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things, and the 20 something has had help. the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending, the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. you know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. finally the 40 something's "heroic" battle back for the house then begins. woopie!!the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative), when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. (this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime.the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic, and isn't taking her medicine. even so it makes no sense. she isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband, though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. she's after the house (technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce, after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband!! (the ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter, he still strayed!!!)the protagonist is good enough looking for her age. but her outlook, attitude and focus is so small minded, frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. well, a core group of lifetime fans care, i guess, judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. i couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.)** spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick).well, here's a clue. the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to "listen to" her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover, and "do whatever he says" and "let him take care of her" (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to the house. there she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something, who is taking a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. there's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. she then begins stroking her, mom like, and the two women have a bonding, female solidarity moment!!! how sweet.

anyone who's watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table. so, when crazed lara moves into patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers, i didn't even blink. when lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor patti, and dares her to do anything about it, i just nodded. you see, on planet lmn, people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. only on planet lmn could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers!! poor patti - she just trusted too much, and lara went off her medicine, and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone's tummy, and a body bag going out the front door. the horror!but take it from me, this planet lmn product is a classic. you need to watch it once, just for the great laughs you'll have. on the improbability scale, i give this film a 95/100. make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices, too. you'll understand later.

this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen. this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility (like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon), and the bad acting. it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. however, the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box, does so at the same time a bank heist is going down, at the same fbi agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one. however, the results do not make for an enticing action film, but instead, one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film). what the hell ron perlman was doing in this, i have no idea. i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it.

mr perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). sadly, he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces.larsen is in "die hard" mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles, i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.the lovely erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of "getting" acting at last.sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies.the shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the a-teamnot even worth seeing for perlman - avoid

i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. danny glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. also, jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student. the tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. the finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. all we could wait for was the end of the movie. all in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.

sorry, not good.it starts out interesting, but looses its way a few minutes into the movie.it does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors (quaid, glover, ermey, leto etc.) delivers a really good performance. it might be owed to the fact that i saw a dubbed version (german), but dennis quaid's character was especially wooden and annoying, and danny glover does not really make for a believable villain. moreover, jared leto's character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever (except saving one main character's life at one point, but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-)speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and cliché-ridden storyline: the detective (of course!) has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement. the killer (of course!) *wants* to be tracked down and plays a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... i don't know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better, however.the plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all (e.g. the truck stop scene or the car at the cliff's edge etc.)to top it off, the ending tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in these regards. we've seen *much* better finales with a similar kind of ultimate-battle-on-a-train-in-a-forlorn-winter-landscape setup ... in the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child ... hokey, at the least.

for me, this movie just seemed to fall on its face. the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer. i don't know whether this grows out of type-casting or simply his demeanor, but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain. he's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story. nothing very innovative .

wonderful actors. lousy script and not too great direction either. my main problem was i simply didn't care about any of these people. not the killer not the victims. the settings were pretty drab. dennis quaid's character was so poorly written in, i didn't even care when the end came. he got his kid back. big deal! i wanted my money back.

i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly. danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had. i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. i'd watch it again though. i rated it a 5 (wish i could rate it a 5.5)

i didn't mind the film that much, but it was incredibly dull and boring. a few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for. you should give it a go if you like silly, stupid humour because this is the film for you.

this may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and i want it back!chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies. some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. there's not much middle ground in this category. although chris farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not so funny, and then dead...so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career.avoid this movie like the plague.c

chris kattan is a great sketch actor on saturday night live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. he plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. wanna know the only funny parts? the stuff they showed in the previews. yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. nothing else is. especially when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one. and yet, his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad. this movie made me develop an eye twitch. avoid it at all costs, and keep watching snl.

admittedly, i didn't have high expectations of "corky romano." but then again, who did? however, i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt. i had no high hopes of "joe dirt" either--another recent comedy starring an snl cast member--and i ended up being pleasantly surprised. but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews. chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor--contrary to what you might think after watching this movie--with great energy. he's been in many hilarious snl skits, and i think he's one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now. in this case, he's given a lame, pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging. throughout each scene, he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably. jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy, not to mention he worked with much better writing. kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes. he doesn't even wait for the punchline; he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack. in one scene, he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth. the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him. he comes back to the job, strung out on coke. now, how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on-edge, when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film? as for the rest of the cast members...vanessa shaw is really hot, peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn. peter falk is also wasted, though he has a few funny lines that i'm pretty sure he improvised. i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon. that's too much talent too waste on a clunker like "corky romano." i didn't like falk's last movie "made" all that much either, but at least he had a decent role. i chuckled a few times, but i could not get a single laugh. each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery. and it's made worse by kattan's hammy acting. and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out. for example, when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers' faces. he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes, trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one. it's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out, but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse. and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust. i can go on and on about what's wrong with this so-called comedy, but i'm not gonna waste my time. like i said earlier, if you predicted bad things from the trailers--you predicted right. my score: 3 (out of 10)

unfortunately, this movie is so bad. the original out of towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by neil simon. for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. even the audience i was with never laughed. the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. the couple having sex in the park. they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie & steve do a bit of slap stick. the whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. you will also notice every close up of goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis, that's if you want to laugh.

bruce lee was a great martial artist, but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made. it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air. it just gets downright absurd from then, like something out of a cheap comic book. maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view. there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there, usually all made in hong kong. i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera. even steven seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong. 'game of death ii' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion, despite bruce lee being in it.

i found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow "upbeat" ending that didn't ring true to the overall story. following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and i got very tired of its "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end--in fact i almost stopped about halfway through. the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and i love good, small films! this one just didn't jell, though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. i was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "year's 10 best" list. i'd strongly recommend watching "the house of sand" instead--now there's a good, small film!

this is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief. as such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters. however, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. the camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, disjointed effect. most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met). the storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. in sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing. in spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.

something i really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in "living with happiness." this film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue, patchy performances and very television coverage.it's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. but the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much.i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity.

the film had some likable aspects. perhaps too many for my taste. it felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters. not once, a few times...but all of the time. this is the job of television, not cinema. the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler's performance as the pregnant friend. i felt as though justine clarke's performance was wan. her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions. i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence. i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences. this is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest. that said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality. it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm. i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked. "who knows if there's a god? like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line was. perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife "i'm giving up smoking." an anti-smoking commercial? a tac ad with some tasteful animation? i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much.

"ask the dust" looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all of the actors. unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. it practically seemed to satirize itself, and to no entertaining effect. after seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and i walked out, valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense. it simply was not interesting, moving, funny nor artistic. it appears as though it were written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse yet, it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.

a film starring salma hayek and colin farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. an independent film sounds even better. the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity.but then why is this movie so bland? ask the dust.this film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. no one is given a proper back story, so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do.explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have one left at the end of this movie.i told a friend that i went to see this film, and that i thought it was awful.her question: "not even colin farrell could save it?" my response: "not even colin farrell's ass could save it."

i love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film. i love salma hayek. i was more than ready to love this picture. but . . .booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ! ! ! !! ! no sir, nothing good about this. the only entertaining aspect for me was colin farrell's character is an insecure writer and this screenplay, despite tackling the juicy subject of racism, approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc afterschool special.the only person who didn't sound like he was "acting' was sutherland, and his minutes were few.stale approach to a tired plot.

it must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film. probably cruise, the exec. prod., saw what was happening and had towne use much, much more of the nude footage in the final cut then towne wanted to, to make up for the disaster he saw looming.(maybe cruise even thought of "titanic".)a few items: colin farrell can't act his way out of a paper bag. but he's one of the flavors-of-the-decade, a producer's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films. he has so many moments of not believing in what he's doing and you can see it in his eyes. i think he would have been at his best as a film actor, albeit not as rich or famous as he is now, playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act. the trap of spending a lot of money for period sets, costumes, cars, et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash/wax. no one seems to want anything to look, well, worn. or dirty. is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didn't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items?this was a story about the depression-thirties folks, not a disney broadway musical about that era. how about doing it in black and white or better yet, given caleb deschanel as your d.p., have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times. it should have been, after all, a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did, in the depression. more on farrell. did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer? h.l. mencken on the wall; did i see his eyes roll at one point? hayek and farrell as a sexually dynamic duo? sending a boy to do a man's work? perhaps in the book, which i haven't read, the story was about an older woman and a youth. i cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because i bailed out early on. but the memory of the scenes i did see made me think that someone was doing a not-too-amusing parody of a noir movie. sort of what saturday night live has been like for the past decade: not funny. (in my mind i kept thinking of a guy noir sketch, music and all.)

a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski. i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'ask the dust' was the first fante book i read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. in the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching hollywood ending. the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock. i can't believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong.

this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust. colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile. donald sutherland comes across as an amateur. why? because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted. the atmosphere of the movie is bad - i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way. the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance. the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience. in one word, it is a terrible film.

this is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good film. sure, the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of los angeles in the thirties--i especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram rising up the hillside--but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating, because it creates a mood that "something's going to happen"--and nothing does. the script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma--and time after time not delivering. not even delivering the (i assume) theme of the movie, the characters' essential misfit. the lead actors, both too pretty for their roles, didn't convey any repression or agony, and the script didn't expose us to any.now, donald sutherland? that's another story. his character was so well fashioned, so perfectly played, that i wanted the camera to follow him.

one of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out. if i hadn't been with my wife, who wanted to stay, i would have left. it's a shame, too, because i think it could have been a good movie. but this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays i've ever seen. it starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere (i would say it goes nowhere fast, but it really goes nowhere slow...painfully slow). from time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters, but that's all we get - hints. there is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie. not that i need a slick plot to be entertained...i love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff. but these characters add up to nothing. for the entire duration of the film you don't care what happens to a single one of them. as a matter of fact, you almost start hoping they die, because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you'd think it in itself would be compelling, but it's not. instead of quirky, noir-esquire characters acting in hard-boiled fashion, you simply recognize it immediately for what it is: a bunch of talented but miscast actors, brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. all this for two plodding, painfully slow hours. awful.

i'll be blunt. i'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who's not going to take any crap from anyone. if any one of the cast members wanted to, they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat. it was entertaining on mst 3k, but don't rent the real version. trust me. have i ever lied to you?

sure it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western. instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. she becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she is only a tad bit upset by this. her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. so this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but i guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it. the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. this movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of mst3000 they made. i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful. corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another.

i guess that "gunslinger" wasn't quite as god-awful as most of the movies that "mystery science theater 3000" shows, but westerns just aren't roger corman's forte. portraying rose hood (beverly garland) becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies, the movie is pretty predictable. john ireland is rose's new hubby, secretly working for unctuous allison hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). also appearing briefly is frequent corman co-star dick miller as a mailman (miller nowadays stars in joe dante's movies).i do wish to assert that you'll probably want to watch the "mst3k" version to really enjoy this movie. they had a great time with it.

beverly garland was born in the wrong time. she was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the corman films she starred in. in gunslinger, she's the town sheriff's wife. he gets offed, so she takes over his job to pursue his killers. she's better than the material she's working with, by far. the movie is gray, stilted, and mostly boring. there's some(unintentional)humor with the tire tracks everywhere, people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another (i've heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her. even if she hadn't loved her husband, it had only been something like a week or two since he'd died! and she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end, anyway. no luck with men, this one.the villain of the piece is another woman, the saloon owner. she's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich. her plan of action if it doesn't is pretty lame-she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle. hell, it's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town. are you telling me these people aren't armed? look what happened in real towns of the old west when bank robbers came in to rob the bank, then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk.there'a a lot of pointless talking and riding around, interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. the ending is as grim as usual in a corman flick, although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in it conquered the world. the sheriff turns over her badge to sam bass and rides off into the sunset, although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun.

- when the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she's doing. when the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. there's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love.- gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. there's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. in more capable hands or with a larger budget, gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west. as it is, gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie.- there are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. but the biggest offender is the editing. i was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for corman to yell "action". the best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. all of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. or, take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. we see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse.- it's not as if corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. while none were great stars, beverly garland, john ireland, and allison hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. but, in gunslinger, they're not given much to work with.- i have now seen both the mst3k and non-mst3k versions of the movie. i would strongly recommend going the mst3k route.

i'll admit that i don't expect much from a roger corman film. generally, i expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. yet in this case, i am pleasantly surprised.the gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky beverly garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. ms. garland is a pretty good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew. the bar's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the (hoped-for) railroad. however, ms. garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar matron hires a man to kill ms. garland.because of ms. garland's plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne somers "she's the sheriff" jokes. with the exception of a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens out from the inside, jeep tracks, and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner), the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare. however, corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes, much like he does walking in other films.sterno says the gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time.

being a big fan of corman's horror movies i expected from his western a bit more than i got. well, i was entertained all right. i had almost as many laughs as watching mel brooks' blazing saddles.see the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west. you can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on. and the horses seem to have gears in them too, considered the fast-forward chases. see also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920's, here decades before the style was invented. hope the saloon around them won't crumple.in the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job. ireland, garland and hayes are all truly fine. a special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from 'johnny guitar', but doesn't quite impress the same way. but there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. just like a really bad old horror movie, it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway. that is one of the reasons corman's work appeals to me and that is why i dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance.

generally i don't like films directed by sydney pollack ("the firm" being somewhat of an exception) and i've never been a robert redford fan either. still, i thought "three days of the condor" must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received.although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer, i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing. the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense.the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway? i'd much rather watch any of hitchcock's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more.

1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10(dir-sydney pollack):-dvd version i watched titled "3 days of the condor"- so so cia drama full of laid-back performances making for a very laid-back movie. the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford's character, codename = condor, being the one that was left. who killed them and why? that's what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time. along the way, he gets faye dunaway's character involved involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey-dovey time. this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn't have a lot of suspense. the flat performances don't help and the finish doesn't seal the deal for the audience enough either. despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers, the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be.

i cannot get past the message of this movie. it's laid out much too clearly to ignore, and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it's about. i haven't read the novel, but pollack's film opens with a scene at a cia-front organization in new york, which is broken into by two professional assassins, headed by max von sydow, who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we've come to know and understand. the staff include an elderly female receptionist, a fussy elderly professorial guy who's toupee falls off when he is machine-gunned (is that a joke?), and, last, the beautiful tina chen who looks up from the copier, realizes she is about to be murdered, and says, pitifully brave, "i won't scream." von sydow replies sympathetically, "i know." these murders are completely unexpected, savage, unmotivated by anything that we are aware of, and graphic. it is a brutal scene. there is absolutely no way in which von sydow and his henchman can be redeemed. and yet that is exactly what pollack tries to do towards the end.after having killed these innocent good guys, von sydow switches sides (because the other side is willing to pay him) and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural cia plot. the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable, sensitive human being. "it is better to live in europe. things are not so rushed." or whatever. i swear i'm not making this up. pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat. that's the message. you should write it down in case you forget. just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values, not to mention common sense, upside-down like that? i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states, even hate it, and who see conspiracies just about everywhere, providing a knee-jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events. i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends. nevertheless, at some point this dislike, this hatred, if it increases in intensity, must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric. i don't for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official. i don't care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the louvre on the metro. whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation.i'd like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message, but i can't. it's quite well done. (in some ways that's worse, because it makes the film less dismissable.) even new york city looks photogenic on the screen. and it's been a long time since i've thought of new york as photogenic. robert redford does an admirable job of projecting his character's initial shock and confusion, but then turns into a telecommunicational semi-genius. and, man, he looks just fine! his wardrobe is just right. even his rimless glasses are becoming. and his peacoat. it's not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous. he seems extremely handsome too, the swine. i want to look like that. i want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache. faye dunaway is alright in her role but it's not too believable a role. would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint? even if he did look like redford? would anyone be emotionally wounded if, when this ambivalent relationship is about to end, redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened? cliff robertson is surprisingly good. he does one or two extremely good double-takes. the mailman is superb. the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and, for once, we really don't know for sure how it will turn out, because redford (a book reader after all) seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin. this is one of john housemann's final roles. a shame. he's a magnet on screen. and what an end to his life: a friend finds him lost, wandering the streets of new york, in a neighborhood he'd been familiar with for most of his life. yes, the movie is very well executed, but i can't ignore that vicious, paranoid message. i have the same problem with leni riefenstahl's "triumph of the will." or her olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which jesse owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously, "this negro is dangerous."

the small california town of diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez unearths an ancient box.legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth-century mexican demon named azar.fbi agent gil vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff's daughters,dominique and mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon."the legend of diablo" is an absolute garbage.the film lacks scares and gore,the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad.the animation is the only one aspect of the film i enjoyed.i'm a big fan of indie horror flicks,for example i loved "torched","live feed","bone sickness" or "neighborhood watch",unfortunately "the legend of diablo" is a huge misfire.definitely one to avoid.

this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production, ever.1. the most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy is walking... and walking... and walking (spoiler). there is about 15 minutes of just walking. how? 2. not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day. 3. the acting was terrible. it looks like they found a community theater (in mexico)... and then took the people who were turned away.please, for the love of everything holy, don't rent this movie. if you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public.

me, my boyfriend, and our friend watched this "movie" if thats what u wanna call it, and we agree with the last person, but we were stupid and bought the damn thing, we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it.we hate it really suxz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so beware: do not buy this thing they call a movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!we would return it, but don't no if anybody would want this stupid movie.oh and another thing, the shouldn't call it "the legend of diablo" they should of called it "legend of azar".and this movie is rated r????? this should not of even been not rated.we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie.this is a movie that would have been done by a church.theses "actors" are never gonna become nothing because this movie.

the good news is a movie was made, drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec-american (is such a word exists) cast. the bad news is, it was dead at birth.if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic 'night of the living dead,' this is what we might have come up with. 'the legend of diablo' is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of 'mystery science theatre 3000!'i don't think one can even call this a 'b' movie. the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8-mm film shot by a group of school kids. some spoilersthe basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it. a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community. his daughters, one hot and one homely, team with a gringo fbi man and a priest, to try to re-cage the demon. meanwhile, every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re-enacted-poorly. these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead! the supposed infrared scenes from the demon's viewpoint are nothing special  and he/she/it sure seems to back up a lot (as opposed to turning around the moving forward). and the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fast-motion is ludicrous! it really, really appears to be done for comic effect-although i know it wasn't! i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing & for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach!of course the darth vader/field of dreams voice, calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical. then again, so was most of this cheese ball! robert napton, director and writer of the screenplay, should win something for this effort! (how about a lifetime blackballing, like the 'hollywood 10?') this one, i now see, is rated 1.5 on a 10-scale. i fear this might be a tad generous! is there anything good about this movie? well, lindsey lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff. this is probably why her homely older sister (calvi pabon) really ran away from home! fred estrado is reasonably decent as the fbi agent. i wonder if mario soto, who played father rodriguez, is the same mario soto who pitched for the cincinnati reds? if so, he should have stuck to baseball. in fact, they couldn't have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it 'demons in the outfield!'if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class, i will issue apologies. it might be good enough for a b or even b+ as long as the gang got the college's camcorder back to campus in one piece! 'the blair witch project' proved that a cool, campy movie could be made on a shoestring. 'the legend of diablo,' though, didn't appear to have a shoestring or shoes to work from! it was low-budget, low-talent, low-everything. the very final scene-and i mean about the final 10 seconds of the film-is the only mildly creative or interesting moment.i paid $3.45 to rent this. i could have better spent it on a hamburger!

it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, but hostel is definitely much more worse. this movie is more funny and ridiculous, than scary. i laughed most of the time when watched it. low quality effects (when you gonna watch it, you'll understand what i'm talking about and how low quality is that), bad actors (i hear of them for the first time), and it seems like it's shot by an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a tv show, than a movie). but at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end. like comedies? watch it. wanna horror? go watch ju-on: the grudge or some other good horror movie.if i'm talking about the legend of diablo, i don't even know if i can classify it to a horror genre. just some low-budget crap.i rate it 3 out of 10

this isn't cinema. it isn't talent. it isn't informative. it isn't scary. it isn't entertaining. it isn't anything at all.i got this because my cousin says, "diablo! cool!" yeah, right. the only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that i didn't buy it but rented it instead.it's shot like a bad soap opera. no wait. soap operas at least look professional...sorta. this? this looks like it was shot with someone's camcorder. it's horrid! wretched! it sux.the cinematography is detestable! who is this director anyway? i don't even care enough to look him up. he stinks! the performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap-fest deserved.2.6/10 on the "b" scale. that registers about a 0.3/10 on the "a" scale from...the fiend :.

as a mystery science theatre 3000 fan, i can withstand any motion picture that can be foisted upon me, but there is absolutely no reason for this.rated "super action" in the blockbuster video section and given the dreaded "restricted viewing sticker" i'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker (ha!) robert napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.shame on you robert napton! shame on you for exploiting these poor mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in american cinema. you are a disgrace!there isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action. did you use snot on these people? oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! like all 6 of them. and isn't that an asian guy in the background? why is it always daytime? why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything.. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2?ps: you owe me 4.50.

i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen! i read the comment from gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. unless gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all.i couldn't believe gumby-8's comments. quoting: "from the "dune" inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected."the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving, well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of $100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. as far as "repeat viewing is not unexpected" i think he made a typo.another quote from gumby-8 the only fan: "the acting is also a strong aspect of the film."with all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert napton.the catchy tagline: "beware the hour between dusk and darkness"that's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie.mpaa rating "rated r for some violence/gore"the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. as far as i know it might be a clump of grass.in summation, i have seen horror flicks from the 50's, 60's and 70's. i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. the director of this film either did not make any attempt, was asleep, or took a hit of acid. whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. i would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'b' movie.

as has been noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "you've got mail", with tom hanks and meg"trout pout" ryan. of the several versions, this is my least favorite. the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma, which doesn't quite cut it here.the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie. there are no real sparks. van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts, pleasant but bland. and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. judy in particular is disappointing. she looks like she has no neck! i don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell, all hunched up and everything. i couldn't figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about. i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. and van wasn't great either. i've always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here.if you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie. but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection.

one can only assume that robert osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the tcm library as this would explain him extolling the 'virtues' of this "charming" film during his introduction when i saw this on cable tv. seeing as any old film on imdb receives 'classic' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers, i thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film.this is not your father's 'shop around the corner'. for all my quibbles with 'you've got mail', it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable. for those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be all the more obvious.from one of the lamest meet cute sequences i can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor'), this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. this 'musical' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. there are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's judy singing "i don't care" while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. the christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here. miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical films, but here she seems horribly miscast. the role was originally to have been filled by june allyson and judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of margaret sullavan's old part. van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type. the leads never achieve the chemistry of stewart/sullavan or even that of hanks/ryan.this is a film that knows (some of) the notes, but not the music. it doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for van johnson's character to complicate things unnecessarily. the remake's substitution for the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. it is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of three's company by someone with a delorean and a flux capacitor. it's really just an excuse for a keaton pratfall. even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. after seeing both films, you'll understand why they called it 'the lubitsch touch' and not the 'robert z. leonard touch'.avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of judy garland's earlier films unless you're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth.

this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series.compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap.the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. thats basiclly the idea every episode. the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina. so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says "just adore me for now" and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god. (which is quite right since he's her mind control slave) but this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort.

i expected a comedy like the "big mama" movies. instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story.this movie has three plots: the first involves madea and her taking in a foster child. the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father.there is actually very little comedy in the movie. there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. for example, madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. the child does, in fact, turn herself around. apparently, it pays to beat children.there are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). there are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (the ogling takes place at a family reunion.) the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama? it is, in fact, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.

i saw the movie last night here at home, but i thought it was too long first of all. second, the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before. the things isn't funny in the movie: fiancé hitting his girlfriend, beatings. the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry, you can do better then this!

the original show was so much better. they should have left on a good note. this movie killed the whole idea. it was boring, over-dramatic, and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack. this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious, and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel. not to mention, that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. so, sorry, tyler perry, but try harder next time. this movie is just kinda dull, and not that funny either. sorry. 4/10 stars is it.jay addison

i'm a black man living in a predominantly black city. that being said, i have some major misgivings about tyler perry's work. i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him, because he's black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture. but, i honestly do believe that, were perry white, this film would have had the naacp, al sharpton, and jessie jackson all over his ass.i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil. the characters are poorly written and acted. the jokes are so bad, i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny. i'm just going to break this big pile of sh-t down.madea=suck. the character may have had some appeal, but it doesn't anymore. when the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless. she is unnecessary.the situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesh-t. if a woman was so scared to death of her husband, why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed. wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. at any rate, the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't.then there are the two lovebirds. a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he's making his rounds. i couldn't believe it. i really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. but, what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch. i don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. morose victim and psycho momma. no matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was one constant. the bus driver wasn't going to get any. he even married her without sampling the goods--wtf! then there's the family reunion scene. here we've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos, grinding for the sake of grinding, shirtless, overly musclebound, b-ball, plus the great taste of maya angelou. when those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack. all this crap is going on at the reunion, in laughably easy to separate groups, and then they ring a bell. when they do, everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too, just like a pack of pavlov's doggies--wtf!! then you have the final five minutes of the film. in it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress. there is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling--wtf!!! the only reason to watch it this far, besides testing your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well. guess what, it doesn't happen. instead, perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe, ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness--wtf!! i'm pretty sure that, if given a day , i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks. don't even get me started on the rest of tyler perry's films. i'm just going to say this. in my opinion, as a black guy, d.w. griffith's legacy lives on. the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did, selling us down the river. i only wish perry's films were dudes so i could kick them in the nuts. thanks a lot, dude!! what are you going to follow this up with in 2009, a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in colonial america?

a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. the name of the female assassin is sawa. she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal, akai, who is sleeping with her. one day sawa finds out he killed her parents..------- even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest. "kite" has style, but it is still trash. the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on it's face. one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good/bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful. not only that, the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy.grade: 3/10

well, there's no real plot to speak of, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it's not in this case). what else can i say about this...? the action, when happening, is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there's not much to recommend "kite". watch it if you want, but you're not missing much if you skip this one...

(spoilers)i shoulda figured. the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was. i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen. this one is much worse. makes no sense. thrown together plot. all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them. it had to of been a student film. that musta gotten a c grade2/10quality: 1/10 entertainment: 6/10 (until i found out it wasn't going to end.) the ending made no darn sensereplayable: 0/10

the same night that i watched this i also watched "scary movie 4," making for one messed up double feature. unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise. while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud. how could i desire any more than that. director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers. but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day. the script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea. i, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato. and that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here. some may giggle, i did not. they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny, and i thought all hitler jokes were funny.the narrative of this film is so splintered (for no good reason) that it is nearly impossible to explain. tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia (three things that still control our lives today). oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really don't make much of an appearance. and when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes. that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks. there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny. the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here. man eats tomato and that's dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe. but that is just the way the world works. in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce (see: taco bell) becomes evil thanks to neglect. and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago. there are a few good chuckles to be had. the last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb. i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept, but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there. and by "there" i mean to the level of "scary movie 4." **1/4

with a title like "attack of the killer tomatoes!", anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. it's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody splashed in. unfortunately, it falls flat very soon.you're never supposed to take this movie seriously, i realize that, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (i.e, the side-by-side phone conversations, the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal, superman walking by lois, etc.). "attack of the killer tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't make it. a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "attack of the killer tomatoes" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film.there is one good actress in the entire thing: sharon taylor as lois fairchild. she is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to overact, and is a natural comedienne. unfortunately, she is put to bad use here."attack of the killer tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, "amazon women on the moon" or "kentucky fried movie", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so i would still recommend seeing it once. avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly "lost" footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect (it can be found in english on the out of print tape).

the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume: "can somebody please pass the ketchup?" i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative; it works better than an overdose of demarol.

never see this movie.it tries to be a spoof on scifi/thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it.it is very lame. a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it. this movie does not have any such aspect.save yourself. it's too late for me but... just don't watch it.

"attack of the killer tomatoes" consists mostly of rambling, poorly assembled footage in search of a movie. the plot makes no sense, and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all. watching this silly spoof, you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately: that it's easy to make a cheap, low-quality film and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (in one scene, female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them; how far can "suspension of disbelief" go - even in a parody?). the title song is great, though. (*1/2)

this movie's heart was in the right place, no matter where its brain was."attack" is basically a spoof a la "airplane!" (two years before the fact - nice going.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack.through all manner of film magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball-sized tomatoes at the on-screen actors), the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp. then, it's up to mason dixon (miller) and a group of spies i wouldn't wish on any government's side to save the day. of course there's a meddling reporter (taylor) who pops in at the worst times, dancing and singing army soldiers, japanese scientists with dubbed-in voices, some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword...and oh yeah, the san diego chicken before he made it big.the gags here aren't all that great. in fact, you could probably make up better yourself after watching these. some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ("please pass the ketchup" - not something to say in front of tomatoes.) and as far as "puberty love" goes...well, i can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.what's good about it? well, i liked the theme song and the beginning credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed. ...that's about it.three stars. not a "killer" comedy, but it tries.rock on, peace.

attack of the killer tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. the (very meager) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly. basically,they spin and growl (yes,they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. the actors are no-names who never made movies after this,so there would be no point to name them. there's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes. he's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government. if this isn't making much sense to you, you understand. this movie never would have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. the movie is horribly cheezy, which although being the whole point,really really hurts what could've been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. at one point, a giant wax tomato "slides" on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! maybe i would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value, but even this is lacking from this terrible movie. 2/10

i knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so i went into it with that expectation. i just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring. the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality. seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise. it could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch maybe, but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination.

awlright, damn it, the moocow will grudgingly admit the truth: i kinda' like this cheap, cheesy 70's parody. the idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the us is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large, obviously fake tomatoes. this film, along with the kentucky fried moovie, is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 80's & 90's, thanks largely to airplane!. this one, like moost spoofs, is pretty poor. many attempts at humor are dismal failures, and will induce much groaning. but thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes, the obnoxious "puberty love" song, and the awesome helicopter crash scene, attack of the killer tomatoes does provide some goods, though largely for the wrong reasons. there are sooooo many things wrong with this film...and so right, it's hard to explain. enough people must also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films, and a cartoon series!! large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull. and dig those 70's clothes, dude!! ;=8) this tomato is seedy and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; the moocow says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes!! :

yes, it can be done. john de bello and costa dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , sc-fi musical. if there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. every cheap cliché thought of is used. no doubt a fun movie to watch. worth a cold six-pack or two. point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. san diego is a good place as any to start. scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. this cult favorite features: david miller, eric christmas, al sklar, tom coleman, sharon taylor and john qualls.

i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. however, i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy. other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. however, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made a full movie, and a rather weak one at that.

when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it, i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.led by detective dick mason, a special team of military and scientists (including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt. finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind) 'attack of the killer tomatoes' is a parody of b-movies, in particular japanese horror of the 1950's. the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses! to be fair there are a couple of funny moments, for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent, or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey, can somebody please pass the ketchup?'. equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. unfortunately for 'attack of the killer tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'airplane' and 'naked gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.the acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy. for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre, even for this film. ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult one; i can't see many people being indifferent to it. unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up.

in case you're a self-acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie-making, there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch "attack of the killer tomatoes". it's an inescapable certainty, as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made. one tiny but essential detail, however, is that "attack of the killer tomatoes" is deliberately awful. right from the opening message already, mocking alfred hitchcock's "the birds", this is clearly intended as a zero-budgeted parody and i can't escape the impression that writer/director john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit. the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so-called "eco-horror" movies (plants, animals and nature in general revolting against humanity) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines. a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato-attacks coming from all over the country. the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy, which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices. the first half hour of "attack of the killer tomatoes" is very entertaining. as silly as it is, the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny. the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song, the "jaws" homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash (see the trivia section for more details) that made it to the final cut. after that, however, the whole thing turns into a tedious, unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess. the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots. personally, i prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels (which i saw before seeing the original) because they benefit from slightly better production values, incredibly over-the-top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin ("the addams family") as the mad scientist dr. gangreen. but, as said before already, the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life.

the easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. the target of the satire is quite vast, from the us government to corporate america. it is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.think of this movie as a mix between the kentucky fried movie, airplane and police squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. i can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's. i see this movie as a big influence on tim burton's mars attacks.the plot is simple enough. genetically engineered giant tomatoes go "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. at first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.the movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : lois "fairchild" (a lois lane clone), a very ambitious presidential press secretary, clark kent, mason dixon (fia agent who hasn't worked since the bay of pigs), a useless president (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack new york), an even inept congress, a sleazy marketing ceo, and mason's team consisting of an obese east german "female" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed wwii paratrooper and an african-american disguise expert (disguised as george washington, abraham lincoln, hitler and finally as a tomato). did i also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? there are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.on top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. they aren't that good and seem to be dubbed. the best tune is by far the theme of the movie ("attack of the killer tomatoes"). it is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. be warned.most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres. i don't believe i was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. i definitely recommend this movie for fans of b and c grade movies, but only as a rental.-celluloid rehab

there aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough `coming out' movies. every one is a welcome addition to the genre. although the production values are high(the movie `looks' good, matthias freihof (philipp) looks real good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. it is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(east berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. in a way we're seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here(it often reminded me of `last exit to brooklyn :the book not the film).but it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman. it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didn't hack at random. yes, it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, life behind the `curtain' was hard for gay people. a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses.

the fight scenes play like slow-motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic (worst pun by far: "guess what? this time i heard you coming"). the stars are a mismatched pair: brandon lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that dolph lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). note to the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double. (*1/2)

extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. the action is at best average, a bit of nudity chucked in and yes tia carrera does use a body double! the set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case, the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical, lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. the action sequences are by the numbers and lee(who would go on to make the excellent the crow) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance. but given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies (think cobra etc.) then avoid.poor 3/10

well, i couldn't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values. it's a b-movie action-flick, by the director of "commando", that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b-movie with enough entertainment value in it.it's an '90's flick but foremost the movie should remind of an '80's action movie, when these type of b-movies were at an all time high. these movies always went over-the-top and never paid much attention to its story or acting. it was all about blowing stuff up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn't liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies. hard to say why really, since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era.it's probably because the movie is being often far too silly. all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it. the fighting, dolph lundgren running around shirtless, the characters, the story. it all just isn't very good because it's often just too lame for words. the story at times isn't even trying to make a bit sense and what's even the main plot-line of the overall movie? its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences, gun fights and such. and those sequences aren't even much good to watch really. the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really, from the man who brought us "commando".it's foremost a dolph lundgren, in which he gets to play the big action hero star, who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl, played by tia carrere. this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really. both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together.none of the characters work out really. the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one. they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest, or to inform anyone about their discoveries. not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of l.a. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling. and also just think about it for a moment, what is brandon lee's overall purpose in the movie? the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well.too silly, lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough.4/10

seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. i watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren, and all of the other thrown-in oriental actors, and i found the movie so awful that it was funny. then brandon lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie ever.lungren beats out his previous efforts in "the punisher" and others, as well as all of van damme's movies, seagal's movies, and stallone's non-rocky movies, for this distinct honor. this movie has the absolute worst acting (check out tia carrere's face when she is in any scene with dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (dolph in full japanese attire). picture "tango and cash" with worse acting, meets "commando," meets "friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and lungren's performance is very jason voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.the good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). brandon lee is just there being lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.an awful, awful movie. fear it and avoid it. if you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever. this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity.a bad bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. dolph friggin' lundren with a japanese accent is funny enough, but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and, up till watching "showdown," had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.i don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. there are constant references to male genitalia, and not by females, either. brandon lee and dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact before going on a suicide spree, brandon says to dolphy, "in case we don't make it, i want to tell you, you have the biggest d--- i've ever seen."now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? in an action film no less? and would you want those to be your _dying words_??later, there's this gem:dolph (regarding the villain): "i would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy." brandon: "man, you've got a fixation." as the guy at ruthlessreviews.com pointed out, "unfortunately, dolph doesn't respond with, 'i've got a fixation? i've got a fixation?! you're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates! i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose, man."this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain. it's about on par. great fun for the whole family!

*** warning - this review contains "plot spoilers," though nothing could "spoil" this movie any more than it already is. it really is that bad. ***before i begin, i'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so-incredibly-bad-that-you-fall-over-laughing movies. if you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh, this is the movie for you. now without further ado, my review:this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal-mart. that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is. secondly, it stars the lame action-star dolph lundgren. that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is. i'm still shocked that it was even put on dvd (who would waste their money doing such a thing?), though as you might imagine, there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the dvd. in fact, there's not even a menu; the movie just starts playing.first, the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed. it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one-liners; remarkably unbelievable, fake dialogue; and inappropriate comments (like lee's comment on lundgren's. err. manhood, which i'll mention later). there isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie. the dialogue and plot go hand-in-hand, as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion. the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning, and then for again no reason at all, lee's character pulls over to the side of the road, runs around to the other side of the car, and says `i'm not going to let you go alone, 'cause despite myself, i like you! and i don't want to see you get killed!' . or something to that extent, anyhow. there are disgusting one-liners, mostly said by lee. for instance, when duking it out with a bad guy, lee says `you have the right to remain silent . you have the right to be dead!' lastly, i'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about lundgren's nether-regions. when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and carrere, and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear, lee says to him: `incase we die, i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick i've ever seen on a guy.' . yes, he actually says that. it makes no sense and isn't even possible (lee never actually sees lundgren naked, so how would he know?), but the writer threw it in the script anyway. the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game, and lee even admits it. after lee and the underwear-only lundgren defeat all of those bad guys, lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful: `wow, this is sort of like a video game; we just defeated the first wave!'second, the plot of this movie is despicable. it suffers, in my opinion, mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist. the trailer for this movie - which imdb has available for viewing, by the way - makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese yakuza from taking over lost angeles. this is extremely misleading, however, since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all. they make very brief, vague references to the yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers, but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorly-written attempt for kenner (lundgren's character) to revenge the death of his parents, whom the yakuza leader (named yoshida) killed when he was only 9 years old. the entire plot can basically be summed up like this: yoshida wants kenner dead, kenner wants yoshida dead, and the two try two kill each other. and of course all the while kenner's sarcastic sidekick (named johnny and played by brandon lee) acts like an ignorant idiot, and tia carrere gets naked. twice.the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie. the dialogue is so unrealistic, and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more. you'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway, but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.finally we get to the heart of the movie's baseness: the flagrantly bad action. there are so many astoundingly bad, unrealistic action sequences in this movie, it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in. although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well, most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren. for instance, lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one-handed, without spilling his tea. then, when surprised by an oncoming speeding car, lundgren casually leaps over it. or how about when he reaches through a closed door, grabs the villain on the other side, pulls him back through the door, and beats him up? or when he picks up tia carrere, gently walks (not runs) backward through a glass door that shatters around him, and leaps down a one-story height with tia still in arm, only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets? all of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well, with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy instantaneously, while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them. that is, of course, until the final fight scene of the movie. lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart, would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds. despite this, lundgren remains in top-notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with yoshida, the evil super villain. and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real, fully sharpened katanas, which the two use to sword fight. now in addition to his bullet wound, lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms. does this stop him? no, of course not! in fact, a few seconds later after easily killing the evil yoshida (who gets pinned to a dartboard-like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason), lundgren casually walks off with tia and lee as if he wasn't injured at all. god, it's terrible.all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary, gratuitous nude scene every five minutes, including topless women at a party, the beheading of a topless woman, women at a strip club, nude women at a japanese spa, and the pointless hot tub and love scene with tia. not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar, at which rich japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women. which, by the way, prompts lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and lundgren will `go eat fish off those naked chicks!' which, of course, is followed by a disturbing high five. and we can't forget the terrible editing either, like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard, and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy. the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers, which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all.in the end, this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness. it is illogical and impossible, and as a result, remarkably entertaining. if you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema, this movie will make you want to die. if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making, this movie will delight you. as an actual movie, i'll merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10. as an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes, however, this beauty takes the cake.

i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable, i can see why it hasn't been rebroadcast anytime recently. more specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as:1) it is terribly miscast. the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. ali mcgraw (45 at the time) was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26. jan-michael vincent (39 at the time) was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22. the other henry children, and pamela tudsbury, were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.2) some of the acting was absolutely awful. ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable. i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays. 3) the directing was poor. to be fair to ali mcgraw, the bad acting and character development were probably the directing. the portrayal of hitler was way overdone. his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel. some of the other characters are done so stereotypically (berel jastrow) they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them.4) this mini is very dated. the hokey music, the pretentious narration (it sounded like a junior high school history film narration), and the entire prime-time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times. also, too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all, because it will come off more as a late 70's / early 80's "take myself too seriously" prime-time soap drama, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic.remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning, memorable, and critically acclaimed production. i don't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public, it wouldn't fly.

the beginning of the 90s brought many "quirky" and "off-beat" independent films, a particular sub-genre of which is the semi-spiritual desert crime movie. others of note are "wild at heart", "from dusk til dawn", and to a certain extent "natural born killers". good films like those spawned junk like "highway 666", "destiny turns on the radio" and this ineptly surreal anti-masterpiece "under the hula moon". it's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone, attains it, but keeps going to the point of irritation. while the pursuit across the spirit-world of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and isn't focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy. i won't blow the ending, but let's just say it's bad. the film is basically a bad side effect of genre-cancer. this is the dregs of indie-mania.

so far nightmares and dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. the first segment, directed by brian henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by william hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.however, the second story in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. the screenplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. the acting is overdone and unconvincing, and i felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. the director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of plot or tension.if the rest of the series continues like this, i'll be sorely let down. i look forward to william h. macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. so far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way.

with its companion piece masters of horror, nightmares and dreamscapes can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with the twilight zone and the outer limits.of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience, instead aiming at ten-year-olds, who are only able to count body-bags, and scarcely that. and so grossness is king, and king is grossness.stephen king is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of bart simpson. since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies.true, the cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it has generally escaped the onslaught of "realism". but these films are only the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to write, you have to dig deeper.of course, only pickman had monsters as close acquaintances. but even so, it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not dracula and lugosi.at least autopsy room four is a clear indication of what is wrong. one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scary.not, mind you, trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part, making the stupid stupider, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. suppose, you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things! wouldn't that be gross? and that, boys and girls, is the story.what about characterization? oh yes, he's one of these suits, who never really appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? and he's shouting  well, they can't actually hear him, you know  he's saying that he's going to sue the hospital, but he's not such a big shot anymore, you see, lying there (or is it laying, i can never remember) and all. and he's thinking: oh no please, please don't cut me and this is terrible, lying (or laying) like that  now, wouldn't that be a great story? you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie. what was the name of that snake again, oh yeah, a boomslang  has quite a ring to it, doesn't it.let's make it a peruvian boomslang! sure, steve, that's great  except that boomslang is afrikaans, you moron! but how can you really tell that the target audience is children, and not simply mental defects? it's easy: there's no sex.well, there is, but it's the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent's bedroom. modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase.but unlike universal and lewton they have no idea what's going on. all that's really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil.in spite of a certain discrepancy in size, king kong knew exactly what to do with fay wray. freddy krueger can only kill her.and since there's no real titillation in that, he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her, you understand, since that would upset our puritan sentiments. and so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths.our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves (giggle). and that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they discover that he is, in fact, you know.obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers. too bad, they cut it out, since it might have upset the five-year-olds watching the show!

i've barely just made it through one episode ("crouch end"). the dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy. the acting was tragic. eion bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. his eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. claire forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. the characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random, meandering plot. cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget. but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. if i had to compare it's overall quality to something else, i'd put this episode of "nightmares and dreamscapes" on par with the nbc's hercules.

i just saw the third week of stephen kings' nightmares and dreamscapes mini series; meaning, i saw 6 episodes so far. i have to say that the stories are really weak. i have read stephen king's skeleton crew, a collection of his short stories that was published way back. i recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent, if not outstanding.what i'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from stephen king does not mean that it will be any good. in fact, if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication, then most of this mini series will be average to poor.in stephen king's defense, i have not read these new short stories. perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television, or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script. who knows. also, these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose. maybe that may have been the problem. if stephen king had submitted these crap stories to an editor, i am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is, it is simply boring.what is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories/script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it.seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old "twilight zone" series. each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting. i don't understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat. i am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately, something must not have clicked.for instance, this week there were two episodes shown. the first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide. the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward. feeling uncomfortable, he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him. also, the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him. (i will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode!)this premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it, i was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story. after the last scene, i was left with more questions than answers.i tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories/script. if this was a movie, i would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. i would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. however, given that this is on tnt, a cable channel, i would say if you have not seen it already, then try it for one week. if you do not like it that week, then you will not like the past series nor the future ones, since they all share the same boring trait.

i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers.i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché, it wasn't even funny any more. the same old stories you've probably seen/read a couple of times already - living toys, evil things from other dimensions... and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés. i'd prefer e.g. "chucky" and "silent hill" over those two episodes anytime. and don't even ask about the visual effects... the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second... awful. looks like some film student's project gone wrong. blood... or gore... erm... nothing worth mentioning.it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen/read that many scary stories yet (although i'd rather recommend "beyond belief" - now that's what i call a decent mystery tv show). but for an adult horror fan this is worthless. i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.

man, i really wanted to like these shows. i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these "opportunites". but, sadly, i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king. as brilliant as king's writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn't translate well to the screen, big or small. with few exceptions (very few), the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. many people would disagree with this, but i'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read. the reason is simple. the average king story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. in short, king takes the reader places where you can't put a panavision camera. as an audience watching the filmed king, we're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. it's not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read, whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. for as long as king writes, hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. i don't blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works. the task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane zen mastery. oh well, better luck next time.

the first episode set the bar quite high i thought. it starred william hurt as a hit-man who is contracted to kill a toymaker. we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill, indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all. returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers, this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business. but he is in for a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war, driving jeeps, shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters!. the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive, sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not. i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist. this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment, the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one. stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception

dull demi, going thru the motions. ditto prochnow. ominous portents that elicit yawns. michael biehn trying to be dynamic, which ain't his shtick.to quote buffy summers, "if the apocalypse comes...beep me."going back to sleep now.

the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level. by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ. somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer. the lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer. in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god. the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well. he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self. meanwhile, with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty. i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer. it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment. silly

one word boring.the young demi looks good, but she's pregnant (- point for that =d) the movie is not scary at all...the first scenes looked little crappy, i could render better clouds with my laptop, and after effects. but that was then... and now is now. some movies do not get old well... this is one of them.not worth renting or buying... get something better instead like the exorcist, ...next =doh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor =d

when i saw this film on fearnet, i thought it would be a scary movie. apparently, it wasn't. i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site. fearnet is a site that shows scary horror movies.the acting is wonderful from all the actors. i hated the story. the story was stupid. the movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it. he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. the water turns to blood, the oceans die out, the moon turns red, etc. the female character was annoying as well. a lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense. like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. coincidentally, it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means.*spoiler alert* the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where demi moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it.here's what happens. the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. demi moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. she touches her child's head, transferring her soul into the child and then dies. then, the apocalypse stops.why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart? he gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby? *end spoiler* the movie is pretty stupid. it's another religious end of the world propaganda piece. the acting from demi moore and michael biehn and everybody else is excellent. that's about all there is.i give this movie 2 stars out of 10. good acting with a lot of nonsense!

"the seventh sign" borrows a lot from "rosemary's baby" and "the omen" (it actually blends the two stories).even its title recalls bergman' s "the seventh seal" .nevertheless,it begins well enough,with all the omens scattered on the whole earth,and in parallel ,a -seemingly- distinct plot with moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister)from death penalty.this time,both christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the wandering jew is involved),which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny (have you ever been to sunday school? but they taught me that god was love!).the best scene imho ,is the short dialog between priest john heard -who does not seem to take things seriously ,too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid-back acting is priceless-and the young jew.demi moore probably registered the same desire as ex-husband bruce willis :saving the world.she does not save the movie for all that.

it's official, folks -- hou hsiao-hsien doesn't have a thought in his pretty little head. are you wondering why he chose shu qi as his muse?shu ( or is that qi? ) doesn't appear in this one. instead we get a snaggletoothed yo hitoto, apparently a pop star in japan -- judging by her song at the end, she's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at rockin' curry is "a actriss" -- and a wasted tadanobu asano, typically an indicator of quality, who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling asian hipster and is too old to manage even that. hou's philosophy? life is limbo, a big nothing, feel it and move on. i'd like to do that but hou gives us nothing to feel in cafe lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of life in tokyo circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night, no, make that trains that pass in the day, never connecting, each hurtling to its own destination, usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they're lucky. yikes. flowers of shanghai is one of the most rarefied, technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time. how could the same director who created the opening shot of that film, which features about twelve actors conversing at machine-gun speed for about ten straight minutes -- an impossible directorial feat -- get trapped making this laconic sub-jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now? millennium mambo may be dead weight, but at least it has two great shots, shots that hint at hou's true calling as the film equivalent of odilon redon: those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of shu qi floating down a blue corridor. his m.o. while making cafe lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from millennium mambo to make it more consistent. you be the judge if that sounds appealing. hou does not need to refine -- you cannot refine the limbo idea further than flowers of shanghai. he needs to expand, to bloat outwards, to release the inner expressionist and genre-revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichéd minimalism. it's time for him to do a live-action remake of akira or something. this kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long-shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe, ghettoized and stagnant as the hollywood action blockbuster. ( what is the connection between "reality" and people who can't talk? it seems to me that people "in real life" never stop jabbering. ) then again, considering that 2005 alone brought big-budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as aeon flux, the island, and king kong, it's now safe to say that even michael bay has surpassed hou, and that's really sad.the good news is that, though hou is in his 50s, it frankly feels to me as if he hasn't even begun. there are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there, such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset-red while hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins. but whatever fear is holding him back, however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema, hou, your time as the darling of the rotterdam, venice, toronto, berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double-quick. two words for you: atom egoyan. two more words, or maybe three: tsai ming-liang. you are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever. risk your shirt on a sci-fi epic, sell out, be reviled -- but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart. let your painterly talent express itself to the full. you're not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise.

cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity. unacquainted with the work of the director, i am well-acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to - ozu yasujiro. while not even approaching ozu in greatness, hou has communicated nothing of ozu's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. one of the things he misses entirely is ozu's attention to character - we are not even "introduced" by hou to his lead character (a perfect blank page). there are no medium or close shots of his people. one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou doesn't - a good look at their faces.there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada, which translates to something like "nothing ever happens". that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise. all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack. but the clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. unless you're a trainspotter, this film has nothing to recommend it.

i've given 'kôhî jikô' a low score not because it was a bad movie, but because it doesn't do anything worth praising.i've not seen any of hsiao-hsien hou's work before, but for the uninitiated (me included) 'kôhî jikô' is advertised as a homage to yasujiro ozu. (a japanese director whose last film was way, way in 1962) the film is an extremely sparse work...containing very little dialogue, story, music or emotion.yo hitoto plays 'yoko' a jobless, wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a taiwanese composer she likes. tadanobu asano plays her friend, who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains. and that's about all it.we watch as yoko drinks coffee alone...walks around...waits for a train...catches a train...falls asleep on the train. the kind of mundane reality anybody in japan can see on a daily basis. hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life, but without any meaning to these vignettes it's an entirely pointless film to make or watch.

i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu, whose masterfully understated views of japanese life, especially in the post-wwii era, illuminate universal truths. having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's "late spring" and 1953's "tokyo story", i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. it is taiwanese director hou hsiao-hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. among with co-screenwriter t'ien-wen chu, hsiao-hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable.the story concerns yôko, a young japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century taiwanese composer jiang wen-ye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese. after 25 drawn-out minutes of character set-up, she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan. at the same time, yôko's coffeehouse friend hajime, who runs a used bookstore, has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. hsiao-hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. while these techniques are consistent with ozu's style, hsiao-hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics, in particular, yôko's plight seems rather non-committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest. in fact, the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it, which makes the film feel interminable.the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. j-pop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yôko, while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime. the rest of the characters barely register, even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yôko's parents. cinematographer lee ping-bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. hitoto speak-sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits, "hito-shian". the dvd includes an hour long, french-made documentary, "métro lumière", which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiao-hsien's approach to the film. it includes excerpts from ozu's films, in particular, "equinox flower", to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either "tokyo story" or "early summer", the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set-ups. there are also edited interview clips of hitoto, asano and hsiao-hsien, as well as the film's trailer.

while the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit - the storyline is a very poor wannabe vietnam movie with the country name simply changed.at the very least, for a movie to hold some credibility, try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm.aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the south african defence force, it serves little purpose - definitely no entertainment value.aspiring movie makers - this is how not to make a war movie. do some research, and have some pride in your product.

ok this movie was really "unique" shall we say. carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie, even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie. but she said that she can't remember to much of it. well thats her excuse but whats everyone else's??? i can't imagine they all had a coke problem.whatever it wasn't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments. although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste. oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her.

carrie fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she doesn't remember very much of it. that would explain why she made this film, but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did; i can't believe that everybody had a coke problem. this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and that's saying something. the blame can't be laid at the feet of "director" tim kincaid or "writer" buddy giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone. apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop. co-star robert joy has done good work in other films, and composer jimmie haskell and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans, marks also having been a director, and not a bad one. why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. tim kincaid, the alleged "director", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, i can tell you that not a one of them is any good. this one, though, is by far the worst thing he's ever done, and that is a major accomplishment on his part. everything, absolutely everything, about this movie is 12th-rate--at best. the cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the "special effects" make "plan 9 from outer space" look like "spider-man", the story is trite, derivative and stupid. don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, let alone renting it. a complete, utter, annoying, total dud.

this movie should be number one on the bottom 100. the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill. and the story is worse. i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob's review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet. don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. thank goodness we saw it on tv so we didn't spend anything on it. had we, i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction. in conclusion, i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act. but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film. don't spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it.

whoa. in the twin cities, we have a station that shows a "big bad movie" monday through friday. tonight's nugget was a film with carrie fisher called "she's back" about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house. bea (beatrice) comes back to haunt her husband. she wants him to seek revenge on her killers, hence "she's back". and she won't let him rest until he does so. she irritates him endlessly... and the viewers, too! this movie is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen. hey, i like bad movies, though (my fave movie is xanadu). i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film, wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie. bea is just so annoying. the plot is silly; the acting is bad; the story... well, you get my drift. anyway, if you wanna see a really bad movie - really really bad movie, check this one out. you won't be disappointed. heh.

protégé runs in a linear fashion; expect no fast-paced action, and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating-on-the-edge moments.there is not much of a crux, so don't expect one either. i would not fault the acting - the show would have been much worst if not for wu's acting which was the film's only saving grace. and, oh that cute little girl too.the humour is at best, weak, and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign which employs the usual shock-tactic (esp in the scenes with zhang) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e. drugs break up families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean off, you will fall into a vicious cycle.i know it may seem all a little harsh, but i feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy (*spoiler alert*: take for example when andy lau got brought to the police station: what? we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997', and that is how he got caught. nope, no chasing-car action, just a jump-of-scene, which kind of undermined wu's role as an undercover in the first place.) i suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all, a production of mediacorp raintree - a singaporean production film company.

andy lau stars in another cop undercover tale. daniel wu plays nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang(lau). the movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces. we then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near nick and to his cronies and the cops, and 45 minutes in i shut off the movie and put on the news. well acted and great to look at this is as uninvolving a movie as i've seen in a long time. its not bad as such its just you really don't care. i mean i really didn't care at all. i actually started to do something else completely forgetting i had on a subtitled movie on, thats how much i didn't care. i wish i could have hated the film but the film is such a nonentity that it made almost no impression on me (its not even something i could sleep to its just something to ignore). come on the box called it the chinese scarface,what after he was dead? this is one to avoid.

i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid. i snuck downstairs really early one morning, started watching hbo, and the raft (segment 2) terrorized me good. this time around, i still enjoyed the raft, although i couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. the other two segments were complete trash. i can't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk. all i've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory. creepshow 2 will now join rad among my list of tainted childhood classics. 4/10

five years after the original creepshow, another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a. romero and stephen king: creepshow 2. this time there are only three stories instead of five. none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either. the first story is a horror staple, formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. the effects are really neat in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough. george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners. the second story, "the raft", is a stephen king story. it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason. however, instead of being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next. there is also some unintentional humor in this segment. the third and final story is "the hitch-hiker", which is actually a retread re-adapted for creepshow 2. the original story, by lucille fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film. then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens. "the hitch-hiker" works the best out of these three offerings, but it's not without its problems either. lois chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitch-hiker, or so she thinks. however, we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. as in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns. the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place. tom savini appears as the "creep" in this installment. the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels. *1/2 of 4 stars.

sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing, and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition. these three tales aren't anything as good as any from the original creepshow.by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners. the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop, makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it. the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver, but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down.watch the original creepshow instead, or if you already have done then be happy with that.

i am a big fan of old horror movies, and since i am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period. i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being creepshow 1, which i thought was great. i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. all the stories were great though. so why did i like them so much? the characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb.com, lol. when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it's telling you something.....4 of 10. also, romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard (i don't know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. it's shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it.

"creepshow 2" is little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film. it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy-handed. still, the first time around, there were enough thrills to make up for it's periodic lulls, resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort. the sequel has few worthwhile moments, so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent. once in a while, it delivers, but most of the time, it just lingers there.as in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts. a wooden indian comes to life, wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner. teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster. a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist. none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves, but they are utterly lacking in inspiration. there are few surprises and no scares. this a textbook example of unmotivated, by-the-numbers filmmaking. it doesn't help that this cheap-looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style, although to be honest, there wasn't much to work with. in the end, the second story comes off best, but not by much. for the most part, the performances are okay at best. george kennedy, as the ill-fated general store owner, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired job. dorothy lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guilt-ridden motorist, evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable, redundant material. however, most of the characters are pretty thin overall. one would think that "creepshow 2" would have turned out better. george romero, who directed the original, returned to pen the screenplay, based on more of stephen king's stories. makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good, gory work. so why is the film a letdown? i guess romero didn't really want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. it was a decade of horror sequels, clones, rip-offs, and whatnot, so this one was certainly inevitable. i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, picking up his paycheck, and running off. i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed; we can't blame him.rating: *1/2 (out of ****)released by new world pictures

creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, they just didn't put enough time in perfecting it. the stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but it was lacking. it's a good movie, but after you've seen it once, you might want to see it again. this movie could of been better.

creepshow 2 is the ill-fated sequel to the george romero's (overrated) original, creepshow. any sequel following a romero film that's not directed by romero himself has got some large shoes to fill, mostly because of the romero fans out there who think he's god. i didn't care much for the first film and funny enough, i didn't care much for the sequel. the film series had so much potential but it was short-lived because both films were less than stellar. the biggest problem with creepshow 2 was that it only had three stories (excluding the in-between story), and because the first story sucked beyond belief, it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be *really* good. i saw cs 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner. anything dramatic with george 'i can't act' kennedy is automatically doomed and the indian statue story was too hokey and simply didn't belong in this sequel. so after a really trite and dull start, there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories weren't great enough for me to forget the first story. the raft and the hitchhiker are moderately successful, moderately because though the two other segments have their moments, they still sorta fall flat. the two last stories are basically stretched out for too long. it's not that i wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast, but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized, more erratic and with punchier endings. also, if the two last stories hadn't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction, they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch. having only three padded segments made for a boring feast.the acting and writing in both the raft and the hitchhiker segments are from awful to good. i like lois chiles in the last segment. it's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as bond girl holly goodhead in moonraker and in death on the nile. but even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story. are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her? are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker? if the hitchhiker's body was found by other people on the road, what was he when he attacked chiles? was he a ghost or a zombie or what? how did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack chiles? the whole thing is not very clear, even for a supernatural story. and the ending is rather dull and uneventful.as for the infamous the raft story, well, the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting. the characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves. none of the actors are convincing in their specific roles. paul satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut. she seems too timid. the same could be said with the two others who play the "plain" teens. the idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed. there should have been a fifth character to the story, maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monster's alter ego of sorts. as creepy as the oil slick is, it doesn't make for a compelling "character". and the way the story ends, everything seems pointless. no punch to it whatsoever.except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile, seeing creepshow 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time. cs 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen.

i might not be a huge admirer of the original "creepshow", but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection! and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more. five years after its predecessor, george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve king's three stories. though, the direction is handed off to michael gornick. the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick. but most of the blame would have to go to romero's dreadfully static and unbearably cringe-like script (especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story). moralistic messages (that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters) simply took over the black humour. oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture. loosely linking the three tales (old chief woodenhead, the raft and the hitchhiker) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia (80s) animation form. i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light. # the first story "old chief woodenhead" sees two elderly proprietors (george kennedy & dorothy lamour) of a general store in a dying native community, dead river. get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood. in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths. -listen to george kennedy waffle.. and waffle on for 10 minutes about how he's committed to his 'great' community. what a nice touchy feely time. well, just like kennedy's speeches, this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise. the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so. these two factors really added to my headache. when the indian comes alive and turns avenger, the goons meet a very quick (though grisly) death in the proper fashion. the effects were commendably done, but what about that free flowing hair. how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back? ugh! # second story "the raft" follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake. after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water. -now this is much better, much better. what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy set-up that's full of tight and claustrophobic tension. and it doesn't even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter. quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too. the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it. the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark. gornick's direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side. while, the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords. the sludge-like creature in the lake (like many have mentioned) looks like an icky black tarpaulin (yeah you're reading that right!) floating on the water. # finally number three concludes with "the hitchhiker". a wealthy, but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo, but she's is running late. thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed, she skids off the road and accidentally hit's a hitchhiker. instead of checking or getting help, she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband. soon enough she's being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker.-not awful, but i really didn't get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all. compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead. lois chiles was okay in the lead role, but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired. the vivid make-up effects are well-displayed and dripping with vision. when she hit's the hitchhiker that's when it becomes hectic, cheesy and over-the-top in its execution. from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line, "thanks for the ride lady!" this happens every time she decides to run over him. have a little courtesy for the dead darling. in all, the second short story "the raft" and the unpleasantly, well-conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel.

we've all been there, sitting with some friends watching a bad movie, laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says "how is it possible such a movie was made? who paid money to have this script made into a feature film?" well jigsaw is not that kind of film, instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun. yes, jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived, this coming from a guy who has seen campfire stories and fever lake. the film starts out in some kind of college class, what kind of class i am unsure, but it is imagined to be an art class. now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher, five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit, and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic a, oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free a, good for her! a week passes and the five students, plus teacher, plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project, they put the pieces together, head, arms, legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs, now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage, one puts a saw blade in the left hand, the other gets a sawed off shotgun, the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings, the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye, ala hellraiser 3, with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo-hawk. after they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin, now aptly named jigsaw. now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair, bad acting, dialog and everything else, but has still been pretty plausible, yet after jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst...jigsaw comes alive.. how you ask? i have no idea, he just does because the writers couldn't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive (come on guys, a bolt of lighting, a traveling voodoo priest, anything could have worked.) so once jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc. first he kills the cool guy with some barb wire, this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him. with him gone jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head, he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband; jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception. did i mention jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself? no! well its not important they don't even show his macabre creation, they don't even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators (maybe he was trying to create the head detective from in living color). so after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left, the teacher figures out that jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece, since he is still uninterested in that torso thing. so being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn't even plugged in. that is where the freaking movie ends, we don't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl, let alone an explanation why jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned. this movie is so shameful it has too be seen, it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day; for the memories of a lifetime, jigsaw, jigsaw, jigsaw. thank you total recall! the judge has ruled, watch jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out.

ok another film bought by me and joe swatman. ok this isn't the worst film i've reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap.the monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas, u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun, the film wasn't as gory as we hoped, i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack. again i think the acting sucks, sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason. the absolute worst part is the ending, it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw 2 but thats never gunna happen lets face it.my ratings:funny 4/100 mock (how much fun we had mocking it) 73/100 acting 8/100 generally 12/100

whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies. if you like them so god damn awful they're hysterical, watch away. jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie i've seen in my life (and i've seen 'long time dead'), and i say this as a fan of the low-budget horror/gore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to. i'm not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is, the only good thing about it is it's so so terrible it's one of the funniest things i've seen in years. if you can find this to rent cheap it's definitely worth watching, if you were involved in making it - shame on you. :o) imdb need to introduce a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie, it thoroughly deserves it.

i am not sure who is writing theseglowing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks. i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all i could take. plot is terrible, acting is even worse. and there is no development at all.even the david cocteau films are better than this. run away from jigsaw . i expected to hate the acting, which can be forgiven in direct to video movies, if the plot is good.this had no scares, very little gore,and a truly unattractive cast.i watched this with three other friendswho i hope are still talking to me!they wanted me to fling the disc out the window. i can not believe anyone could havegiven this tripe a good review.

i love b movies..but come on....this wasn't even worth a grade...the ending was dumb...b/c there was no real ending!!!..not to mention that it comes to life on its own...i mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers?? slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period...and i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head....and then you don't even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called "new jigsaw puzzle"....unless you have nothing better to do...id watch paint dry before id recommend this god-forsaken movie to anyone else...oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window..that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film

i go to a lot of movies, often i bring my 5 year old son, i am so glad i did not bring him to this one. there are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene, however, that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it. the trailers lead you to believe it is a light-hearted comedy; nevertheless, virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews. i kept waiting for it to get interesting, funny, or anything but serious; however, i nearly fell asleep as the plot-less story dragged on. i understand that dogs can be great company, that being said, the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train. if a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned. the worst movie i've ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson, a waste of their talent. the best way to sum up this movie is, couple gets unruly dog, couple falls in love with dog, dog dies, couple sad. the end.

actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. the actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. there aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.the interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. and the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).ah yes, the virus. i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick i know of, but i can't. a computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? gimme a break. warp drives a la "star trek" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? this is so silly the desired "fright factor" just isn't realizable. the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it. one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues. he needed the money. no other comparison between the two should be construed,however.

gwoemul (the host) - due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal.firstly, i love monster movies: mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening komodo dragons, the whole lot. creature features are my favourite kind of horror film. so, i really wanted to like the host, but it wasn't to be. there were three major problems with it:the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb pagegenre: action / comedy / drama / fantasy / horror / sci-fi / thrillertoo many damned genres. it took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. anti-pollution, anti-american or anti-government). the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles.secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america, apparently, do nothing. and that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. this lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved).and lastly, the film is clumsily political. it paints the americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment. with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the han river. the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. as well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that.on the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising. some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. there are also some nice shots in the film. some of which remind me, strangely, of the way firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).there is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. it's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.overall, i was really disappointed by this film. i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead i get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated. just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years (the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. for once i'm in favour of a remake. tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. as it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.

what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster movie ever." let's start with the good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. from the get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. the opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. the pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. with in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. in this the movie delivers.after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. the monster it's self looks great: alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it's path. when the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. plot-lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. as for the comedy, let me say this: i'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. however, as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years (still here) i'd like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white-guy. that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, weren't. *********** spoiler************* for example: after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. a new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. this competition is, at it's core, funny: two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy. this subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** end spoiler **************then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment to that nature. instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. so i ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. not in this movie. instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.again, i'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' maybe its in korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page, but never finishes one. maybe it's ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.

i really, really didn't expect this type of a film outside of america. how anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a "thriller" is just sick. auteuil (whom i had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.what's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film "happiness" came out the year before this film. menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. it's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. they were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch "happiness" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? hmm...i wonder. if they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button-pushing crap. 1/10

despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright; much better than i expected it to be. i was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. but in the end, i thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).the cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. i couldn't help thinking, though, that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look-a-like. maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.while it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard, 'fatal error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.

i am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out. we personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie. and we really tried to stick with it. in particular, those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all. :(that said, it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers. that's the beauty of the subjective art form of film. :)

i really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that (i'm not even kidding)half walked out. shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story, the film utilizes david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting. the performances in this film are so dull and bored that i figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script. what's worse is that it's colored like an episode of miami vice. i don't know who this director thinks he is; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like bunuel, jordowsky, etc. but the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. i could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago, but when we've got masterpieces such as bad eduction, mysterious skin and show me love why bother with this cinematic turd? there is nothing new to be seen here.

as a lesbian, i am always on the lookout for films relating to gays & lesbians. however, with this kind of crap out there--it would be enough to discourage any audience.i kept waiting for something to happen--anything!--a story to develop, or just for it to make some kind of sense. neither occurred. it was just meaningless scenes, unconnected in any way with anything. the film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the character.after an hour or more of this nonsense, i simply turned it off.don't waste your time on this absurdity.1 star - and it doesn't even deserve that.

one would think that a film about a young person's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring. think again. this production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it's about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market. it's almost as if the film maker *considered* making a movie, but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random (and randomly boring) images and go-nowhere scenes, throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting, pretend that good lighting ins't important in the film-making process, and wrap it up under the auspices of an "arthouse" film. this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film-makers to poo-poo the indie film movement, and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films.if you're interested in films covering this subject matter, you'd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logo's website or renting get real. better yet, read stone butch blues. whatever you do, skip this long-winded piece of dreck.

"wild tigers i have known." it will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. it is one of those films so artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director! i hate those! and all of those oh-so-alternative/artsy people try desperately to find "metaphors" in what is evident horseshit.there was no plot, no story, no moral, no chronology, and nothing amusing or even touching. to me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another, and were all for "show" to show how "artsy" and "visual" they could get. it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. then the credits roll! i was waiting for it to make sense! i was waiting for "the good part." i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection, many of which could arguably be called "art house" films. this will not be amongst them. you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film, much less ever buying it on dvd.

about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end... i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel... alas...those who like gus van sant's films - especially his later ones - will probably like this. personally, i find van sant's films to be dull, pretentious and facile. well, he was an executive producer for this film, so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally i actually liked this better than van sant's latest efforts (e.g. elephant).contrary to many here, i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed, i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all. but i feel that the problem with the film is that "mood" is not enough... and not only that, but that the mood painted here is, to my mind, incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening. the dream-like quality, so closely linked to nature, is beautifully captured here, but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child, one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold (waves on a beach, grasses and flowers, spiders etc). the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine. there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life. when you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything but languorous! there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film...spoilers here - first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit. the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.the second, and only part of the film with any tension to it, were the scenes where "leah" (logan's re-creation of himself) phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone-sex. the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of "leah" was the most convincing actor in the entire film. (it made me think of claire danes from my so-called life ...the voice even sounded like claire.) she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids. and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally! - we got some character development.all in all, a somewhat misplaced effort... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director's possible talents. in the meantime, if he can get away from van sant's influence, it might do him a world of good. who is this director anyhow - one of van sant's boy toys?

first of all, this film is glacially slow-moving, and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes.the film's subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film; what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes.it's unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer like (say) lanford wilson, i think symbolism like a mountain-lion invading a school campus could take on great, tragic proportions without being heavy-handed.i think, with a good script supporting the film, the same filmmaker, with the same tastes, and even with the same actors (who didn't really even get a chance to impress me), might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful "crush" on an older boy that he admires.however, i'm sorry to say that without this foundation, and armed with a vague, dull-witted, and vastly uninteresting script, without any sort of plot in sight, and lacking any sort of sensible structure (for example, after viewing it, i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes, and instead, will find yourself enumerating "well, maybe that scene, or that one, were climaxes...")--the result is 95 minutes of tedium.without a good plot, we never get terribly interested in any of the characters; their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring.without a good plot, dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the story-line. i never really could believe, for example, the creation of "leah" and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed.as the film stands, i'm afraid it's one i cannot recommend at all. what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn't re-made by an enterprising film-maker...instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release! all it needs is a good script, written by good writers, and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male coming-of-age that is rarely treated in drama. all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film (the messages written on the boy's belly, the "leah" scenes, the television-screen fantasies) could become rich if underpinned with a good storyline.i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a "gay" subject, and i think that's mistaken. obviously, the "crush" depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy, but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices, and, indeed, in his depicted masturbation fantasies, we see all sorts of stimuli, sexual and non-sexual, as we would expect in a very young boy like him. i believe "crushes" such as logan's are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sex-partners.

i haven't actually finished the film. you may say that in this case i have no right to review it, especially so negatively. but i do, only because i stopped it on account of i couldn't watch anymore...i got over halfway, and i only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. this film is so tiresome, so lackluster that i was actually insulted. i haven't read many of the other reviews, so i'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but i am homosexual, and i did go through "similar" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. there were maybe two moments where i actually felt this film could go somewhere, where i felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narration came on. i mean, just look at the quotes on the imdb page. unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. i did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform archer's tired "concepts" into something watchable. mind you, i pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of tv closeups...another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as korine's gummo... i think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at sundance (only because archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as "arthouse". no, it's not art house, i'm afraid it's just plain s**t-house. do not watch.

wow, i hated this movie. the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic, but the script - if there even *was* a script - is a mess. this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere. i'd say it goes nowhere fast, except that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit through. as i've mentioned, the lead actor is good. so is faruza baulk (sp?), as his sometimes-harsh-but-ultimately-loving-and-accepting mother. the film makers have a lot to answer for here, because this is a mess. a real shame,because i really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically out-takes from a movie that never got made. skip this one - it wasn't even worth the $6 i shelled out for pay-per-view.

i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly. i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful. it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great, or i wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day. i like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. those that walked out, as i considered doing after about three minutes, probably didn't mind shelling out $11.00, or just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are..either that or they didn't pay to get in in the first place.logan is bored. he's a klutz. he's gay. i'm okay with that. the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also! there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry, re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc...nothing or no one goes anywhere. no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. probably most appalling of all is that i didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan. that in itself is a major accomplishment. he didn't grow, he didn't change, he didn't learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he didn't do anything, and neither did the movie! scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make.additionally, the title makes no sense at all. 1/10.

like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. in the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, i imagine... the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and i would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes. oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and i was reluctant to get up and take a break.

had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution. how do these people get through film school? who gives them money to make this crap? could have been so much more, fine lead actor, and i always like fairuza balk, but come on, the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired, and it sure doesn't make for good films. the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making, just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges. that can work, if the director actually has any kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential, but here it's just space filler, of no consequence. i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit, and was yelling "you lazy bastard" at the screen when the credits popped up.

visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore-fest. the moments that work in this film are very limited, and the characters don't even feel real. how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? substantively and stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. it added no meaning, just cheese, and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is a close call). what a flop.

i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie. they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot. besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child-porn (which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically, i would liken this movie to a recipe that's been torn in half. it's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients, with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product. from the start, character development and story development are lacking...unfortunately, many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think "ahh-ok...finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on...or...who this character is...or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more...or understand and get involved more with this inter-character relationship...etc." but no such luck! on the contrary, many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled, only to find that whatever mini-plot within whatever mini-plot (and that poorly presented) was just a ruse. why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery, other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2-1/2 stars (another mystery). it's not that the characters aren't likable to some degree, or that you can't identify with them or their humanness at all...it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort. i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone's film school project. i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.

after watching this movie on dvd, i watched the trailer. the voice-over describes the movie as surreal. well, there's surreal, and there's surreal. there was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. the other unusual imagery, particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor, were so nonsensical they had no meaning. i don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.my impression is that the director was trying to convey logan's inner monologue. i don't know what else would explain what was going on. unfortunately, nothing i saw gave me any clue what logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. all i could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy. i thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did. purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. still, as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace. i very much liked madagascar skin, and i had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative, and perhaps even style. it didn't even come close. for me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an a for effort, but a d for execution.

sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor ("on the wings of love"), i knew i would be in for an "interesting" time. i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing; watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so. i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing, though its quality and morality are often lacking."on the wings of love" details the journey taken by jake, a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas, texas, to find true love, as true a love as one can find in a season-long reality-drama dating show. jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. he begins to get to know them a bit, but it is mostly superficial; how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations? jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning, at least to the audience. he noted that he doesn't just want love or a good time, but he wants a fiancé or wife. we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well. if that is the case, it might explain, to a degree, some of the women's actions. the women are super competitive. while they don't even know jake at all yet, they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost.not only were the women competitive, but they were also confident and catty. threats, backstabbing, and warnings of "watch out!" all show that these women weren't there for a good time either. jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal, but looking for "a connection." however, the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal. they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses  either low-cut or short.while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum, others missed that memo altogether. one girl, channy, noted that jake was a "good guy" to whom she could be a "naughty girl." she went on to say that jake could land on her "runway anytime." she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations.so, a reality dating show couldn't be that bad, could it? besides the obvious issue of sex-driven attraction, there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show. is this the right way to find a future mate; vying for someone's attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions? unfortunately, however, that is what america has reduced dating to these days: pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side.another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake. a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached. one girl said "if i don't get that first impression rose it will kill me!" as mentioned before, they don't even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose, not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated.michelle, in particular, seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake. the other girls noticed it too. after one particular michelle outburst, vienna asserted that michelle had a "mental breakdown and we've only been here an hour." michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show  narrowly missing elimination  and was extremely emotional about it. the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous. another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated.it began with survivor, and from there it just took off  reality tv. it shows our entertainment interests as a country; if we weren't watching the shows and giving them good ratings, the networks would not continue to run them. the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked. one thing is clear: america (in general) loves reality tv and its ensuing trappings.this begs me to question: why is it that we even like reality tv? what is it about it that draws us to it? is it because we see the similarities to our own lives, or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? whatever it is that draws us to it, we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. i'm not saying that all reality tv shows are bad; however, i am saying that we need to evaluate each one.episodes used for critique: season premier and episode 2.

yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice, this show is pretty bad. i didn't mind the first couple of shows, but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place.the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.ryan, you can have trista. she had the most annoying voice i've ever heard on television, and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around (very media savvy, but i doubt there's much more there).i haven't really watched any of the shows since, apart from the occastional re-run on daytime tv. i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as "entertaining trash". view it as something you can laugh over, and don't have to think too hard about ( i don't watch csi its like reality tv-tired and clichéd, but you have to think too much anyway while watching).a couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show. at the very first 'the woman tell all" woman such as amy ( who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her. hey amy, how about joining a club? getting a hobby? doing charity work? changing your job to one where you meet more guys? gees, all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting "the perfect man'. clue to ladies: he doesn't exist. there are, however, many great guys out there that would make great husbands, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six figures a year or be a jfk junior look alike, but they are great guys all the same. the shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable. im still a youngster, at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. this show is proving otherwise.overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society. it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made. the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun. nothing is manned more between the "couples" than a simple night out. the bachelor, sadly takes itself way too seriously.

it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air. there's been one couple that has stayed together, married, and has children, but everyone else has broken up. what's the point of continuing this? the show can be entertaining at the beginning. you see all the girls swooning over one man, that almost all of them like instantly. it's just like in real life! the girls start to take sides, bitch one another out, and show their true selves (or so we think). but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after.what is true love exactly? how can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them? this show is unbelievable. you thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on tv to find love? it's not realistic. how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others, making out with them? none of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there won't be a happy ending in the future. for all we know, everything is scripted.

i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption.although it's been years since i read the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous. very important elements, which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad.if the plot sounds interesting to you: go and get the novel. its much, much, much better.still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich.

i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. judge for yourself. be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.a computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. when the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. this virus is very intelligent. when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage, which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm. fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.oh dear...

robert wagner is the evil boss of digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system' 'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time''but it's not going after software, it's killing people'watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard

this has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. will be used in the 9th circle of hell at recreation time. just plain torture.i would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. horrible. horrible. horrible.you know, the good thing about swiss cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's only holes - and the excitement factor? well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an olympic speed sport.my brain hurts from trying to work out who ok'd this drivel, did they think about the premise? (i sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. made for tv should not be a synonym for: "sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! our audience are idiots!"i was hooked just to know how it could get any worse. this is not a good sign, folks. hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.i should be ashamed for watching it.i am ashamed. i'm off for a long shower.

i didn't expect much from this tv movie. you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr. still, it managed to disappoint, failing even to be a good-bad film.every scene was by rote, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, leaned back and said, "my work is done". it's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).do yourself a favor. watch "the x-files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. they handle it better. also, let anyone know that sitting through "fatal error" is just that.

extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel.what was even worse was marlon brando's performance. his southern drawl was ridiculous. i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. tyrone power, in "witness for the prosecution," should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here.the film, dealing with racism, dealt with the u.s. government's attempt to avoid marriages between u.s. soldiers and japanese women.brando was stone-faced throughout the movie. his moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman. his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances. nothing about either performance was equally impressive. umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka, who did nicely as brando's love interest. she showed great emotion as the anti-american who found love with the brando character. her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11. she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in "the ten commandments" to the bigoted mother of brando's love interest at first. her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted. patricia owens, as brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.

one of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible. i would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended. but i'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisis.it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand. they're getting close to earth, so much so that it's become unseasonably hot, as if the entire earth were death valley. the answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing it's not in direct alignment with the earth. who to deliver it, but captain tim matheson and his crew. that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son, corin nemec. taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston, matheson's father, and nemec's grandfather.there's a villain here too, peter boyle who is the ceo of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors. the idea he might not survive doesn't enter into his thinking. he's doing his best to sabotage matheson's mission.solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea. boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman, apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and overacts accordingly.the rest of the cast are stalwart, true blue and dull. except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him. the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films, allen smithee. the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving.

it was one of those late night "it's there" i saw it things. sometimes they are great. this one was awful, but it really shouldn't have been.the movie had a really good cast. how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance? we're talking oscar winner turf here. it had good special effects. it even had some really good tits! and i mean nicely shown, full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver. but it didn't compensate for the one missing ingredient - a story! the plot was ludicrous. i don't mean the "solar crisis" sun exploding stuff, but that was bad enough. it was the rest of the stuff - the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff. man that just stank! no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one.i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good. i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets. all the difference is in the writing.

disowned by richard c. sarafian, this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video, where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am-6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin. the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it. but i'm afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one. the actors, mostly recent graduates of "overacting 101", deliver one cornball line after another. the plot is convoluted. the special effects are unimpressive. the parts that aren't laughable are just plain boring. the script or the book must have been good - why else would palance, matheson, boyle, or heston agree to appear in this dud? but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen. summary: avoid. not even bad enough to be so-bad-it's-good.

i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive dvd/video/laserdisc collection, so luckily i didn't personally have to pay for it. i had an inkling that it would be a bad film, but i know what a truly bad film is after watching greats like children shouldn't play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies, and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad.solar crisis is bad, but it doesn't reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at.anyway, the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it. in order to counter-act this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb (which the opening describes as "the biggest explosive ever") into the sun, which through some convoluted sci-fi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle, leaving earth unharmed.never mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek. even with an ensemble cast (charlton heston, peter boyle, and jack palance), solar crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity, thanks to a plot that starts simple, yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on.the crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character (played by boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. through means that are never explained, he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crew's genetically engineered scientist, played by female lead annabel schofield. why is he sabotaging the mission? because by his moronic viewpoint, he believes the flare won't happen and that when it doesn't, he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market. in effect, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginable.the film's plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly, in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline. i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention, but i am sitting here writing this review on microsoft word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages, and i would only succeed in losing your interest. but then again, you would probably get the same effect from watching the film.anyway, the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue. imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters spewed sci-fi jargon back and forth at each-other. yes, i know, they already do that, but imagine if that's all they did, and that they used said jargon to set up vague and near-nonsensical scenes that produce no excitement, tension, or interest in the viewer whatsoever.this is best exemplified at the point when a character in a zero-g environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding. the script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion, but doesn't bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs, nor why he can't really escape. in totality, you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable.then we have several scenes where dramatic build-up leads to nothing. jack palance's performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero (don't ask) around the desert, before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits. on his death-bed, palance finally tells our boy hero his last name (while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball), which he kept quiet about before. colonel travis j. richards. the boy repeats it quietly after he expires, giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film. perhaps charlton heston's grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated. something. anything.nope. sorry. any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic, failed attempts at creating dramafor a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on palance's career, just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred.completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villain's spell, a climax which features another of the film's considerably well-done visual effects sequences that, even for the visibly elaborate care put into them, still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is. the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget, tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind boyle, heston, and palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure over-acting.grade: d-

oh the hilarity! oh the joy! another film that is so bad it's good! or, so i thought. in actual fact, this one misses the "so bad its good" phase and goes, sadly, straight to the "could have been so bad its good, but they screwed it up and made it plain bad".for a start its way too long. cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable. then put in such ludicrous plots as "the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth, because he has all the food stockpiled and he'll be rich if the mission fails!". duh!. or the "talking bomb" plot device last seen in dark star. guess what....just like in dark star, the bomb has a malfunction.....hmmmm. add in a dash of "we can't act our way out of a kindergarten play" and you have solar crisis in a nutshell.light relief is to be had in the form of jack palance (or jack pants, as we called him in this flick), whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kid's dad to come pick him up....eventually. between driving and phoning, jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot, but contributes little to the story, such as it is. in short, he's the best bit of the movie.my award for "the most ironic line delivered straight-faced" goes to charlton heston, who, when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages, comments that his son looks a little "out of shape" whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corset.also amusing is the bad guy's top henchman, who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol, for some reason.apart from these hilarities, there's little to recommend this movie. the ending is a sequence copied from (but mercifully shorter than) the end sequence from 2001.tips for enjoying this movie more, if you are foolish enough to watch it, like i did:1. any time the bomb speaks, imagine it's called tarquin (trust me, it works!)2. whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak, pre-empt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as "get your filthy paws off me!" or similar.3. whenever the female lead is looking stressed (this is most of the time) keep hoping against hope that she's having an aneurism and will die soon.4. during the interminable "the ship's broke again" scenes, keep hoping the tech/engineer guys will spout a scotty-ism like "you cannae change the laws of physics!" or some such crap.other than that, do what it takes to get you through this one. i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadn't missed anything, nor had the plot (laughable though it is) advanced any. so don't worry about tuning out for a few, you won't miss anything.

when i had first heard of "solar crisis" then got a load of the cast, i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. then i saw it.now i know.for a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back.and the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. but other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency.don't get me started about the cast. what heston, palance, matheson, boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess. makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in hollywood....and as far as the end goes.... well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this. if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, maybe i would have heard of "solar crisis" sooner.two stars. mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this?

the movie lacks credence with the helicopters which didn't exist until the 1950s. but no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. about the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that germany would want to know where the landing would be. ignore for the moment that the british had captured all the spies but even if they had not, they wouldn't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the germans that the landing would be at calais. it isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work. it is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail. bad directing, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (at all) all combine to just make the movie fall flat. generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork. the suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected. on this one that game was over from the start. this spy was doing anything but spying. your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book.

to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director. you need at least one of the two. in this eye of the needle we have none.i don't even remember the name of the director. he mustn't have done much in his career. i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie. he falls short. sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes. i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in jfk of oliver stone when he talked to kevin costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non-stop without even taking a breath. wonderful. but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good.kate nelligan? she is probably good for tv series. the dvd is awful. terrible colors. terrible light. i couldn't even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was.this ken follett story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie.

i don't know what it is about donald sutherland's acting style, or vocal style, but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex. he's just...i don't know, thick? somnambulistic? on meds? weird.that said, i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, i don't remember it ending anything like that. a bad ending, too, because nothing gets tied off. what about the dead husband? the annoying child (and was the kid dubbed?)? the scotland yard and military pursuers? i would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all, not just the big panoramic pull-away.and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband? even if she was trying to allay needle's suspicions to protect her kid, she could always have had a headache. that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable...

i was expecting a little something from "k-911", i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into. i always did love the dog comedy movies. but it looked like it was supposed to be jame's movie, not jerry lee's. the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. james just really ticked me off for more than half the film. the dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.so, i'm glad it's not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. but hopefully, james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. don't you wish ashlee simpson would take that same advice? :d 3/10

i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work. i say "partly" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. sadly this film falls into the later category.this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film "howl's moving castle". an intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.the first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. from then on things go down hill. the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films.overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. what is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version i saw was an nth-generation copy, with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.

(this is a review of the later english release by disney, featuring alison lohman, patrick stewart, and co.) i really wanted this film to be good. really, really. i'm a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film, i was eager to see it. but i was shocked, shocked i say, at the quality of this film. those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever. this film just doesn't come close.might as well start w/ the positive aspects, though. like all miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy/sci-fi setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films) and the english voice acting is quite well done.but this film...just...isn't...good... the characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians, to everyone in between. once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen all there is. and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help.then there's the music... now, hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer, but nausicaa doesn't do him justice. half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive, and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.but wait! there's a great message with this film, right?! let's all save the environment! too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer. there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree. no, really. i ain't kidding.it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is. but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it. and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on, that's lame.if you're the kind of person who worships anime, enjoys 80's music, and plants a tree every arbor day, you will probably like this film. otherwise, save your money for his later films, because they rock big time.

tom wolfe's sprawling, brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served. the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie, kewpie-doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis (?!) as the darling of new york's literati. the most serious miscasting was in the director's chair. robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting, but brian de palma, for all of his visual sophistication, has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. honestly, if a satire does not make the viewer angry, what is the point?

based on tom wolfe's satirical novel that was praised by all (i have not read it yet) tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral.. the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs either..melanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film..this will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor.. on a scale of one to ten..3

as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film, i have a different take on why the film was such a flop. first, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. they are two different animals.the novel is probably intended as a satire, but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead. any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical thrust. and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain, think again. a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails. tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill. it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start. unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific people -- whether real or fictional straw men -- who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer. any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, free of the writer's influence or interference.having said that, i too find fault with the casting. it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up, but that real talents like tom hanks, f. murray abraham, and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures.there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire, but it fails to come even close.

the point of wolfe's original novel -- indeed the point of the whole story -- is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency. the goal is survival within a particular kind of life style. the novel is full of malice. the only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between sherman and his daughter, campbell, and that's only touched upon. that aside, everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity, power, money or self aggrandizement.wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of new york city over the head. his response was a denial. after all, he lived in new york himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked new yorkers. (wolfe has a phd in american studies from yale and is no dummy.) those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. nobody was any good. and sherman mccoy wound up broke, a professional protester for social justice. the movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit. wolfe did his homework. the novel was rooted in reality. every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable. wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist -- he knows how to get inside a system and record its details.yes, any of us might have found ourselves, as sherman and his mistress do, stuck in the south bronx, threatened by a couple of black kids, and making a getaway after bumping into one of them. that scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid. but after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message, however nebulous the message is. sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel, but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo, take out a shotgun, and start shooting into the ceiling with it, as he does in the movee. in what's supposed to be a funny scene, ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away, shrieking. it simply would not have happened. the movie has left the novel's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust. wolfe's sensibility, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. what we get instead is a noisy, fantastic, and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up. similar empty scenes follow, screaming out for wolfe's verisimilitude.the movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. here we see "don juan in hell" at the opera. we get lectures on redemption from a poet with aids. we see a lot of guilt in sherman. a black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again. a reporter who feels sorry for sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. and a happy ending in which sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. the scene sits on the movie like a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head. the movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal, it overstates them, as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties.it's not the acting or the direction that's poor. the film's not bad in those respects. and the photography is pretty good too, including two rather spectacular shots -- the gargoyles of the chrysler building and the landing of the concorde. it's the script that is thoroughly botched.the first half of the movie, roughly, is okay in conception and execution. it keeps some of the little details from the novel. sherman and judy's dog is named marshall. who the hell would name a dog marshall? it loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching.wolfe's cynical redneck right-wingism may be offensive to a lot of people, but he's got the cojones to lay his percepts out. alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of new yorkers.

most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters. they rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order. they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happen.if i hadn't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film, it didn't make you care about the characters, like them or dislike them. it turns the characters into jokes.awful.ridiculous.waste of two hours of my life.

regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma's career).sherman mccoy (tom hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover maria ruskin (melanie griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. his story is chronicled by another smug guy, reporter peter fallow (bruce willis).well, as i said in my summary...what is this movie supposed to be? it seems to combine comedy, drama, and satire, but it sure doesn't add up to much. it's undermined by unimaginably loathsome, one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life.i'm no big fan of the novel (i started reading it once, but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty.i've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail. what a waste.the problems start with casting nice guy tom hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic. and the role of peter fallow in the novel was that of a brit. bruce willis is badly, badly miscast in the role. what was the thinking there.alas, not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, being obliged to deliver a lame, heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax.this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce.i liked the assemblage of talent; for that i will give it four out of ten, but i'm sure some people will say a much better movie could have been made from the source material.

this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed. if they want to make a movie with a lousy story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book. there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title. i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen. at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product. the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. the actors are miscast. the director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon.if you've seen this movie and disliked it, try the book. if you've seen this movie and liked it, read the book.

this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there. but the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie. hanks is a great actor to be sure, but lacks the smarmy, morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role. jeff daniels would have been my choice.putting melanie griffiths in, for eye candy reasons, is understandable, but again, she did not portray the depth or ambivalence, so need to pull this off.this movie is a great example of how every decision, even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file.

if you are one of the people who finds "according to jim" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. and might i add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc, which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year."k-911" is a big, steaming, brown, german shepherd-sized "thank you" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve. jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard. look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.if you enjoy jim's work, this movie is your reward.

bonfires of the vanities is a film drenched in flop sweat. i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board. it is like a stand up comic who's not getting laughs, but can't leave the stage. the harder the film tries, the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud. the desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved.the film achieves laugh-out-loud status only twice. once is in the sight of geraldo rivera playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral tv tabloid journalist -- which is funny only because he apparently doesn't realize he is playing himself. the other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film's final "big moment," wherein the judge played by morgan freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is ("it's what your mama taught ya!"). the pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. yet, one must admit it is a noble effort. it does have a good, if poorly cast, band of actors, who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures. the film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director brian depalma just loves are apparent, if not particularly effective. but the film, which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics, never arises above the level of cartoon. satire requires style. farce requires energy. even sitcom requires timing. but the best bonfires can muster is desperation. in the end, you don't want to laugh, you just want to turn away.

the original was a good movie. i bought it on tape and have watched it several times. and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb. the romance was flat, the sight gags old, the spoken humor just wasn't. this may not have been the worst movie i've ever seen but it comes close.

i am very disappointed with "k-911." the original "good" quality of "k-9" doesn't exist any more. this is more like a sitcom! some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back. the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show. that was crazy. what's the deal with the change of police? it seems like they are now lapd! not san diego pd. it is a completely different movie from "

the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands. but she is speaking german to him. the 2 languishes are completely different, its like saying "well he takes french commands" and start talking spanish.james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest. the role just doesn't fit him, even if its mend to be a comedy.to many stereotype/predicable stuff. typical comment or comebacks.if you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv. but i wouldn't suggesting renting it.

this movie was just plain bad. just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. bad guy gets away? check. partner? check. wacky personality clash with partner? check. rookie with something to prove? check. rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they're saving those old chestnuts for dooley's next outing. add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. avoid this one at all costs.

i just got the uk 4-disc special edition of superman 1 for about $5. the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole-men. so i slapped it into the dvd player last night, and here are my findings.some initial disappointment - i hadn't checked, and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials. i'm not a huge fan of george reeves as superman, and i hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn - but hey ho, never mind.this black and white production runs for less than an hour. it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves' early tv series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series. in any event, it's an odd choice for reasons i'll get to later. i'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. even so, for a low budget movie, this one is really low budget.the story concerns the small town of silsby - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). the story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.a deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. the little guys scare some kids, so jeff corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these "creatures". superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised mole-man. superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. a total of 4 mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey (i call this an aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go "aargh!") and superman saves him. he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the mole-men go back down the shaft. the end.despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - i have left out all the "mole-man 1 creeps from a to b, looking out to make sure no-one is following him" stuff. the mole-men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. they do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.reeves is quite a good clark kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than phyllis coates' rather indifferent lois lane. but he is a terrible, terrible superman. not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. i'm sure he was told to "strike the pose" (which superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.and superman does a huge amount of walking around (i say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. he takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. in fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.i've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards i think it's a pretty threadbare effort. thankfully, production standards on the tv series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.something of a disappointment - i shan't be watching it again.

back in the 1970s, wpix ran "the adventures of superman" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years. every once in a while, we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air "superman and the mole men." i always looked forward to those days. watching it recently, i was surprised at just how bad it really was.it wasn't bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. true, george reeves' superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible. and true, the mole men's costumes were even worse. what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year-old, since the zippers, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. but these were forgivable shortcomings.no, what made it bad were the contrived plot devices. time and again, superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating. a lynch mob is searching for the creatures? rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man. the creatures are cornered? again, he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot. luke benson, the town's rabble-rouser, shoots at him? attempted murder to any reasonable person, but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems. superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud, but never once took advantage of them.that said, both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles. if only they had been given a better script to work with.

"you're not going to shoot those little creatures. in the first place, they haven't done you any harm. in the second place, they may be radioactive." ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi yet despite the odd gem like that, superman and the mole-men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. it's beyond cheap (the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute mole-men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and george reeves' man of steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by jeff corey from killing them. an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.

this film is notable for three reasons.first, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking george reeves' and phyllis coates' initial appearances as clark kent / superman and lois lane. part of the opening is re-used in the series. outside the town of silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow earth' allowing the 'mole-men' to come to the surface. forget about the other holes (those in the plot).second, unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. no 'mild mannered reporter' here! clark kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout ("i'll handle this!"), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole-man! as superman, he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as "nazi storm troopers." third, you will notice that the transition from the fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'adventures of superman' had not yet been made.

did anyone read the script. this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. three great actors, paul giamatti, rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out. about two-thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying, i can't believe i signed the contract. it's not the worst movie i ever saw, but it's on the really really bad christmas movie list. not enough lines, but what else can be said? okay, the movie just doesn't move with vaughn's con-man dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. it was just a lackluster walk through, that no one seemed to be able to get into.

i went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful. and it was. i really felt sorry for the star-studded cast- kathy bates was a wonderful actress... before she made this movie- vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for. fred's dad, played by trevor peacock (of vicar of dibley fame, amongst others), had about one line.the plot was predictable and all over the place, and the humour was... lacking. (however, there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train (actually- maybe the train would be better...)

the most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever. let's forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and saints don't have significant others. that, for a millennium, nick has been the jolly elf to fred's scrooge is never even hinted at! open on nick learning how to make toys, then on fred learning how to run numbers; nick giving a sick child a dolly, fred repossessing the dolly, along with the family farm! after a few more such episodes, morph to present-day fred venting his spleen at siblings anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy. there, i just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy!this santa, who is one "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss saddled with the queen of the harpies, an operation straight out of mega-mall hell, and answers to a board (huh?) which just gave the easter bunny his pink egg. oh, and his right-hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin-tight mini-dress and go-go boots. ho... ho... ho... ho... ho!but what really sent me over the edge was slam being named #1 on the naughty list. shouldn't a naughty list be reserved for the future hitlers and stalins? children who are the true embodiments of evil? nope, to old sausage-fingers, a good boy who lashes out because he is unwanted and unloved is the demon seed!the nimrods behind fred claus should be boiled in their own pudding! bah!

it's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you, always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. so, imagine that your older brother is santa and then imagine how tough that must be. that's the premise here.vince vaughn plays the titular fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother, santa (played by paul giamatti), too much praise for simply being the limelight-hogging, fame-hungry, slightly creepy guy that fred would want to portray him as. then, wouldn't you know it, fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to christmas. and hilarity and life lessons ensue.well, that's what should happen. the reality is that we get a christmas movie featuring a few good moments of vaughn's patented fast-talking, a ridiculously out-of-nowhere music video moment, kevin spacey playing an auditor out to close down santa's operation (and he's one of the weakest baddies i have seen in some time), not enough of the gorgeous elizabeth banks in a lush christmas outfit, too much of john michael higgins in his elf outfit (to be fair, he's a highlight though) and a movie that's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time.rachel weisz is along for the ride too, as is kathy bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie for vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here. unfortunately, there's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker. outside of vaughn's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem.david dobkin's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p christmas card that you send the auntie you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious christmas pudding. nope, we get a burnt, bland lump with too much sugar on top. forget this and stick the hilarious elf on again if you want a great, modern christmas comedy.see this if you like: the santa clause 2, santa baby, the santa clause 3: the escape clause.

"the domino principle" is, without question, one of the worst thrillers ever made. hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream "i give up!!!"how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks.i hope they spent their money well.

my take: a tired formula christmas comedy. the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too.i love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season. as if we already had enough santa clause movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? in a plot that would be at home with disney's santa clause franchise (save the occasionally crude humor and santa's "little" helper wearing a short skirt), fred claus is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. sure, jolly ol' saint nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? it's a shame really. fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. vince vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging santa (paul giamatti), who invites his good ol' brother to visit. mrs. claus (miranda richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (kevin spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas, and his this close to being shut down. hah! and guess who plays santa's mother! kathy bates of course. elizabeth banks is santa's helper charlene, john michael higgins is one of the elves, and rachel wiesz plays fred's girlfriend! si don't know if i'd praise the casting or to bash it. here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they're given way too little to work with.as for humor, the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf. i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by stephen baldwin, roger clinton and frank stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us "feel good" and teach us a lesson about "what christmas really means". apparently, what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can.rating: ** out of 5.

"fred claus" somehow avoids becoming this year's "the santa clause" by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer, but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater.as holiday movies go, it's contrived and sentimental. but actually, that could be the least of one's concern as "fred claus," boasting of having david dobkin ("shanghai knights," "the wedding crashers") at the helm, contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film. in the end, it amounts to not much of both. and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti, kevin spacey, rachel weisz, and kathy bates, all the more it leaves one disappointed.vaughn plays fred, nick's (giamatti) older and estranged brother, who once upon a time, left him and their parents (bates and trevor peacock) after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling. nick grows up to be santa claus (and as the voice-over tells us, time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint), while fred becomes a yuletide-jaded repo man in chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wanda's (weisz) birthday.he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who eerily looks at least a decade older than him) to bail him out of jail. nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy-wrapping business up in the north pole. fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature, even as an efficiency expert (spacey) is checking on the toy factory operations, only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things fail.the film, as said, does have its moments, but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration. in between are piles of christmas film clichés that were handled better in, say, "elf" and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake.vaugn, as usual, brings on his coarse charm to the table, but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing. giamatti, underneath the bad fat suit, brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, has to play second fiddle to fred. spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.ultimately, "fred claus" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve. sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are certainly far better ways.

well, i have to say, this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. and the worst part is, i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city, paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. vince vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time i've seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta. anyways, the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview, but it is filled with totally ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turn points. and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didn"t have to be saved, and that santa didn't need a replacdmetn, but nope. the only cool part was the sleigh rides, and the little bladck kid was the best character. i'm sure this movie would be great for young kids, but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through.

what did producer/director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy's novel and kennedy's very puzzling screenplay? were there a few pieces left out on purpose? and what about gene hackman, richard widmark, edward albert, eli wallach and mickey rooney? what did they see in this very muddled story?and why did candice bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role?the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin. a major misfire by stanley kramer.

stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. richard widmark, edward albert, and eli wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view, the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. kramer's direction is devoid of any style. it's a very sunny movie!the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey. even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick. one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife. we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell.

there are really two sections of this film. firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'the simpsons' troy mcclure should be doing the narration.then the rest of the film begins (starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film) which, while technically ok, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense.this is especially so with mickey rooney's spiventa, who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? in that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is.the overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy. it's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.put simply, the film fails on all levels.

first, it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. what a waste of time, we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. again, another 20 minutes. then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. all of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. by the time the real action gets going, i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end. hackman is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.

gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination. it's a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job.nobody tells him anything though, he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information. that's supposed to be suspenseful, instead it's annoying and boring. hackman goes through with the mission, but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up. so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care.one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit. maybe something really was lost in the translation, but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience.a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark, candice bergen, mickey rooney, eli wallach, and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime. and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this, the fbi, the cia, the dea or even the irs.

i can't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie. that's all i've got to say - the movie speaks for itself!!

i love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick.i can only wonder, what were they thinking agreeing to this crap???debra winger just phoned it in; dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures. some people thought it was deep. well, if you liked "breaking the waves", you'll probably like this too. i hated both. 3/10

blazing saddles! it's a fight between two estranged brothers (dennis quaid and arliss howard), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest debra winger caught in the middle. director glenn gordon caron (the tv whiz-kid behind "moonlighting") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in vince gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. these aren't even characters, they're plot functions. barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good. winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed. *1/2 from ****

let's see. in the "st. elsewhere" finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child. "newhart" ended by telling us that it had all been a dream. and "roseanne" ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind. very "creative". annoying was more like it. yes, it was just a tv show and wasn't at all reality. it's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all "real". at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen. this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. now "newhart" being all a dream? at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever. roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.

"women? they're all scrubbers...!" no, not a good translation; not at all! this lags behind the previous year's "dad's army", entirely missing the special, small-screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original, and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen... you could just about say that this film well represents a britain entering decline, and more precisely even than that, a *british film industry* entering decline. and that is hardly a recommendation, is it? to be an exemplar of saddening folly...all that remains after the subtlety of the tv original has been surgically stripped away, by cliff owen, galton and simpson are: endless, dilapidated musical cues, yawn, from the ron grainer theme... bolstered sentimentality (that shoddy, thick-eared ending... how much bolder does the second steptoe film seem in comparison) an increased seediness - with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely - fully applicable to something like the 'misbegotten monstrosity' (yours truly on this site) from 1973, "the mutations". there is a strangely botched, cut-adrift tone about the scene where harold is beaten up in a rugby club, that i partly hate and recoil it (so far, as a friend intimated, from the mood of the tv series...), but this at least seems an original slant, and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the britain of 1972... there is, however, an implied prostitute, aye of a 'heart-of-gold' who turns loose woman-traitor 'pon poor auld 'arold - and beyond-caricature writing of the 'class' element; not to mention, surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads. brambell and corbett collude with the script, and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham. what would anthony aloysius hancock have made of it all...? i will merely concede that a few moments just about work - chiefly those where g & s play things a little more carefully and b & c touch tenderer nerves - and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair. but, and oh, how this pains me to say it: it is tiresome, boring, both wilfully detached from reality and what made the tv series great, and also fully in tune with the lazy, tawdry, misogynist 'fuck it, that'll do...' actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film-making in the britain of the time.

let me start by saying how much i love the tv series. despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. in my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time. the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.this movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film. this movie has a very dreary, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. seeing harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie. the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.the romance between harold and zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series. in the tv series, harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers.albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series. in the movie, albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.most movie spin-offs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the on the buses films (which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself!). but, steptoe and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below george and mildred.my advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, steptoe and son ride again instead. it has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the tv series, and is actually very funny.

despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is an awful movie. awful enough, that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. the movie is set in the final period of the raj, during the time of india's fight for independence. what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. what the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era. for instance, would the young married hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married englishman master, knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment? unlikely, but still maybe. however, would the same young hindu housemaid, in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spears in heat, partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment? that is not only bloody unlikely, that is a retarded plot line.such idiocies combined with the poor acting, drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie, so i did not watch the second half of the movie. one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half.

i have to admit that i liked the first half of sleepers. it looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. a superior hollywood film. but...no one mentioned this so far (at least in the latest 20 comments), when it came to the courtroom scenes and brat pitt´s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, i felt cheated. this movie insulted my intelligence. warning spoilers!!why did anyone accept their false alibi, witnessed by the priest? if these two guys had been with him, why shouldn´t they tell this during the investigation? amnesia? if you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away?i am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me. this movie had great potential. 4/10

this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it, they might wake up and do something about it. over the last few months, abc family began airing a new format of movies. i have seen the last three and enjoyed them. they were engaging and did the trick. my wife likes these films. i was looking forward to viewing "see jane date". the trailers looked and sounded great. unfortunately, this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project. the year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. it was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. it worked against it. i work in the business of film and television . i enjoy being entertained. this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse. the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie. to add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. an advice to the executives at disney, abc , abc family and the producers: under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films. they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word "contemporary" , "present day" and "current" means when describing a romantic comedy. there is a world passing you by. all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von zerneck-sertner and abc family.

this movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. there are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).*mild spoilers*we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. instead, director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.*end spoilers*avoid this one. for an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the korean film a tale of two sisters (2003).

this series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. there's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. at times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "cub," who nearly gets lost early on. all in all, disappointment.that said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.

"arahan" adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre. to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen chow's films is a mistake.firstly the fight scenes are nothing new. all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang, tony jaa and jackie chan. fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic. there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the "matrix" sequels.the attractive female lead so-yi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in "house of flying daggers". having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies. to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see aya ueto in "asumi") unless you are a very talented director which as "arahan" proves seung-wan ryoo is not.

i began watching this movie with my girl-friend. and after 5 minutes i was alone.i succeed to stay until the end. it has been a painful experience.i liked jean hugues anglade, but i think that he needed to eat, as us, and thus he accepted to play in this movie. there are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called 'art' or something that i couldn't express, but that i didn't understand at all.the only worst movie i saw was crash, but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again.good luck!! ;o)

i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat. but this is no swat. swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. bullfighter had none of these. i should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role.one poster here called the movie incoherent. another called it the worst movie ever. both gave the movie far too much credit. i am so glad i got it from the library for free, yet i still feel ripped off.imdb needs to include a "0" in the "rate this film" vote, just for movies like this one.

i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. it was buy 2 get 2 free and i needed one more so i chose this one. horrible mistake. the box reads like it would be a really good movie. well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie. for about 5 minutes, that is. the movie is about a young woman, laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, jack, from a bull. laila's dad, cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of. he assumes that jack killed laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. that was the first 5 minutes that is good. what follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse. whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever. jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride. i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character. you know, jesus' mother. but, who knows, i couldn't make heads or tails of it. as they're running... we get to see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc... and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on. needless to say, i took the movie back and exchanged it for something else. it's horrible i tell ya, horrible. and, there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie. unless you count the first minute of the movie. hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie.

some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential. but it never comes together as anything more than a student's graduate thesis in film school.there are two primary reasons for this. fist, there is not a single likable character, not even a villain we might admire for his/her chutzpah. secondly, all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe. the ham is so plentiful here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up.all right, i'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said, the camera work is quite good.but i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a "modern western", and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making.that betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we don't like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly muddled, and in the last analysis, we just don't care.i took it out of the dvd player about half way through. but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back.now, that really hurts.

i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe, and robert rodriguez. i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it, than it has to be good right? wrong wrong wrong. by far the worst editing since "manos hands of fate". the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore. i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film, maybe they owed somebody, but they are way to good for this. besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn't even talk. so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing, poor acting, and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned.

i didn't know willem dafoe was so hard up for bucks that he'd disgrace himself with such shocking hamming in this monstrosity. hell: i'll donate that money that i was going to send to ethiopia if he's that desperate. i have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long time...who paid for this? they are either pulling some tax scam or insane. a 5-year old would be ashamed of the plot, and i'd rather get cancer than sit through more than the hour i suffered already. everybody involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison. avoid at all costs. i'd give it minus 10 if possible...unbelievable.

"bullfighter" was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason. i wonder why? could it be: the confusing storyline, the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez, and the annoying editing? it's got to be. i think the plot was mary (michelle forbes) and jacque (oliver martinez) go on a mystical road trip. they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too. the movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. most movies, when trying to subtle, don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects.don't be fooled by the cover: willem dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.

no scenario, bad actors (poor melissa gilbert)... beurk beurk beurk ...give a such budget to make this... in belgium, we make ten films which win all prices in cannes with this.last time that i've seen a such null-film was hypercube. but scenario was better.is anyone knows if the director was a graduate in school-film or a cop ?the better things in this film was the word "end".why authorize to sell this ? 1ç is to expensive. i've pay ten dollars to buy this.for me, pay for this was my big mistake of millennium.too bad.next time i'll break my arm but buy this type of sh*t.

i am very tolerant of really bad sci/fi and horror movies - i've been watching them since i was 4 or 5, so i've seen some really bad stuff, but i deal with it. i've even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much - a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of. hope springs eternal, i guess - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. unfortunately, this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it, but like a moth to the flame, i kept thinking something, anything, interesting would happen. it doesn't. all of the actors give a decent performance - given the script, i don't know how they all kept straight faces. it has something to do with collagen-starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. there's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans...don't worry, he gets what's coming to him. the slug people themselves don't really know where they came from, they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth, but...somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self...oh, must i go on? please, i implore you, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this...anything would be better...think of the worst, least enjoyable way you can spend two hours...it would be better than this.

the movie opens upon julian sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. that was so provocative, and i thought, "here we go! a good vampire movie!" and then it died. that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination. it was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter. i was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with sands' acting was quite enjoyable. however, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.even julian sands's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.it rates a 1.1/10 from...the fiend :.

i love julian sands and will at least attempt to watch anything he's in, but this movie nearly did me in. i'm hard pressed to remember when i found any other movie to move....so......slow.........ly.....zzzzzzzzzzzzpop it in the vcr when you've run out of sleeping pills.

the opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta. the attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish i had better control of the fast forward control. vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures. this vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. i usually tally a body count, so there was a cat (which doesn't count) a bum, a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her (whatever that was about) and then the plot. foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly. i liked warlock, but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off, and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again.

(note: i thought i'd be the only one writing what i did below, but i see the others here agree. i guess it was pretty obvious - this was overdoing the bait-the-cat bit. anyway, here is what i had written:)the owners have left on vacation for two weeks - a trip to california - leaving the cat (sylvester) all alone and locked in the house. that means no milk, but the cat, to his relief, does find a bunch of canned tuna. however, to his dismay, he can't find the opener.it turns out the little mouse in the house has it...and baits the cat with it. this is a mean rodent who keeps teasing sylvester with the opener and then yanking it away at the last second. sylvester tries everything possible to open the can of tuna but can't do it. this is a frustrating story, and why they make the sadistic mouse the "good guy" is beyond me. it's like some of the tom & jerry cartoons where poor tom always gets the worst of it even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict!

semana santa is jaw-droppingly bad. it's so wrong in so many ways i don't where to begin. so, let's see...mira sorvino, whose judge husband has been shot while protecting her, goes from madrid to seville for her cop job. during the holy week (semana santa, see?...everybody begins to fall sleep..told u it was bad in so many points, even from the beginning), a killer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena. she teams up with male chauvinist pig olivier martinez and nice feodor atkine. soon she discovers she'll be the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). why, oh but why?why..;that's the questionthat has been in my head the whole movie.q :why did go to see that a : because i love mira sorvino (i even excuse her for that at first sight crap)q : why were we only 8 people in the theater this saturday on the first week end of release? a : ah-ah-ah. spider-man got relaesed the same day. but also the fact that the movie has been blast with execrable reviews.q : why this movie has been made? a : money i guess. but boy did mira need the money.then...why???????????? first of all, there's always something wrong with european co-productions. here you got a french-english-german-italian-spanish-danish production. yi-ha.then it wants to play on the same playgroung as us thrillers/slashers/whodunit/mysteries/whatever. even valentine, though unnecessary and badly scripted and shot, was much better in the suspense and the fun.then , to give some credit to the story, the screenwriter wanted to add some political sight to the story. wrong : done in flash-backs in a traffic-like photography, it's certainly the most interesting thing i n the movie. could have stick to it, it wouldn't have to sit through the whole movie. better go straight to guillermo del tros's the devil's backbone (el espinazo del diablo)for some clever fun.then the homophobia. bullseye! the first victims are s&m drug addicted gay twins who got stabbed to death. the annoying olivier martinez goes to a dating agency held by a badly shaved overweight transvestive with a blond platinum wig. calls mira sorvino's character a big dyke all the time. do we need this kind of stuff? nah. just needless offensive remarks, just like ol'times.then the suspense. yipee. no apparent motive. the first murders are plain illusion as they're a representation of a famous painting. but no. and the revelation of the killer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been done from the beginning as he appears at the end of the movie as, i guess, it was time for the director to say "weel, time to finish that damn movie. let's reveal right now who the killer is and why he kills".then the director thinks he's a director. wrong : no sense of suspense, no sense of directing the actors, no knowledge of change of pace. a giant, mega-bore. the scenes of the holy week are needless (maybe a co-production rule saying : ok, shoot in sevilla but show some creditsof this beautiful and historical town with the celebrations of easter. there we are : a mystery movie for tourists!)then the actors. all wrongs. mira sorvino bores herself to death : she does practicly nothing except getting stabbed in the right hand. everything she did best (the replacement killers, mighty aphrodite...) were like they never existed. olivier martinez...hello, anybody here? when the producers will learn that he's not an actor but a mannequin with no ability of speech nor feelings? feodor atkine, bland and transparent. only do we pay great respect to alida valli, one of the greatest actress this last century (and i hope for some more roles in this current one). she's tha main attraction here as she's the only one to give life to her poor lines. i won't mention the other actors as they're only one-sided characters, uninteresting and shallow.incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, implausible plot. idiocy incarnated.superwonderscope says : 1

"semana santa" or "angel of death" is a very weak movie. mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people. mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time. couldn't she just speak english? all the other characters have a forced mexican\english accent which is distracting. the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden. the cinematography looks nice, but that's not enough to save this tripe. this next part of this review does contain spoilers!!!! during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away, but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing. that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever. avoid!

it is a frank zappa axiom that "music journalism is people who can't write interviewing people who can't talk for people who can't read." if you ever needed proof that musicians can't talk, this is the film for you. repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices: "wow." (thank you, idris muhammed.) this film is pretentious but, while much of the pontificating from youssou n'dour and his gang of merry men (and one token woman) grates, the music saves the day.the main idea behind the film (what i take to be the main idea, dredged out of the inarticulate commentary) is interesting. to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery, back to their roots in the music of west africa, and a concert in the old slave fort of gorée off the coast of senegal. we are treated to gospel, blues, jazz and variations of these, including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal. there's also a good deal of n'dour's own compositions.sadly, that's another weakness. it's never entirely clear what n'dour himself wants to achieve. to some degree, the film appears to be an exercise in self-promotion on n'dour's part. he wants to play his own music, jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires. he's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gorée museum.the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places. for example, somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir, but n'dour and most of his mates are moslems (a point made repeatedly throughout the film). the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group (the only black christians who can hold a tone?) turn up in dakar at the end of the film. (to be fair, they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film.) if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel, why not also in the direction of latin america? where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil? samba? reggae? then there's europe. here the black diaspora doesn't seem to have produced any musicians of calibre, since n'dour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg. are they in the team just because n'dour has played with him before? what i personally found most irritating, though, was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik/black power/nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka (a.k.a. leroi jones). hearing people talk about the importance of "knowing your history", and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance. why do so many african-americans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots? and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity? who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place? the film doesn't have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that "present conditions" are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years. the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy, musical gifted folk, friendly and welcoming, respectful of their elders (and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market). is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination? there is no comment on the armed guard that n'dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar.there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar. the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence. the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland, bidding them farewell. except, of course, that by and large, the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar. they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gorée slave fort. the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade, they are just as likely  more likely  to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile.the two agenda's clash again in the final part of the film. there are two separate endings. on the one hand, the concert which n'dour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gorée slave fort. the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual "return to glory", in the seaward doorway of the slave fort. this is deeply moving, even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears.this is a film that is flawed. unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions. irritating, confusing, beautiful and emotional by turns. watch it (listen to it) for the music and the feeling, but don't expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour.

oh, man! this thing scared the heck out of me when i first watched it... and i was sixteen!!!that creepy animated barbie is scary as hell! i want to stop talking about her now.

i loved "the curse of frankenstein" so much that i rushed out to get "frankenstein must be destroyed" to see cushing at it again...even if it was without chistopher lee this time. to my great disappointment, this movie not only does without lee, but it does without frankenstein's monster altogether! was it a case of "if we can't get lee, we won't have a monster at all"? why would they do that? the monster is half the fun of the whole thing!! this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum. i found the script extremely weak, with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much. i'm willing to suspend a fair amount, but this movie got fairly ridiculous, which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.peter cushing, though, is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film. for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men, he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well. the supporting cast is competent, but has little to do, even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping frankenstein. a bumbling police chief is introduced, along with his put-upon sidekick, to generate some comic relief, then they are completely dropped from the movie! why? we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron, then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor, and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein's brain transplant experiment. there was no tension, we weren't invested in the "creature", and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel.also, there are virtually no "horror" elements. yes, there is a beheading in the beginning (off-camera), and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men's skulls off (again, off camera), and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene (90% of which is, again, off-camera). i understand that there is a love of "letting the audience imagine it all, for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show", but come on, if you're not going to give us a monster, then at least let us see the few "horrific" elements you do choose to include. showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary.on top of a weak script, i thought the directing was mostly flat. there were a couple of nice shots, but otherwise no excitement, atmosphere, or suspense was generated. the same director did "curse" back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed...guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was.the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushing's powerful, nuanced performance...beyond that, i found little in this movie worth recommending. instead, my suggestion is to watch "the curse of frankenstein" and see a truly great hammer horror film.

there are three movies with this animation style that i fondly remember from my youth. this movie, "the last unicorn," "flight of dragons" and "the hobbit." i own copies of both "dragons" and "the hobbit" (both excellent) and i hadn't seen "the last unicorn" in more than a decade. that was until today and now i wish i hadn't. what bothered me the most was the script. it was incredibly choppy and often inane. things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. we're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! the story itself isn't that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent. not even close. on top of that the music was awful! i know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball. this was one of those films that i was going to show to my kids some day, but it just got cut. i don't think i could ever sit through that crap fest again. disappointed is putting it mildly.

songwriter robert taylor (as terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and can't see straight over otherworldly norma shearer (as consuelo). "she makes the sun shine, even when it's raining," mr. taylor explains. but, mr. taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near ms. shearer. finally, at the palm beach casino shearer frequents, taylor proclaims "i love you!" shearer brushes him off, as she is engaged to george sanders (as tony). however, to settle a gambling debt, shearer hires taylor to pose as "her cardboard lover", to make mr. sanders jealous.this film's title invites the obvious and appropriate three-word review: "her cardboard movie". it is most notable as the last film appearance for shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from "he who gets slapped" (1924, playing another consuelo) to "the women" (1939). to be fair, this was likely the kind of shearer film mgm believed audiences wanted to see. however, the part is unflattering.plucked and powered, taylor and shearer were better off in "the escape" (1940). if shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than "leading lady"; apparently, she was no longer interested, and certainly didn't need the money. taylor has a great scene, reciting christina rossetti's "when i am dead, my dearest" while threatening to jump from shearer's balcony, as directed by george cukor.**** her cardboard lover (6/42) george cukor ~ norma shearer, robert taylor, george sanders

even by 1942 standards of movie-making the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme. the machinations of one half of a pair (of husband/wife, ex-husband/ex-wife) to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another, divorce, or an eventual separation by means of jealousy, humiliation, or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story. both of these movies features women with a strong, indomitable screen presence and who played independent, proto-feminist characters. in both movies, both women were estranged/divorced from their (witty) first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite, and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon-to-be husbands and re-igniting their passion for each other.the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender: here, it's norma shearer in the cary grant role out, this time, to ward off an ex-boyfriend (george sanders) by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo. the problem is, shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid-to-late twenties; sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most -- any man who would be in love with his fiancée, on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here, would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene. not here. and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time, not in speech inflections but in overall essence.but the worst part of it is shearer herself. for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence, playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over-acting, over-emoting, and over-gesturing which, while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier, makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge. it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of (most of her) roles; why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs. miniver on mega-hits now voyager and mrs. miniver is a mystery, but then again, most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting, that she'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and can't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible. such could be the case here. she seems lost, she seems tired, she seems ill at ease, going through autopilot instead of living the part. after this film she would make no more, but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s.

sorry. someone has to say it. this really is/was a dull movie. worthy perhaps, but dull nonetheless. i nearly cried with boredom when watching it. the acting is pretty dire, the story drawn out and predictable, the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting. it's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate (becase it is about disabled people) but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does. it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie. i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective. this was made to win awards - which i remember it duly did. but it was neither interesting nor entertaining. i haven't seen the play so cannot compare.

so, this movie has been hailed, glorified, and carried to incredible heights. but in the end what is it really? many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work. the fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated, and scenes that are in asl are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent. the voice interpretation of matlin's dialogue, under the excuse that hurt's character "likes the sound of his voice", turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on. matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view. but nonetheless, most of the movie, when this is a love story, is only showed from a single point of view, that of the man. as ebert said, "if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate, it's not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them."the idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as "revolutionary" is fairly insulting in itself. his character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on. drawing comedy from a deaf accent is, quite honestly, rather low. and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women: as an entitled man. a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated, in a way that's fairly inconsistent with his credentials: i have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they weren't aware of a deaf person being in the area, and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to. as a lover, he seems like a typical dogged nice guy, including his tendency to act possessively afterwards. and yet the movie is, indeed, only really seen through him, as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice. the scenes involving the other deaf kids are, in general, wallbangers. the broken symbolism fails, the dance scene, the pool scene, even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it - all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors, at best: many hearing people i know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel (instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas), and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness (no, seriously, when i go swim, i go swim)...it also fails at carrying the end of the play, instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man. even though the original play ended with a more equal ground, where both have to accept each other as they are, and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands, not the vibrations in her throat.and for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be, marlee matlin remains hollywood's token deaf woman to this day.

when i rented this movie, i had very low expectations......but when i saw it, i realized that the movie was less (a lot less) than what i expected. the actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid...it could work for a disney movie (except for the murders), but this one is not a comedy, it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. the title is well chosen except for one thing: they could add stupid movie after dead husbands! i give it 0 and a half out of 5.

dead husbands is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands`. it`s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies i could mention but it never fufils its potential . imagine how good this could have been if we had the farrelly brothers directing ben stiller in the role of carter elson .oh is carter based on jerry springer ? just curious because the catch phrase on dr elson`s show is " look after each other and keep talking "

you can be fooled by your first impressions. as in, initial reactions to a movie, for example. as in, the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it (first of all, i love black comedies). could even - despite being male, myself - empathise with the feisty girls' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay. was tripped up by my own face-value (and, i do mean "face-value") response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture. it just goes to show you that you've gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it's bad (and not "bad good," either): the reason i'm giving this movie a "4" rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams (the rest of 'er is pretty good, too); but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics - which means you'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen. the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it. i don't think it's a total waste of time, but....

there is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of the indian runner. unzip your trousers. peek inside. is there evidence of a y chromosome? okay, you'll do.this film has all the male requisites: blood, guns, car chases, fond women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics -- what have i left out? -- oh, yeah, blowtorches.as a woman, i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a `when i was a child...' kind of effort. since he both wrote and directed the thing, he's nearly solely responsible. an uneven cast (viggo mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done) tries to save penn. too late. the lines and action are there. even devoted, skilled acting can't change those.i found this movie puerile and silly, as well as predictable. the dialogue staggers along -- sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity. then she dies. after a bit, so does the protagonists' father, played by charles bronson. their absence is hardly noticeable.at intervals, the pyrotechnics, etc., noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring.if you're male and under 25, you may adore this film. plan to return to it at 35. think you'll still like it?i don't think so.

penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. however there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is screwed up. supposedly set in 1963, the music is late 60s/early 70s. the references and dialogue is 70s/80s. the potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and penn allows it to slip away. but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch, but not great.

thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor. david morse is the responsible, straight-laced cop and 'good' brother; viggo mortensen, the 'bad' boy, is a former soldier and ex-convict. as an actor (particularly in his earliest years), sean penn seems to have modulated his performances under the method. turning first-time writer and director for this arty, obtuse drama, he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process, slowing the pacing down to a crawl (ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection). this approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to care about, but photogenic morse and mortensen aren't really convincing as siblings. worse, we expect more from prominently-billed veterans charles bronson and sandy dennis, who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting. the picture is balky with turgid sequences, a wobbly narrative and confusing editing (always slanted to point up the artistic excesses). penn's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye, yet they are mostly an irritation. *1/2 from ****

i don't like sean penn's directing very much, and this early work, the indian runner, is no exception. the movie has no core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. frank miller, robert rodriguez, clint eastwood, sean penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hell's angels greetings, and make me long for the days of deliverance, which is a fine movie. viggo mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg, and that's about it. the movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. kudos for charles bronson, however, who proves he can act. and i wanted more of sandy dennis' character. a lousy 3 out of 10 for this the indian runner crap.

there is something in most of us, especially guys, that admires some really working class small town "real men" populist fare. and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top. hey, a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy, but i don't rate movies or actor/directors based on politics or personality. that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does. while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director, i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since. okay, you have the gist of this there is this good cop, a small town trooper, joe, played against type by david morse, who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars. the bad guy stops, gets out, shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead. there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone. so we know that joe, the farmer forced off his land into a cop job, is a good basic sort of guy. then his brother frank shows up, he is a sadistic, amoral bully, fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up. some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral, sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off. then there is mom and dad, marsha mason and charles bronson, who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple, then die off; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide, to advance the story for us. both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob. but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife. but joe has a nice wife, played by italian actress valeria golina, who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut. for me, that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool.but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car, robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do. then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them.so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater. accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate, except for the 60's era effect, to win the hearts of old hippies. the worst offense is that, since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song, "the highway patrolman", that song was not included. so joe's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife. the bartender is good ole ceasar, played by dennis hopper. so viggo - frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves.so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away. instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's junker on some lonely road at night, and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe, the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence. oy, such dreck! then to top off this drecky sap fest, there is some zen crap about the indian runner, who is a messenger, becomes the message, ala marshall macluhen? see what i mean, sean has done much better than this so don't be afraid to miss this one.

rodney dangerfield is a great. he has done a lot of great works. but this one....is awful. the whole plot is whack. it could have been much better. the jokes in the movie aren't funny....their stupid. this was very not so hilarious. he can do much better than this.

having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered, having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - i simply couldn't believe it: the movie is really awful. in fact it is so awful, that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced(!). during this, i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. the pattern is as follows: take one extremely popular comedian, make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners), and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that, and you have a success! i wouldn't know if this movie was a success, but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly (with a few great comedians) it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us.

unbelievably awful film. i watched part of this on t.v. recently. my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel. not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield's body, slap him around and scream, "how could you?" i know many films are done in haste, hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. but please, hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. it's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe. the bottom of the cesspool, even by sunday afternoon television standards.

if you want to see women's breasts, get a porno. there is no plot, but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan. the only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny, and, yes, boobs are boobs.

i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "malibu express." with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. the plot written by sidaris, which was ungratefully passed up by the academy, is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns. the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy. cleverly, ksxy is actually their secret headquarters. in "fit to kill" they confront their long-time nemesis kane, who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds. a well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come. it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized. i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking. the costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking. it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself. my personal rating is 10/10. the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero. andy, keep up the good work.

this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i've ever seen, and that's saying something. the chant of viva chiba, viva chiba is heard at the title, soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid, stupid. the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them, of course that's our man sonny chiba. the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords. a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard, but what are her true intentions? let me say at this point who cares? soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment. sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills, end of story. oh yeah the woman was corrupt too. congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever.as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen. what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be. some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film. that's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it's beyond funny. i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70's karate scene was at the time. watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student (bad editing) punching him in the throat. but everything is badly done in this film. terrible unbelievable fights, fake i mean fake blood, bad acting, dubbing, wardrobe, and let's not forget the story. one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country? i bet. fight after fight is laughable. this was the 70's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight, but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie. let's see he kicks a gun in half, kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene, give me a break. not to mention the fact that it's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it's filmed so poorly. one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture. ok. as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood, really fake blood. too say it looked poorly made is and understatement. the acting is totally non existent in this film. i don't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good, but it wasn't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor. was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent? as expected from a 70's wardrobe you'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks. also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time? don't try and hide it now. the characters were stupid as well. the pimp club owner's one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie. also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling. it was very annoying.overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making. that doesn't mean that it's not entertaining. with a film made so poorly it's hard not to laugh through most of this film, if you can stomach it. this was an old favorite watch with my best friend. if it was purely bad i would give one star, but the laughs it delivers bumps it up. 4 out 10.

everything in this film is bad , the story , the acting , the effects but its funny , funny , funny !!!scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious ! the ''terrorists'' are as scary and realistic as the ''raptors'' , this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh .the part where the giant t-rex who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending .if your into bad films , this is the pot of gold , the mona lisa of b-b-bad !!!

i just couldn't stop laughing!! this movie is incredibly funny and stupid! but, never mind that, it is very entertaining! in this film, you don't need to pay attention to anything! the acting is the same - lame! the dinosaurs are the same - rubber (oh, my i could see the stick that holds t-rex head for a moment.) the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2, t-rex is also the same, but... in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten. action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually i talk about fast editing, they edited it so fast, so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs, but oopps! to late, they are rubber! well, only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel.what can i say... don't rent it... watch it on tv, with friends, it is much more entertaining!

primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a low budget b movie and it knows it.a bunch of terrorists high-jack a lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but no..... it contains two dino's with a taste for human flesh... then a crack team, who might as well be called delta force get called in.ok, this ain't jurassic park, and yes the dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a costume that's not too dissimilar to barney the dinosaur - only slightly less terrifying,but come on guys this had about 1% of jurassic park's budget and as such does what it can.does this deserve to be in the bottom 100?....hell no!!! i think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being way way overly harsh, it's much closer to a 4... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the bottom 100, and has a similar production value to a sci-fi channel production. (again movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on imdb)the acting is as expected in a b movie although none of the actors take it that seriously, neither does the scriptall in all it's an enjoyable b movie - not for film snobs** out of *****

i don't know where to start; the acting, the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine. i can't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said, "our job is done, time for it's release". i'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk. i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are.i don't know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the "terrifying" dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around.

this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the privilege to see.i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish.the story is simple enough: terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium, but it's actually carrying a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. easy mistake to make. cue a startlingly incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts. they are led by colonel rance, played by scott valentine; a man who seems to have perfected 'smell the fart' acting, as advocated by joey in friends.there's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting, but unfortunately rance's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, lumbering monsters. also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a velociraptor attacks (preumably so we can't see how bad the creature effects are).having said all that, we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next.as a jusassic park / aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur's crotch, but as ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek entertainment it's a roaring success.

the third installment of the "carnosaur" trilogy features a bunch of keystone kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a t-rex. i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can't be taken seriously. more significantly, however, watching this movie i can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "carnosaur" and "xtro" trilogies. the first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "alien" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-cheek, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing. also, like the "xtro" franchise, all the "carnosaur" movies are completely unrelated to one another. they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the "sequels," i guess. obviously "carnosaur" and "xtro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two.

well here i go with another b industry movie. it's sad enough to see some badly made films but i don't care if a b industry or c industry produces the film. show some effort in your work. the characters are really bad. the acting isn't in question in this one (surprise), but plot is. how can a tight-knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered, and then go on as if nothing happened. what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was. give me a break.

put aside a dr. house repeat that i had missed, and a desperate housewives (new) to watch this one. i don't know exactly what plagued this movie. i never thought i'd say this, but i want my 15 minutes of fame back.script, direction, i can't say. i recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but thought herbert marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick. boy, was i wrong. dullsville.my favorite parts: where the "office girl" makes with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards into a 087 sorter. lol @ "the computer". i'd like someone identify the next device - a 477 ? it's before even this dinosaur's time.and we dinosaurs don't have that much time to waste.

i'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic. the little girl was a brat, their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked. besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe. if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile, not a gator. obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc. it is a sad excuse for a movie. especially the ending. i nearly fell asleep with this one.

not to be confused with lewis teague's "alligator" (1980) which actually is an excellent film, this "il fiume del grande caimano" laboriously ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino made around the end of the seventies (including the rather watchable "l'isola degli uomini pesce" and the not so good "la montagna del dio cannibale"). tracing outrageously the plot of "jaws", the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever. the creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable. stelvio cipriani's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptile's meal. no thrill out of this, rather laughters actually! and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude. we could excuse badly made films and poor fxs, but not that kind of mentality. never!

very bad film. very, very, very bad film. it's a rarity, but it defenitly is not worth hunting down. this italian jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time, and no sense the rest. the "alligator" is not at all convincing, and many of the sub-plots go nowhere. if it's at the local video store, you may want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth hunting down.

ok - the cons first: the obligatory '70's alligator (all right, correction - caiman) with nonmoving limbs is made the worse for scale miniature underwater shots (with the full length of reptile comparative to the size of the boat) utilizing a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in broadly lit water - even for nighttime shots!unlike most primitives-killing-exploitative-westerners films, the superstitious natives going bat**** and start massacring the vacationers seems unjustified this time. no one really abused the natives - exploited, yes, but far from abusive treatment. after all it was one of the natives (canoodling with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon) that brought the curse of the river demon on them, right?the vacationers are easily annoying (with the notable exception of the token old-soul/mildly blasphemous-little-girl-who-takes-a-shine-to-the-heroes that you often see in 70's euroflicks), but far from from deserving violent death - unless they were your next door neighbors, mind you. a couple actually get killed being heroic - notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick. there are only two straight villains in the entire film, so the demises feel more arbitrary than cathartic.the sequence where the giant caiman crunches down and scarfs thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious.the point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving westerners and practically saying "hey, you aren't so bad after all, sorry about that fuss last night" - because they blew up the monster lizard - has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in. you know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for ****ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll...the pros: barbara bach. barbara bach. barbara bach. barbara bach. you all know why you're interested in this film in the first place, right? i thought so. if you're a bach completist, get the dvd reissued by noshame films earlier this year (digitally remastered with no real extras to speak of, aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution).the hero isn't half bad, being far from an idiot (always a plus in b films) and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief.worth a look, but get it cheaply!

i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie. it's not bad enough to be hilarious. there's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity (although there was plenty of opportunity). there's no gore. there's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music. that last part was actually funny on many occasions: you see these natives hitting congas and 'jembés' and that's indeed what you hear (badly synchronized) on the soundtrack. but they also added this funky bass-line on the soundtrack. so, where was the bass-player? at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists. why all of the sudden? it's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex, which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river-alligator-god (i actually missed the explanation for that one). but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex, so why the sudden angriness? and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water??? it's all silly and pointless. this movie also features the skinniest afro-american model i've ever seen.at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird, crazy old man lives. the only point to that scene is that they make the "shocking" discovery that the killer-crocodile is actually an alligator. crocodile or alligator, what's the difference? it's big, it's made out of plastic and it eats people. all the same to me. the alligator is a rather silly creation. it's very stiff & motionless and doesn't even flap its feet when it swims. the eyes don't even move when they're shot in close-up. i guess they didn't know 'animatronics' back then in italy during 1979. there's also a lot of pointless inter-cut shots of the local wildlife. i suspect it's stock footage.like, i said, the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didn't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didn't want to wake the sweet thing. but the last half hour of the movie did get better. we finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them. the most entertaining (and at the same time funny) scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses. we're looking at a matchbox-version of the van falling in the river here. funny. but nicely shot. in fact there are several other nice traveling camera-moves. surprisingly for this type of flick. i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie, but i don't wanna spoil it completely, in case you do decide to watch this movie. my advice is to stay away from it. if you wanna see a decent alligator movie, then see lewis teague's alligator. i admit, that one isn't italian and isn't a jaws rip-off, but it certainly is more fun. and if you're interested in other movies made by director sergio martino, then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019: after the fall of new york. that one's an over-the-top rip-off of every possible existing post-apocalyptic-future-of-doom-movie. "italians" and "rip-offs", two words that go together very well.

first off i want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars i rated it. i gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all. however, "the big alligator river" (the title my dvd calls it) is better than your average nature strikes back movie.a tourist resort in the jungles of southeast asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around. mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god kroona, a giant alligator. but the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too.this movie is a pretty well-done adventure/horror story with a good musical score and direction. but the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is obviously fake looking. some of the close-ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see. some of the underwater far-away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky-toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop. but the natives are believable, if not authentic.probably not the movie that will give you non-stop thrills, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention. and like a lot of creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count. it also has lots of good jungle scenery. acting is below par though, but who was expecting it to be better, eh? much, much better than its recent american counterpart "primeival" but nothing to be compared with "jaws". but remember it may not be engaging at a few points.

let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970's. seriously. this one was downright awful.there are way too many elements that martino tries to inject and none of them work (except for the croc-gone-wild thing) very well at all. there are some ignorant westerners, of course, who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. i don't even remember where it takes place...how sad is that... basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' ceremonies but eventually they upset the 'alligator god' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage, killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well. sounds good, yeah? well, don't get your hopes up. there is minimal violence until the end, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable.there is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking. i'm not kidding. in another wonderfully crafted special effect, a matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator, who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van. (a few minutes ago, he was only big enough to eat a human, but now he dwarfs a full-size cargo van...) it is really pathetic. the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno mattei's masterpiece, "rats," what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who couldn't be terrified.normally i'd say anything sergio martino was a solid must-see but this one is a must-pass. waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $15+ sticker price from no shame. this one is a shame.2 out of 10, kids.

this one is bad. a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it. a series of crimes, the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie, the classic investigations. and also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what's going on and isn't believed by anyone, so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth. not too much in this one. vote: 4 out of 10.

this is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions all around, but which is confused and disjointed in execution.garcia stars as john berlin, an l.a. forensic detective who has moved to a small california town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there. he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in. the known victim is theorized to be blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind.despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where i found myself wondering, 'how the hell did we wind up here?' or 'how did we find this out?' i found it confusing and disjointed, despite the good acting, etc. john malkovich has a small part toward the end as an f.b.i. investigator out to get berlin.not recommended.

the thing that stands out in my mind in this film (sadly) is the introduction, where john berlin (andy garcia) is driving into town. you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees. it's quite beautiful. as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin, well...andy is just too hispanic/latin for it to be passable. maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story? who knows. but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry. yeah, i know, big deal right? he's still a good actor.the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer. all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them. the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness (don't ask) appears, helena robertson (uma thurman). thurman does a good job of playing a blind person, to my surprise. when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt. freddy ross i got worried. henriksen's played in some pretty strange films, especially of late. i still can't forget him in the bloodbath movie, pumpkinhead. berlin movies into a small town from l.a. as a detective. he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill. his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far-fetched. so did the irony of *spoiler* freddy's murder, with the recording and name similarities. i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight "jennifers". and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn't pack much of a punch. in retrospect, this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons.john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia! albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out. as to the ending, it is a bit of a surprise, but is highly arguable, much like sgt. ross' murder. the killer chooses to walk after his running victim, opting instead to frolick i guess.and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it's ridiculous. i won't ruin the very end because despite it's shakiness, it's a good surprise. afterward though, you'll probably say, as i did, "boy was she lucky!" 4/10

the lowest score possible is one star? that's a shame. really, i'm going to lobby imdb for a "zero stars" option. to give this film even a single star is giving way too much. am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station? and the acting, or should i say the lack thereof? apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town. my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been...oh, wait, no,no, it's already as bad as it can get.

the plot is about the death of little children. hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. in the end the serial killer get caught. that's it. but before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. it is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including hopper. i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. just don't watch the movie. i've warned you.

***possible plot spoilers***i adore dennis hopper. i question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000's the spreading ground. this movie flat out sucks and i'm about to tell you why.this is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena. one hitch: there's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business. the mayor makes a deal with the irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court. det. ed delongpre has other plans. he wants this guy caught too, but he's on the level and believes in the system. he wants to see the system do it's job.that could have been pretty good. it could have been riveting. it was horrible. first, they label this guy a serial killer. err no. there are specific criteria and none of it fits here. the bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day, and i think it was 2 the second day. this entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period.... hardly serial killer action. i don't care what warped motives they give him in the end, serial killers do their deed over a long time span. they do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days. that's a spree.ok that irritant aside, the acting was atrocious. the only name here was hopper, and he's the only one who came even close to pulling off his part. unfortunately, he's kinda type-cast to me and i think he does psycho parts much, much better. this just wasn't a good vehicle for hopper. it didn't allow him to do what he does best, which is to act all creepy. it's not that he did bad, it's that i've seen him do so much better.the irish mob guy, johnny gault (tom mccamus - long day's journey into night), who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff. contradiction? not really. he is trying to play the cold, hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden. boring to the max. he didn't scare me. he didn't inspire any emotion at all except boredom. i cannot tell you how many times i checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie.the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made-for-tv movie. you know what i mean. the poor production values, low budget, re-use of scenes to save costs. just eh. yanno? but, i feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those.derek vanlint was both the director and cinematographer on this project. he bit off more than he could chew. i can't help feeling that hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend. that's the only rational i can come up with. this was vanlint's first job as director, third as cinematographer. hopefully this was a learning experience for him.i won't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one, but i do want to say that they all dropped the ball here...even hopper. in a scene that should have been emotionally gut-wrenching for the detective, it was just..well.. blah. i didn't see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear-change this guy made. very disappointing.this 100 grueling minutes long and rated r for violence and language. no kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this, so no worries there. it's not suitable for anyone anyway. heh.skip this one. you'll thank me later.

maybe i've seen one too many crime flick, or maybe i don't take the right drugs.this was the most cliché ridden, plot deficient, plot-absurd, just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time.as for the direction, it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together.in fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed.it's a bad rip off of "m" the classic fritz lang film starring peter lorre. you'd be so much better off renting that instead.

this movie kinda let me down. it seemed a lot like the movie jaws when the hopper was telling the mayor to close parks was like when roy shider was telling the mayor to close the beaches. they both said no way its summer! but the box says hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one. but he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting. i'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case. they just say lets do police work and we'll solve it. and whats up with all the old men with pool cues. i didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses. and then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer. with his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his di@k is the size of a schoolbus. come on what cruddy lines. i thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. i got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new. i suggest you skip this movie. oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.

the movie had a good concept, but the execution just didn't live up to it.what is this concept? well, story-wise, it's "dirty harry" meets "m". a child killer has begun terrorizing a city. the lead detectives (dennis hopper and frederic forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. the mayor and the police chief, in desperation, secretly hire the local mob to speed things up...to go places and do things that the police wouldn't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible.to be fair, this film does genuinely have some good things to offer.besides the concept, i liked the look of the killer's hideout. norman bates has his basement. this guy has an eerie sewer. in some of the shots, the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a creepy, dreamlike quality.the acting was good too. dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age.once you get past that, however, it more-or-less goes downhill.the film is paced way too fast. the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating. this could have been fixed in two ways: either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots. either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery.for an example of how bad this is, one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this: at one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop...that's right...i'm being totally serious here. it's like they went from point a (the first clue) to point z (the suspect) and skipped over all the "in-between" steps.then there's the characters. the only ones i actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie. considering that they're minor characters, i'd call that a bad sign.finally, there's the mob angle. this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i coughed up the $3 to buy the dvd in the first place. i mean, what a hook! there's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years. the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest..., but it didn't.i figured the gangsters's methods would be brutal, but fun and thrilling at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something...maybe they'd even throw in some heist movie elements too. we are talking about criminals, after all. instead, we're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid. the detectives question witnesses. what does the mob do? they interrogate and kill them. it's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either. i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they're hunting.unless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest, i'd say give this one a miss. maybe some day, they'll reuse the same story idea and do it right. i hope so. i hate to see such a good concept go to waste.

dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time, and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer. most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree, but in this movie, hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield. once i got into the plot of the movie, i was hooked, but it's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film.the concept of the film is great - not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer, but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer. the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous, but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt.that's about all that is good you can say about the film. although hopper did try to act like a tough, experienced street smart cop, i can't help but feel his acting was below par, and there wasn't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case. the directing was also terrible - it didn't have the feel of a true film, but rather a tv-movie production. this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down. when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion, the acting was weak, predictable and terribly unexciting. that's when i knew that 1st of all, the action is going to be atrocious.the angling of the camera was amateurish, and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer's little sister had no true distinctive effect. if it was supposed to be scary, it wasn't. everyone's acting was terrible, and even for hopper, i didn't feel for his character, and i just didn't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter.the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team. once i saw the swat team in action, i was thinking, finally, something good. but i was wrong. 1st of all, the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys. that is just impossible. 2nd of all, apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka4 submachine guns with one hand. had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun, these 4 idiots would've been blown to bits because they weren't even aiming at anything or paying close attention. they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward, but it just looks like they're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around. 3rd, swat team members do not yell out commands such as "keep your eyes open, watch out for yourselves, are we good to go...etc." in reality, they use hand signals or have radios. but they're literally yelling at each other - how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you're coming??? and to top it all off, these guys have no plan - apparently they're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase. eventually they end up doing nothing. that was the last straw. i'm no expert on special forces, but basically what i've just outlined, is pretty common sense. when the audience knows the movie is terrible, the action pretty much becomes the life-saver of the movie - when you can't even make an effort to make the action great, the movie is lost.i give 2 stars for the concept, but the rest cannot be credited. if you want to watch a crime thriller, don't bother with this one. there's plenty of crime in the movie - but it has the lack of thrill.

very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check. a veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family - check. mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something good vigilante style - check. a sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check. cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods - check. a corrupt cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together - check.slow motion and/or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't - check. a serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail, esp. using childhood abuse as the reason for everything - check. a child spree killer that is very, very non-menacing - check. foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion - check. morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check.recently saw this on tv and decided to endure it because it had dennis hopper in it and i could not sleep - check. realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling - check.

the best thing about this movie was, uh, well, i can't think of anything. this was bad. the script was especially bad. the technical concepts were bad. the "suspenseful" plot was bad. the dialog was bad. avoid at all costs. do not rent. do not watch. you'll be sorry.

my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile. the movie is not supposed to be funny at all, but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever. first, phillippe (i forget what his character is called and i don't really care) uses his regular employee id to go through all the top-security terminals. not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary lego-room, which hosts the super computers. this is plain funny. the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room. the ending, like all else, is very very very cheesy, especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up 'right on time'. anyway, this movie is a good laugh. if you need something to make fun of, definitely see it.

five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before. it is boiler room. it is the firm. and it is the devils advocate. and there are no new elements here. except for the all-to-clear bill gates-allegory. conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, but why does it have to be so extreme ? boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. in antitrust everything is wrong. how realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? i'd give it 1, but the soundtrack is ok, so 2/10.

after seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. but when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss. patiently i waited for it's dvd release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing. the anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. for a start the direction is appalling. there's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. i wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. secondly the lead role is completely miscast as ryan phillipe. phillipe normally the cool character as in cruel intentions and way of the gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right. the female stars, rachel leigh cook and clare forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. the only highlight of the film is tim robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. the final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the dvd. causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story.

this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of "they saved hitler's brain" the worst movie i have ever seen period. when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with. the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy. the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness. the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor. the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street. the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness. the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering "there is no difference" with a french accent was, well you get my point.the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute. this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high. well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's. if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine. there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie. of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was.

stephen feinberg, who played the proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, passed away in early 2006. i met steve in portland in 1993, it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in hollywood years earlier, working mostly on tv promos. he asked me not to see 'tunnel vision', but it was too late, i had seen it already! actually i had seen it years before, when it was released. at that time i didn't think it was that bad a movie. however seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated. steve admitted it was not a very good movie. that said he was just a little proud of 'the proctologist' sketch.

saturday night live, national lampoon, and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film.however, it is very interesting to watch now, at the start of 2005. twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true: there is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something called "the pregnant man" which came true with arnold schwarzenegger's dumb movie "junior" there is a commercial spoof, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something featuring sammy davis jr. and jackie onasis called "celebrity wrestling" which has now come true with a popular show called "celebrity boxing" there is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, that features john candy in a movie about a severed head. watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to frank hellenlotter's basket case!! and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about "a dead dream, the only two left ..." the name of the documentary is ... the last hippies! lol.four prophecies come true!

when i rented this i was hoping for what "reign of fire" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.instead i got a standard "monster hunts stupid people in remote building" flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. bad, bad, bad.only reason why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies. in theory.....

seriously, i've read some of the reviews on this film, and i have to ask, were you people watching the same movie.yes, i give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate 1930 vintage los angeles, but so what? none of the characters are likable, the story seems aimless, karen black is simply not a very good actress. donald sutherland is just icky. (and his character "homer simpson" makes me wish for the animated version. d'oh!) then you had the creepy child actor, the creepier billy barty, and so on.this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go, "what the heck!"

friz freleng's 'speedy gonzalez' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after robert mckimson's 'cat-tails for two'. in that cartoon, speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. despite looking significantly more handsome, speedy never developed into much of a character. a big hat, tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make and that's pretty much all speedy ever had going for him. nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio's latter days. while these early speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) paired up with daffy duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. in this self-titled episode, speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by sylvester the cat. although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. his personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. this was always a problem in the tweety cartoons too but speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. poor old sylvester would be forced to appear alongside speedy for many years to come. despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, 'speedy gonzalez' won an oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born.

lynn hollister, a small-town lawyer, travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny. (yes, lynn is a man despite the feminine-sounding christian name. were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that john wayne's birth name was "marion"?) hollister at first believes johnny's death to have been an accident, but soon realises that johnny was murdered. further investigations reveal a web of corruption, criminality and election rigging connected to boss cameron, the leading light in city 's political machine.that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller, possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941. it isn't. "a man betrayed", despite its theme, is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama. hollister falls in love with cameron's attractive daughter sabra, and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements.this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama. one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer, but he couldn't play a cowboy in every movie, and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass. where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant impersonator. romantic comedy just wasn't up his street. one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them, regardless of whether it was up their street or not, and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could.that said, not even cary grant himself could have made "a man betrayed" work as a comedy. that's not a reflection on his comic talents; it's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film. i doubt if anyone, no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be, could find anything to laugh at in it. the film's light-hearted tone doesn't make it a successful comedy; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else. this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. 3/10

one wonders how the script came to be written.wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy, romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile. it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war. i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.nonetheless it has historical value.

i really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them. they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (remember "candy"?). the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. the story here has a european sci-fi film called "dragonfly" being made and the director is fired. so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (jeremy davies) to complete the picture. they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she's barely in it. film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law (barbarella). gerard depardieu, giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well. i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties. if any are reading this, "make it as sexy as you can"! i'll be waiting!

from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper. "cq" tells a lame, disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a babe, and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick. i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making.

i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans, but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie.i don't understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else did,if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards.most fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up baby.here the director or writers try to rehash the idea,but it fails miserably.i've read comments about how "creepy" drake was,but i thought that was far too mild a description. franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungover.a casting disaster is one thing.this film is a total disaster.this one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and i don't know why that's a requirement.too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults.unless you want to torture someone,give this one a wide berth.

stalker is right! girl sees guy, girl wants guy, girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him, girl won't leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can't stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying, girl still won't leave him alone. played right, drake's character could have been charming but she's completely, wholly, unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant's character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, drake's attempt at playing, "charmingly screwball" comes off as, "disturbingly demented." grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as i've ever seen from him. the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim.screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt, it just stinks. worse still, drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order. she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic.

one-note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge. department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage, pinning her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant. the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry. i guess the word "perky" just about sum's up drake's approach to the role. she does have a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, i began to overdose. grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. there is one scene, however, that almost salvages this slender exercise. drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies. here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable, and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes, the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day-dream, circa 1948.

heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas: it's desperate to teach us a civics lesson, and it won't stop until we've passed the final exam. fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), have a spat with their senator (eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace. henry wallace!! a year later, he was considered a near communist dupe, but in 1944, he was a-ok. add in some truly awful musical moments, a whole lot of flagwaving hooey, and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters, and you've got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2: d.c. boogaloo. drastically unfun, heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.

half past dead, starring steven seagal in the main role was a major b-hit. half past dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. it's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. but it's although worthy a look. if you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former wwe stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels, even if they are direct or not.kurupt did a good job, bill goldberg was below the average, i think he isn't made to the job. kurupt is a good comedian, i say. the rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing far from alright.technical details, well, a production made by sony can't be great. cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. whatever, just watch it if you want. if you watch, you won't lose anything. but if you don't... well, you won't lose either.

for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to twitch in the original movie, heres your chance, and then get back to the real world.the guy who hid the gold in the first movie told twitch, so he gets transferred to another prison, where wrestling champs hang around looking broody. twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman.then something happens and someone gets shot, and the film turns into die hard in another prison. but the wrestler's daughter is caught up in it all, so he and twitch go to find her and twitch's woman.as you can imagine, the acting is below par, it features a lot of (really annoying) rap music, and poorly edited fight scenes. on the plus side, it's got that hispanic bloke in it, who stars in every prison/action/thriller ever made, and he shuts a door in this.it's not very eventful, but at least it's harmless.if you were a massive fan of the original, it's okay-ish stuff.if not, you have been warned.

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning long time inmate twitch (kurupt) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened alcatraz. he claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. there he crosses paths with burke (bill goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke. but the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, cortez (robert madrid) takes twitch's girlfriend and burke's daughter hostage.steven seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a dvd sequel, the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg (steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.) but there's a reason he hasn't done much work since universal soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners. support wise, veterans from the first film, kurupt and tony plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.this is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. it does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **

i can't believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes. it's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with "you cannot force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk"... from a woman's point of view, the movie is a let down. it sort of "throws a bone" to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. this amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. she never even makes them apologize - rather, she seems apologetic. overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as hero by a long shot.

when i rented "unhinged", i was expecting a gore movie. the box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release (i now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater). after finishing the movie, i wondered how it could even receive a video release.the plot is as follows: a group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree. these women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion, which contains an extremely sexist woman. beyond this point, the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release.one of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting. lisa munson, who plays the main character, looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards. the others acting is bad, but not nearly as bad as hers. another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. this gets very annoying as the movie progresses. on top of all that, there is very little gore, which makes the box very misleading. don't waste your time on this one. my rating: 1 out of 10

i normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. however, in this case, i feel i must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. i just finished watching it only five minutes ago. this is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life. the acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. i know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. there is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! the grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. while it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. the movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. what happens? to put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. all three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. as i said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like i was by the misleading box art and movie description. save your money and your time.

i bought this movie for $5 at a used cd store, and i kinda regret it. i'll start by saying i'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks. they provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment. this movie entertained for the first half hour, because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an mst3k style manner quite easily. then it got boring.the acting is the scariest part of the movie. while great acting is not to be expected, this was laughably bad and, honestly, provided all of the entertainment that was to be had. this is the plus side to the movie. where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing, lighting, and the editing.this movie provides way too many "what the %$@# is going on?" moments. there are many moments, such as the mother having strange fits at dinner, and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie. along the lines of dinner, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served. during the meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside. then cuts back in. and speaking of darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate, where apparently it isn't nighttime unless it's raining. and speaking of darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit you can't see what's going on half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything. in one of the climactic scenes, you can't even tell what you're supposed to be seeing that's so shocking.and when it comes to climactic scenes, unhinged contains one of the worst. i've seen people say "wow, that surprised me, and that's good." i can say that the big reveal did surprise me, because i didn't see it coming. the reason i didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense. i won't ruin it for you, but i will tell you that my friend and i spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all, and all we found were more things saying that it wasn't possible.all in all, this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it. i love crap horror movies, but this was too much.

i, too, was fooled by the packaging. i, too, fell for the gory packaging and the dvd casing that claims "grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves". though it was inexpensive ($6.99), it wasn't really all that worth it - no scares, and very limited gore. the ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have. i really don't even know how it became a "video nasty" with how very tame it is. the story drags, the characters are obvious amateur actors...it doesn't live up to the promise. the dvd bonus feature (the "interview")is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there. the lead actress talks like she's appearing in a shakespearean production. it's a great laugh.

basic slasher movie premise, 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family. yawn.watching 36 minutes of a premonition of oj's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. yawn.old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter... yawn23 minutes of watching the actors eat - yawn trying to identify what the heck they are eating ... ok there might be a drinking game here ... nope - yawn complimentary shower scenes ... ok got my interest for a couple of seconds.completely random and uninspired killings ... yawn the ending ... dude! that psycho is deranged - why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes... unfortunately that is it - my advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player - for me i am going back to sleep.

"unhinged" is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. it's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. it's plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. on top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins. as far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. none of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the "lead" girl. it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. the mother and daughter are better, but not much. the film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. the killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen before. however, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic "sleepaway camp." unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. the isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act. it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10

i bought unhinged because i got suckered by the gory picture on the cover. if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box. all the kills are shown and i can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie.having said that, let's look at the plot. a group of college girls driving to a rock concert (by way of the deep, dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) slide off the road. no visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film (or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began).the two remaining girls wake up in a big, isolated house. the house, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film. for some reason, though, this house has no roads going to it. the only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods. the girls spend the rest of unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch (who looks like george washington in drag) and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. the girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of gilligan's island for that three hour tour.by the time we, the viewers, get to the kill scenes, we no longer care. we wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film. it's almost as though the ending, the one good idea in the film, was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it.unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting, inept directing, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film (sorry. i'm not sure where that came from). you will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when, for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering. don't waste your time. you'll just feel unhinged and want your time and money back.

banned as a 'video nasty' in the uk, unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety. however, the most shocking thing i found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments. the bloodletting i could handle: the terrible acting, shoddy editing, awful direction, lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take.three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm. they are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. the owner of the house, a batty old lady, and her spinster daughter, welcome the girls in, allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recuperate. however, someone doesn't want the girls to leaveever! one by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant.taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film (and that takes some doing), unhinged is a truly awful film. the music is a total mess (it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser) and as such, it complements the movie perfectly. only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save unhinged from getting the lowest possible score.if you are a horror completist (and unfortunately, i am), you will want to see this in order to tick it off the video nasty watch-list. but be warnedit is really, really bad.

i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local dvd rental outlet mentioned it to me; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the u.k., i decided to check it out. the film turned out be a dull, amateurish and ugly-looking ride; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time, whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept! what’s worse, the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings. soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again; another, still bed-ridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the duration). the heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a bible-thumping mother (cue horrendous overacting), her repressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother (as a means of filling in the dreary, to say nothing of unoriginal, backstory) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests, the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time...

unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend. pretty young girls in peril. i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road-trip shots, you actually think for a second there's going to be quality in the production. watching "unhinged" was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it's warm-up. some of the most awkward, badly lit, overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose. i wondered why they didn't just put the cue-cards on camera so the actresses wouldn't have to constantly shift their gaze. the two main girls were obviously chosen for their t&a factor rather than talent. laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry. two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill. janet penner and virginia settle as the crazy/creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever. long pauses, weird expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films. the scenes shift suddenly with long black-outs you could drive a mack truck through. cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky. eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer. but ya know, it grew on me. i felt sorry for it. i wanted to hug it, kiss it's boo-boos and make it better. the ending doesn't make up for the damage it's caused but i grinned anyway. i have my own theories regarding the whole "banned" hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor. otherwise pass.

i've never really considered myself much of "student" when it comes to watching films, i watch them, form an opinion and that's it. but unhinged changed all this. this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i've ever seen. every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled "how not to make a film". not only is there no story to be had, the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching. it's been a while since i saw it, but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes. they are never ending! it's almost like having your teeth pulled, only not as much fun.

ever watched a movie that lost the plot? well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.where to begin? the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. what do they do? slide down and run like the rest of us? no, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.it really is only a movie as they say..

twist endings can be really cool in a movie. it's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think. then we've got twists like this film has. twists that, whether or not you pay attention, you have no clue what's going to happen. when they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. this film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist.three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods, and hit a tree trunk. they end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion (laurel munson). strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.this film is too caught up in it's dialogue, and it's always between only a few characters. we have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. to make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. it's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. we want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing).plot holes are abundant here. the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! a two hour or less walk will kill them. why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? did he have a one seater? how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? why did this have to have so many dumb twists? maybe the answers are in the boring script.having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea. it's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely out there, but undoubtedly dumb.my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 mins. r for nudity and violence.

unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the 80's. keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children, don't you know! it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about. by today's standard, unhinged is a tame little fairy tale.3 girls are off to a jazz concert... and right away, you know the body count is going to be quite low. they get lost in the woods, & wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it's laughable. they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house. one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs. then there's talking. talking about why the girls are here, and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn't like it when someone is late. and more talking. yakkity yak. some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls, and someone's eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcock's psycho. i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film, that you wonder when the killings are going to start. in fact, one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods, alone, looking for the town. smart move. she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part, but just didn't care. more talk continues after this as we wait, wait, and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed.and then there's the twist ending. the "expected" unexpected for some viewers, for others a real gotcha. quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this. i don't care how twisted it is, nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it. even with the minor impact of the ending, the director just didn't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it. it would have made a much better 30 minute - 1 hour tv episode on say, tales from the darkside.if you really must get this for any reason, perhaps just to say you've watched every slasher movie, do yourself a favor and have the fast-forward button ready. since the movie has so many unimportant scenes, just zoom through them, and in no time, you'll get to the "wow, that's what it was all this time" ending. oh and halfway through the movie there's a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo-bees. horray for boo-bees. those beautiful buzzing honey-making boo-bees.

this movie was banned in england? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since...this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80's horror film. good looking girls (who can't act to save their lives, by the way), a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour, a scythe, a crazy brother wandering around the family estate, and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end. but banned? seriously. when the english parliament banned this movie, the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were.there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore (which was greatly underdone). there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned.i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. as it stands, the film is entertaining, but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result.banned... what a joke...

i tried to like this slasher, like i try to enjoy all slasher films. i mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong. but unhinged i think is an example of that formula going wrong. the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house. it was as if they were under sedation, and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight. the film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction saps it of those, and leaves the movie pretty dull. it's a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have have been ace. the story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls, and the daughter in the old house. there's some good nudity, and occasional splashy bloodletting, just not enough to give the film the kick it needed. the finale is pretty twisted and fearsome, and does give the film a big lift but sadly, its too little too late. so, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure slasher films. there's a fair amount of potential, but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile.

if one sits down to watch unhinged, it is probably because its advertisements, video boxes, whatever, scream that it was banned in the uk for over 20 years (as virtually every video nasty does). it's true; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy. being an exploitation fan, however, none of this was new to me. the advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the uk don't necessarily make me want to watch it; in fact, the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid british censors are. how i came to viewing this then is simple: it promised gore and it was only $6.99. the price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween, but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts. i did force myself, however, to watch it all in one sitting, because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it. so anyway, after 90 minutes of unhinged, i found that i had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence. i think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique.the layout of unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s. there's unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore. that's about it. anyway, it starts with a group of three attractive co-eds crashing their car on the way to a concert. though two of them (terry and nancy) are okay, one (gloria) is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie. they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion (that happens to have no phone, of course) with rather strange occupants: marion is a middle-aged woman with a man-hating mother who constantly accuses marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them (echoes of psycho?). she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods, because her mother's hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house. after hanging with marion for awhile, terry (our "hero") and nancy decide they must contact their parents. despite everyone's warnings, nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone (her fate is not hard to predict). after that, we see gloria again, who is then promptly butchered with an ax. when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room, she decides something isn't right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends. that may be easier said than done, however, with crazy carl lurking around after viewing unhinged, i read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end. normally, i do not drag other people's opinions into my reviews (especially when they contradict my views), but in this case, i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention. this is because in actuality, the film crawls. normally for the slow-building tactic to work, the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger. oh sure, we see two of them get murdered, but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom. we are aware that there's a killer on the loose, but this is only focused on three times in the film; that means there's no reason to fear for the victims. instead, the film's events are explained not by the actions of the characters, but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking. if there's one thing i can assure you from watching this, it's that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious. none of this is helped by the atrocious acting. it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience.of course, i'd be a liar if i said there wasn't one part of the movie that i enjoyed. specifically, the ending was one of the best i've ever seen in a slasher film; you just do not expect that to happen. just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular. ah, i won't spoil it for you, nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow-moving film, but it definitely will get your attention. other than that, the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material, but it's not like you couldn't tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film. anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed, however; those are the only scenes of gore present. that and, of course, no one scene can save an entire movie. i normally preach the doctrine that as long as there's action, the worse a movie is, the better it gets. unhinged only grasps one part of this concept. the whole film just feels luke-warm; there's potential alright, but the director either wasn't experienced enough to make it work or just didn't know what the hell he was doing.

there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot i completely forgot. who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying. don't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100.............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny

shame shame shame on ua/dw for what you do! i was appalled. do not take kids to see this movie. the humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. certainly *we all* have read theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. dr. seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his "thumbs up" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.what a pity. spend your money on the book. if you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program. this movie is not worth a "free" ticket viewing.stick with the book. the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously. save your money - it will be on cable by saint patty's day.shame shame shame on what they do!!

an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds. don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgement.

most movies i can sit through easily, even if i do not particularly like the movie. i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre. this is the first movie i could not stand to watch. cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen--and i've seen a lot of movies. the acting is okay (myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is really annoying). the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. the plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. the "witty" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a "ho"). even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last forever. do not waste your time. i know small kids who hated this movie. if children can't stand it, i do not know how any adults can. i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. i hated it! so, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! see a good movie!1/10 stars--the lowest review i have ever given a movie.

no redeeming features, this film is rubbish. its jokes don't begin to be funny. the humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. i couldn't enjoy the film at all. although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with monsters inc, finding nemo, jungle book, lion king, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays.

dr. seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! myers proves he can't act in this film. he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. the kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea. he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. the film sure does look tacky! sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. at least the grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. was mike myers even in this movie actually? and another thing, the fish. what is with that stupid fish! first time you see him, he's an actual fish. next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! this film is a total off target wreck. good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. so please if you have the choice, watch the grinch instead of this mess.

spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. the jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are dr. seus aren't there. a very lousy way to waste an evening. my kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. my wife left and did dishes. so i finished it alone. it was the worst "kids" movie i have seen. if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. avoid this movie. it isn't funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label.

i've seen some bad things in my time. a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud; a head on collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; human beings living like animals.but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat.this film is worse than 911, worse than hitler, worse than vllad the impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwaves.it is the most disturbing film of all time, easy.i used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something.i shudder

i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.but it turned out to be the the biggest let down. a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss. it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved.how the grinch stole christmas was much better. i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked.growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .lets see what they do with horton hears a who.i hope this one does dr seuss some justice.

holy cow, what a piece of sh*t this movie is. i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie. i guess they didn't know either! i don't remember any farting or belching in the book, do you?they took this all times childrens classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a kaka joke. this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like. i have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) i don't want the kids that i know to think it is.don't take your kids to see, don't rent the dvd. i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.

when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, i know it is bad. i wanted to claw my eyes out. i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to "unwatch", if only it were possible. the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name.to mike myers, i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world. just because it worked for jim carrey, doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians.

well i guess i know the answer to that question. for the money! we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. i admit, i thought the trailers looked bad, but i still had to give it a chance. well i should have went with my instincts. it was a complete piece hollywood trash. once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. this is then compounded with, ............................yes i'll say it, bad acting! i couldn't help but feel like i was watching "coffee talk" on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth. was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman? spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either, but mr. myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie. f-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. save your money!

the sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so i went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day."the cat in the hat" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.mike myers played the cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it is fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.this film, in short is atrocious. the acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.it starts with conrad and sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. when their mother has to go to work, she gets mrs. kwan to babysit. possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs. kwan is watching a taiwanese court room, a `la c-span. she soon falls asleep, and here comes the cat.the film starts to spiral out of control. the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. he's got thing 1 and thing 2, who suddenly start trashing the house. he improvises a tv infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. and when the cat goes full carmen miranda, it's not funny. possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat.too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. if the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the cat's universe. here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.the acting, overall, is horrible. mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat, saying things like "you dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. spencer breslin is great as the trouble-making conrad, and dakota fanning is cute as sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter(accident waiting to happen). alec baldwin's slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by kelly preston. and sean hayes is mr. humberfloob, mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. the latter three are also bland.overall, if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor, cause there's plenty of it and more. save your $7.00 and see something else. as the late great dr. seuss once said,it is fun to have fun, but you have to know how. really, universal, stop! theodore's already turning over in his grave.like my mom always says, "curiousity killed the cat".- the cat in the hat * out of *****

i thought the movie was a poor documentary. nothing of substance was discussed. it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new. the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science. most scientists appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes weird. a woman said that her awards didn't matter a whole lot, only children that were helped. she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards. playing "humble scientist", are we? "i have equations dancing in my head," another said. i don't see how that explains anything to us. it hasn't covered significant effects of science on our culture. politics of science were barely touched.not a bad flick for a 10-14 year-olds. other than that, i felt it was boring and unrevealing.4/10

this movie is really bad. the acting is plain awful except michael ironside. i don't get the story. richard grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two mc-gangs. he comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian-land. at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home-town, i didn't hear that in the movie, if so it wasn't clear.richard grieco was one hell of a bad actor. stiff and ugly. he said his lines like it too. and we wouldn't talk about sean young, she hasn' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with bolt (grieco). she is awful.when i rented it i choosed between this and subterfuge with amanda pays. i choosed this one because of michael ironside was in the cast. maybe i should have taken subterfuge.don't see this unless you think richard grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses.i will soon uptade the cast-list because i have it at home. i wrote it down after i seen the movie.

this is the page for "house of exorcism", but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece, "lisa & the devil", which explains the ridiculously high rating for this, "house of exorcism." when "lisa & the devil" was shown at film festivals in the early 70's, it was a critical success. audiences responded well to that gorgeous, gothic horror film. unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time, and was considered too unusual, and not commercial enough for mass consumption. no distributor would buy it. so producer alfredo leone decided to edit 'lisa', seemingly with a chainsaw, by removing just about half of the original film, and adding new scenes, which he filmed two years after the original product! it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new, hideous additions, so technically "house of exorcism" is not a bava film. the original product is a slow, dreamy, classy production. a few minutes into the film, the viewer is jarred out of this dream world, as suddenly we see lisa, (two years older, and with a very different haircut), begin to writhe on the ground, making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like "suck my co@k", etc. subtle, huh? and the film continues like this, jumping back and forth between a beautiful, visual film, and a grade z "exorcist" rip-off. leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes, while keeping some semblance of a story intact. he failed miserably. when the choice was made to basically destroy "lisa and the devil", bava himself refused, saying that his film was too beautiful to cut. he was right, and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet. it was many years before the original "lisa and the devil" was seen again, re-surfacing on late night television. i had seen "lisa" long before i saw this new version, and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films "vandalised" in this way. worth seeing only for curiosity sake. otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague.

this movie was bizarre, completely inexplicable, and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house. i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city. i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale, though maybe not in a low budget horror flick. definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out (in my dvd copy anyway). don't attempt to understand it, just go along and watch out for the weird bits...which is everything. don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense. pretty beautiful, though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie, like say, dead alive.

oh dear. i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japan's ringu. well, i guess the u.s. made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. so, so sad. i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so i can't believe this had to happen. claudine and kris are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not have to stoop this low to make money. there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them!

silly, simplistic, and short, gun crazy (volume 1: a woman from nowhere) goes nowhere.this brief (just over sixty minutes) tale isn't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip-off of sam raimi's the quick & the dead (his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns) brought into a contemporary setting. in quick & dead, sharon stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by gene hackman) who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father (a brief cameo by gary sinise) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head. in gun crazy, saki (played by the nimble ryoko yonekura) seeks revenge against the dastardly mr. tojo (played with minimalist appeal by shingo tsurumi), who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck. the only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that tojo sadistically cripples saki with  well, i won't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it.in short, saki  a pale imitation of the clint eastwood's 'man with no name'  rides into the town  basically, there's a auto shop and a tavern alongside an american military base, so i guess that suffices for a town  corrupted by tojo, the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. confessing her true self as a bounty hunter, saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo. of course, by the end of the film saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but she rises to the occasion  on her knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending  and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher.don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher. just watch it for yourself. try not to laugh.the image quality is average for the dvd release. there is a grainy quality to several sequences, but, all in all, this isn't a bad transfer. the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times, but, again, it isn't a bad transfer.rather, it's a bad film.

chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick, the film is so annoying.....unless you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time. the "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. puh-leeze.this story has been done several times before with such films as "heaven can wait." it's also been done a lot better. too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr., cybill shepherd, ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson.at least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.

'chances are' a big mistake to see. you could know director emile ardolino from 'dirty dancing' and 'sister act' and should expect something amusing from him. but i guess i have to disillusion you. he made a really, really bad movie.according to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby. the baby grows up robert downey jr, and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, mary stuart masterson (complicated, huh?).they fall in love with each other. then appears jr former wife, cybill shepherd, and jr falls in love with her too. i guess i don't even have to mention that she loves ryan o'neil.in one of his first roles robert downey jr's on his worst. he copies michael j fox.after the 'moonlighting' shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.

predictable plot. simple dialogue. shockingly unemotional performances. but robert downey, jr. is so cute, i gave this "poor man's afternoon special" a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved.

first i liked that movie. it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. the costume designer albert wolsky did his best!!! the same as wonderful set decorator robert r. benton - this man really had a very good taste!!! but the script writers disappointed me extremely. the best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. don't like the ending. the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright. it would be ok, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. the actors were good, they were really funny. cybill shepherd was charming, robert downey jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : )))... but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. for example, corinne jeffries, played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend philip train (ryan o'neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!! it would be a good movie, if not the ending and some missed human psychology.

films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning. while there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes. the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them. in short; they're rubbish. this isn't good considering that they're the leads, and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't (not completely). it follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare. oh dear.as you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie. however, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults. first and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. the central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas). thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. this is to be expected as it stars kids, but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. the film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing. in fact, if i had to sum this travesty up in one word, i would choose 'painful'. paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole. save yourself the pain, see something else.

in 1988, paperhouse was hailed as a "thinking man's horror film." wow, you might say, sign me up. this thing is a mess. it features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2. g. headley with a bad british (dubbed) accent, and a story with no chills, thrills or spills.it isn't even interesting psycho-babble. one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun 5.the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams. what you get isn't good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. i found myself after the two hour point saying..where did my two hours go.the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious...something interesting..it seems like the producers were on lithium.even in the dream world things are boring.a short no on this one.

i would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful. if there are people who watch this piece and think that "well then jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in ww2", then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why's and 'how's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live. what more can a propaganda movie aim for? the part in which an american movie about the rothschild family is included is re-used very shrewdly here, for instance. the question of why the jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. no one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata.besides, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda. the audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up...well done.in the movie, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. the movie is kind of history today, so no need to fuss much about it actually. however, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization as well as the problems of integration. overall, fine trash.

while most of the movie is very amateurish, the kosher slaughter scene is played up, but not untrue. kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin. the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter, in which the animals throat is cut, and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. we must remember that history is written by the victors. is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were right??doesn't it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter, and the jews are still practicing it even today?

"plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms", informs one dopey would-be victim in "the seedpeople", a silly, flaccid remake of "invasion of the bodysnatchers", "day of the triffids", and about a thousand udder moovies. and why are seeds moore dangerous than plants, one might ask? because, according to the same dolt, "seeds can chase us". yes, i can remember one horrifying incident when the moocow was just a calf, being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed... yeah, right. unfortunately, the "monsters" in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets, some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds, others which sail about on strings. there's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here. for reasons left unexplained, the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra-violet lights, even though they can walk about in the daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy. as you can see, not much thought was put into this cow flop. the moocow says go weed yer garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. :=8p

this flick reminds me some really bad science-fiction movies from 50's and 60's.it is not scary or interesting,but it's dull,cheesy and stupid.special effects are laughable,all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful.don't waste your money,rent or buy something better.i give it 3.5 out of 10( i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity).

la chute de la maison usher, or the fall of the house of usher as it's know amongst english audiences, starts with allan (charles lamy) heading for the castle of his good friend sir roderick usher (jean debucourt) who sent him a letter saying that his wife madeleine is ill. once there allan finds madeleine very sick & her husband roderick determined & almost obsessed to paint her portrait. as roderick paints madeleine becomes weaker & weaker almost as if the picture is draining the life out of her, allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes...this french production was co-written, produced & directed by jean epstein & was the second of two filmed the fall of the house of usher adaptations during 1928, honestly i don't know the original novel was published in 1839, i mean you wait 89 years for a filmed adaptation & two come along at the same time! anyway, i feel that i have a bit of a problem here as i have read plenty of positive comments about la chute de la maison usher & maybe i'm not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but i have to say that it simply didn't do anything for me. i didn't like it, obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film & therefore it relies on imagery but even so i thought the story was weak, i thought as a whole the film was boring & dull even though it only lasts for about an hour & it really didn't do anything for me at all. la chute de la maison usher was made almost 80 years ago & that is literally a lifetime, the world, cinema & tastes have moved on a lot since then & i found no enjoyment in this film. i feel this film has dated badly & probably wasn't that good to start with anyway. i never felt for any of the character's, i never cared about anything that was happening & i found it all rather tedious to sit through, i'm sorry if i've offended any silent film fans out there but that's the way i felt.director epstein does an ok job, a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in la chute de la maison usher & i will freely admit it definitely has it's moments but i thought they were few & far between. shots of people's mouths moving & not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me, i didn't like the music & the version i saw kept the original french language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick french accent which was also off putting. based on the story by edgar allen poe i doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements, stick with the fantastic roger corman house of usher starring vincent price.technically the film was ok considering when it was made. you simply cannot tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try & suggest emotions or reflect what's happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft.la chute de la maison usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era, who live in caves or who are stuck in the past, for me i like my films to have a story, not to bore me & to have sound & i'm sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that's how i feel. the world has moved on since 1928 & for the better.

movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done that twice, so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. the dialog was bad. women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese, had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents. i'm still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: do i give this movie a rating of one? or two?movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done that twice, so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. the dialog was bad. women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese, had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents. i'm still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: do i give this movie a rating of one? or two?

somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing it, i'd call it anything but. the point of this movie eludes me. the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts, and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content, there's nothing erotic about this film...all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about! the title premise could have been the basis for a fun (if politically incorrect) comedy. instead, we're treated to cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake. if i want that, i'll go buy a grace jones cd.

i am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films i've ever seen. although visually fascinating (e.g. the use of colour was absolutely stunning), it was pretty boring and disturbing (see the father/son incest).what's more, music is totally absent, and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by michael nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of greenaway's films) then you can imagine what a difference it makes.

this movie was awful in the worst way: you just didn't care. you didn't care what happened in the plot; you didn't care about the characters. everyone was devoid of heart. i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more. there is far too much sex in the film. sex can be okay; it can even make the movie (hence karma sutra) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy. it was just ugly. don't see this film.

an intriguing premise of hand-drawn fantasy come to life in a child's fever dreams. however, i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer. the duel between anna's two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest, especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i've ever seen.use only for kindling.

greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. this film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. that's greenaway's big problem. he prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. technical skill isn't enough. he's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.

to borrow from dorothy parker: this is not a film to be tossed asidelightly. it should be thrown with great force.this is an excruciating mess. and i'm a greenaway fan.mind-numbingly awful"the mummy returns" has much more artistic merit

to overcome the death of his wife, an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do (at least in a peter greenaway movie): he and his son populate their home with eight and a half (one has no legs) women and embark on a sexual odyssey. this being a greenaway film, there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. in fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude. gross. besides, who wants to see an old guy full frontal? for those who are not into the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses. there is no story - just a random collection of dull scenes.

i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i don't believe there is a worse movie in the world.i hate this movie, i hate the acting, dialog, setting, writing and directing. i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell.damn this disgusting waste of time.i pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination. i pray that i dreamt the movie, and that i will never have to see it at my local video store again.burn in hell

stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, if visually striking ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. really boring, way too much male nudity (including father-son incest), and just a sort of shameless pointlessness. i will confess, however, that certain passages of dialogue, taken on their own terms, do have a lulling, haunting quality.

i dont know about you, but i've always felt drawn to 'art' cinema. the first 'art' film i managed to get a hold of was peter greenaway's "the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover", which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive. the film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque...this is what 'art cinema' was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose. life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and art expressed shows it for what it is. i love movies of all types, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, whether i agree with it's stance or no..."8 1/2 women", is a dry, clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies. there is only a very brief allusion to fellini in the film, unlike what the previews have suggested. the main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son, brought together after the mothers' death. in the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable, you can feel his pain. what happens afterwards is plain by greenaway standards, the gathering of the harem, observations on love and death, and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh...one could argue this, but i feel the movie to be shallow and pointless. and the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me. the acting for the most part if fine,...especially good are polly walker and amanda plummer(though poor mandy should put her clothes back on) what the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch. while filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboo, "8 1/2 women" is too cut and paste to be considered art, too bland to considered 'funny', and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.save your money...i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.4 out of 10

writer/director peter greenaway cements his title as the high lord of art house pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence, 8 ½ women. the film follows a wealthy englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction, as they lure and blackmail women (guess how many) into joining their personal collection of concubines.think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive, and chances are greenaway's done it. the female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of. there's the kabuki-obsessed mio, the ever-pregnant giaconda and beryl, who's got a thing for farm animals. giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she's the "half woman," get it? greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if this isn't it, then what is?the film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with japan, a continuation of themes from his snore-worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film, the pillow book. but where the the pillow book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ women just gets horny and exploitative. greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism, and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself.

this is a baffling film. the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits.greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini's film "8 1/2" but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema, greenaway is not.he has none of the maestro's lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity.he is pretentious, the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored.as for the women, only two can be described as lookers, palmira, played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal. the rest ooze with ordinariness. both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy.greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money. relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction.there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film, indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant :the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere. the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child, she in fact, gets pregnant twice, the first foetus being aborted and the second time, she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book. both men having sex with a woman who has no legs, (the half woman in the title). the beastiality that exists between beryl, played by amanda plummer, with a pig named hortense. father and son sharing women between them. women enjoying being beaten sexually. the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife.mercifully, none of these scenes are shown sexually, only hinted at.the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes. what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it, showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men.greenaway's directorial style is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over substance, a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense.greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships.

greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the world war 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. it may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new. perhaps like that other "innovator", ts eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.yet greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write. his dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, brecht. where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it's delivered. the result is tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. perhaps the well-read director could learn something from freud on humor.finally, like woody allen, greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. they speak the lines with a bored, smug air like narcissistic adolescents.this film, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious.

in one respect, it's like 'the wizard of oz,' with paris in black-and-white and the riviera in color. but it's supposedly about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence, while actually being about designer gowns, shots of the riveria, lots of big expensive cars, and music-and dancing interludes that suggest vincente minnelli on one of his off-days. watchable, but a remarkable example of desperate, dark plot material and glitzy style heading in opposite directions. (was this the model for 'the talented mister ripley? does anyone sense an affinity between jean seberg and matt damon?)

i was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's tv series "escape into night" which, though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd, fascinating and disturbing. the acting in "paperhouse" is wooden, unintentionally a joke. the overdubs didn't add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch. casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth, chemistry or conviction. as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted, consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible. out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than i could have dreamt."escape into night" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind.

jean seberg had not one iota of acting talent. like all her films, 'bonjour tristesse' suffers not at all from her looks (though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom tom wolfe gleefully, accurately describes as "boys with breasts": publicists, of course, use the word "gamine") but suffers grievously from seberg's dull, monotonous, killing voice. in all her films when had to play anger, seberg played it with grossly audible, distracting, gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations. oy.preminger's adaptation of françoise sagan's breathlessly juvenile, fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography - but then that's difficult to funk on the photogenic french riviera, and perhaps for his apt, but certainly not groundbreaking, employment of black & white for the present day scenes from which seberg's monotone narration delivers us to the flashed-back-to color past.juliette gréco has a brief moment, as a nightclub chanteuse in the black & white spotlight, delivering in smoky dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song. this moment is nowadays, in retrospect, more than a wee bit drôle. except, of course, if you're french - particularly if you're a french "68-er" longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the sorbonne - and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated france's economy: then you still believe in sartre and foucault and all such arcane, irrelevant theorists.david niven has the hardest role, having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist who's yet to grasp that life isn't all about sagan's teenybopper notions of a hip, cool, swingin', "mon copain!" papa. deborah kerr delivers her usual, consummately professional presence, convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly seberg's spiteful teenaged snot-nose jealousy (fulfilling sagan's shallow teen fantasy of the classical theme of "there can be only one queen bee in the hive"); in fact, to kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable on-screen moment.the dialogue is unnatural - i agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be "badly translated" from french; combine the unnatural scripting with seberg's incomparably dull, unendurable monotone and you can save that valium for another night. atop all that the ineptly synched post-production voice dubbing is, almost throughout, obvious and thus much more than irksome: this is especially true of the dubbing for mylène demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance.hunky geoffrey horne gets the short end of the stick here - a very good looking young man who also suffered from a less-than-lovely, uncinematic voice which, when paired with seberg's drone, yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love. (horne was, shall we say, merely adequate in 'bridge on the river kwai,' perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros william holden and jack hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted seberg).in sum 'bonjour tristesse' is pretty to look at but it's shallow, immature soap: thin gruel with suds.

this is shallow hedonism and/or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancée. is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an electra complex? who cares? all of the characters, except for anne (deborah kerr) are vacuous and vile. seberg is poor (i agree with the "boys with breasts" comment of an earlier review). the plot plodded. this predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! if you want to see great gowns and jewels on the riviera, i recommend "to catch a thief" - in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters. i like for films to entertain me. i personally don't really care where a film is set. whatever the time or place, i want a good story - comedy or drama. i also want to see some enjoyable characters. it doesn't hurt if i can relate to them. poor deborah kerr gives a typically good performance, and so does david niven in a despicable role.the "2" rating is solely for kerr and niven, and for the cinematography - the rich color scenes and the murky, foreboding black and white scenes. unfortunately, all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un-enjoyable characters. a sow's ear is still a sow's ear. consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time.

bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding.' to wit, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper. while critics love 'member of the wedding,' i find julie harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she's been in. this portrays irritating, rich idiots as in last year at marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue.in this preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not. for the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father-daughter relationship between seberg and niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. once the conflict is introduced, seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires. kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'endless love.' seberg's vacuous narration, is like something out of strange interlude - it is not good. i really wish someone other than niven was in his role. he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.in the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a harbor. bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, 'the conformist.' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain (as in black narcissus, night of the iguana, king and i, heaven knows mr. allyson, tea and sympathy, etc. etc.). really, kerr was a horrible actress. i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash, or even better, start with one.people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.

the over-heated plot of "bonjour tristesse" is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan, which became a best-seller, though god knows why. for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. don't be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg. she's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. the problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto preminger's st. joan -- seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. this movie, also by preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. it was her second movie; she was now 20. what was preminger thinking? that niven and kerr could compensate for seberg's lack of acting capacity? not a chance? seberg's character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she can't meet the emotional demands of the role. i don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check. in spite of niven and kerr, this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons.

otto preminger directs this light as a feather story. bohemian jean seberg and her equally bohemian widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty mylène demongeot. things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up. nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist. that's fine with seberg, as long as niven loves her and leaves her (as he's done with all the women in his past...including demongeot). when it appears as though she's becoming second banana in niven's life, seberg exact revenge on kerr. preminger tells the story in flashbacks from seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. the cinematography by georges périnal is stunning. the film features some of preminger's least heavy-handed direction, although he rarely allows any close-ups, which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling. arthur laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes (mostly involving bird-brained demongeot). seberg acquits herself fairly well, but niven is at his least appealing...and he shows no chemistry with either seberg or kerr. preminger really mis-steps with that casting. it's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer. with geoffrey horne as seberg's would-be suitor and martita hunt as his daffy mother. juliette gréco, playing herself, sings the title song in a paris nightclub. the great titles are by preminger regular saul bass.

warning! don't even consider watching this film in any form. it's not even worth downloading from the internet. every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. the so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film. they couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives. it's an insult to any human being. if you're looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere else.let's hope this mr. unterwaldt (the "jr." being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy) dies a slow/painful death and never makes a film again.in fact, it's even a waste of time to write anything about this crap, that's why i'll stop right now and rather watch a good film.

i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny. -great comedians - but a very poor movie! the "best" performance still did nina hagen trivia: did you realize that it the "real world" scenes (in hamburg) the cars are almost only new bmws ?? i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny. -great comedians - but a very poor movie! the "best" performance still did nina hagen trivia: did you realize that it the "real world" scenes (in hamburg) the cars are almost only new bmws ??

i've seen the first of the dwarf-movies and sometimes i had little fun watching it. there are many famous tv/comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented, in fantasy costumes, typical little episodes of their stand-up-program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with. everything was already there....nothing new to obtain. you're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb "jokes" and you always feel like their goal was to put in every comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage. there's nothing important about the story: typical fairy-tale story of rumpelstiltskin, without any importance. i expected something like that but that's nothing i could complain about. i'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story; their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didn't get it anyway. this crap is except the great appearance of helge schneider a total waste of time and money.(if you don't like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation) if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that's broad casted every friday evening on sat1 or rtl for free. i'm sure you will recognize some "laugthers" i saw last night in cinema.

there are a lot of highly talented filmmakers/actors in germany now. none of them are associated with this "movie".why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this? you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage! it's not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs, pretending to be funny. what is funny though is that the film's producer (who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch) is playing the youngest dwarf.the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying "you're supposed to laugh now!". it's hard to believe that this crap's supposed to be a comedy.many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie. i should have done the same instead of wasting my time...pain!

despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie, i really liked it. this one however. how to sum it up in one word?: this movie is (and here comes the word): crap!but let's look at it part by part: here is the plot: finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: snow white has problems of another sort: the court-jester, father of her son, has gone astray, as the super, spliss, goes to the extreme, to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair. in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi (otto walkees),who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin.the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend, where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay. yes, there are some good jokes. even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying the the dvd. believe me. the only thing, that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion, are the performances of some of the actors. that's why i gave the move 3/10. sadly, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story.for example, at one point, they even cross over in our reality, and sadly.. they don't do anything funny while being here. still, a lot of great actors in this movie: otto waalkes, ralf schmitz, martin schneider, nina hagen, cosma shiva hagen, (especially funny): rüdiger hoffmann as the mirror, helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life. maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers it's not worth the money. i even regret renting the movie.

normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie got into my mind!!! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective, it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout. another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat!!! i would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time!!!!!

i agree with most of the other guys. a waste of photons and valuable time.nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on. the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio. ("egal, ich muss eh waldsterben") this reminds of old times with rtl samstag nacht. it is hard to describe the performances of the actors, since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just "do their thing". camera is ok, plot is laughable, i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers.apart from this i yawned all the time, wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end.my 9 year old son was pleased, but then he is pleased by so little at this age :-)anyway, a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much...

after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review. this is my first ever so bare with me.first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest (with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me.) i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn't particularly thrilled either! the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing, after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality. as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in. until she adds her constantly away father to the house, due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach.in conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab!

this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. for a horror or "thriller" film and hype, it's way too tame. there are only a few tense moments in here, not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre. even those "tense" scenes weren't much. the music made them more dramatic that they actually were.there is a lot of symbolism in here, so the elitist critics label this "a thinking person's horror film." well, if they think about it, i'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did - a waste of money at the video rental store.summary: a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting. vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised.

this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics. the script is ludicrous, the acting is over-the-top, and it looks cheesy. the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary meena kumari. watching the actress, who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. her ex-husband, amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competency to execute either task well. bollywood has produced far better films.

this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description. but to me it was a bit of a let down. very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). also, nothing of any consequence was being filmed. i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part, which is different from the typical hollywood film. but this one befuddled me to no end. i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me. i still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life, i guess he succeeded. but i was looking for more. needless to say, i can't recommend this movie to anyone.

i saw this director's "woman on the beach" and could not understand the good to great reviews. this film is much like that one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. like his other films, you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog, wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten, pretty uninteresting characters. if you feel you can like this film, don't let my review stop you. i do like minimalism in films, but i feel tsai ming-liang's films are far superior. he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kang-sheng in his films. there is nothing here. i wish iu liked it, but i don't. oh, well.

i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original -- have not seen, and doubt i will. it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (jimmy fallon).fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. he's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot. not fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. and rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. but of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.

"fever pitch" isn't a bad film; it's a terrible film.is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs? that's the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and i use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film) is getting good reviews.i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny.the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film. he adapted "fever pitch" for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997; peter hedges found hornby's voice for "about a boy" (2002) and when "high fidelity" was americanized for a movie in 2000, writers d.v. devincentis, steve pink, john cusack and scott rosenberg didn't go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby's wit and humor. they made one of the best films of that year.so why does the american version of "fever pitch" go so painfully awry? the british version wasn't a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters we could like, respect and understand.but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby's work. in americanizing the story, they've butchered it, removing all that was good and unique about hornby's work and replacing it with conventional drivel.they've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy, never once veering from the wretched formula. lindsey (drew barrymore) has three girlfriends, each of whom has a distinct function. one's overweight, the second's cynical and ambitious, and the third's a romantic. want to guess how many male friends ben (jimmy fallon) has?what made "high fidelity" such fun was not only a good leading man and lady, but engaging supporting characters. in this "fever pitch," the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny. they're so insignificant, they're not even decorative. the only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it. poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey's pals in a thankless role. the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away. come to think of it, cusack would've made an excellent ben. of course, cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.there isn't a single, solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced. every plot turn is predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. ganz and mandel labor for laughs. the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow, you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy. you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch. it's almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru's formula pasted on the wall. when they got to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, "ok, the guru says this has to happen now." and, presto!directors bobby and peter farrelly don't help the film any. they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters (they hand over the v.o. narration not to the protagonist, but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park). thanks to some extremely clunky writing, we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.barrymore does cute and adorable better than most. she's as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday. but even her cuteness can't save this extraordinarily awful film. she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story. about 30 minutes into the film, lindsey tells ben, "you're funny." the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script. for fallon's ben never says anything even remotely funny. fallon is neither witty nor funny; when he does comedy, he overacts.fallon was never any good on "saturday night live." he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show. remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices? the only reason "weekend update" worked occasionally was because fallon's cohort, tina fey, knows a thing or two about comedy.actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely, if ever, are actually funny. that's true of fallon. he thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle. his stuttering, unsure-of-himself shtick didn't work on the small screen; it's lousier on the big screen.unfortunately for fallon, his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments. if you thought his comedy was bad, wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff. two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the second in front of ben's school - are painful to watch. the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability, but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. his range of emotions doesn't even run the gamut from a to b.ben has no personality or depth. often, he comes across as an oaf. and not a lovable one at that. it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him. compare fallon's performance to firth's in the british version, and you'll understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forced fallon's ben is and how wrong he is for this role. watching fallon in "fever pitch" makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher!just as "high fidelity" did, an americanized "fever pitch" could've worked brilliantly. it just needed better writers, more competent directors and, most definitely, a stronger, funnier, smarter leading man. do yourself a huge favor: avoid this rotten film; rent the 1997 british version and read hornby's book, instead.

i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren. i'm a person who they call a cultural barbarian. i hate art in any kind of shape or form. rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, horror. if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague. no one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the kind. let me give you a résumé in a few sentences. it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda. every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker. the housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist. she falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti fascist is gay. despite of this they make love with each other. at the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. the end. you want an even shorter résumé? boring... that short enough? the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the audience from this atrocity. on a side note my sister loved this movie. like i said, i'm a cultural barbarian...

not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip-off of 'misery'. however, the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me.i'm not someone easily shocked by what film-makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor.i think most people, when watching just the first ten minutes of 'hide and seek', will find themselves reaching for the remote.

... and i have seen some bad ones.i have nothing good to say about this movie. the acting is poor by jennifer tilly - as to be expected. daryl hannah does an ok job, but nothing close to being able to save this movie.the biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer resorted to the "stupid heroine trick" to create a contrived suspense. when all daryl hannah would have to do is hide, she runs out in front of her pursuer. the hospital scene is absurd. without exposing too much of what passes for a plot, i think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed. lame. very lame.save yourself some time and pick out another flick.

this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr. it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie "misery (1990)". i cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, i was relieved.this movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. and as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...so, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important.

i really, really wanted to like julian po. i think that slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read. so, i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. the premise is wonderful, and i loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. but then...? nothing! several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. one could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. but julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. then neither julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life. he says he was a bookkeeper. he says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. so what? there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose. but none of them go anywhere, because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. this might work as an allegory, if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian. i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. and poor michael parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.

seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen. they stammer and pause and stammer some more. only for really die-hard denero fans! it tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very, very low budget film made by college students. the most often used word in the whole film is "hum". the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties/early seventies though. if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other, horrible lighting (even if it is for "art's sake"), and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting, then you might like this - but you need to be really bored. i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why.

it is only robert de niro film which i really hates. it is stupid film with horrible acting (of course not de niro). for me, brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface (1983) or the untouchables (1987). i also loved de palma's mission: impossible (1996). de niro worked with palma two different times too, greetings and the wedding party. i though that the wedding party was ok too (i didn't watch greetings). screenplay is really bad and unfunny. there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time. film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a "be black baby" scene and also i don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared. so, it is one of the worst film i have ever seen! just worst. i hate that.

this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of. arrrrgh.don johnson was pretty good in it actually. but otherwise it sucked. it was over 10 years ago that i saw it, but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain. the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is. i won't ruin it for you, should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie. but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end, with a few in between. if you have nothing better to do, and you like to point and laugh, then maybe it might be worth your while. additionally, if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like, suggest watching this movie together, and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it. that's a fair price to pay, i guess.

!!!! possible mild spoiler !!!!!as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn`t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a jagged edge / joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s . it starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse " is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney ? " , but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a " lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client " type film which ends in a ridiculous manner , and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect .this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men

you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it. that would be a mistake. this is one of the most pointless films ever made. i kept waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it. its a wonder that it was ever put on video.i wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film. i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films. surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it, and a waste of anyone's time watching it. surely there are high school students who would be able to write/produce a film which as a plot.

peter sellers plays dick scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. thus, dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. it's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film. former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director, and given medak's talents in the film the ruling class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director's chair. peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain. he's probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned, so that he can keep this off his resume. franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate, with even sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible. they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it. with lines like these, i can understand any possible unease:pierre: (about to be hanged) you'll pay for this.scratcher: no, i won't. i'll do it for free.and that's one of the good jokes. it's amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago! how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well-received british tv program "a show called fred" starring sellers, milligan, and directed by the great richard lester?

this movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. but some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding, especially), and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen.the dialog was particularly distracting, and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. most of the characters were either italian-americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties, but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. toward the end i was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian, and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. but it absolutely did not work for me.another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son, born and raised in new york in the 1920's, suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent. i'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in england.i give this movie an 'a' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower grade for execution.

this is one of the worst films i have *ever* seen! it is bad, even at tv movie level standards. the plot is diabolically flawed, and the known names in this film are wasted on confused, uncertain characters. i don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad. billed as a 'psychological horror thriller' - it is certainly horrific. there is nothing thrilling about it. and it could do you psychological damage! the initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the utter shambles that followed the car-crash scene is beyond belief. no matter how hard you try, you couldn't care less about the characters. there are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from chinese philosophers, and at worst the film would actually make you go brain dead!i have purchased over 300 films on dvd, and this is the first one i'm going to get my money back on. steer clear.

i felt brain dead, i'll tell you. this is the worst film i have ever bought. (in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name). the performances are so terrible they are laughable. the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire. the script promotes that kind of tv movie, stare into the middle distance kind of acting. the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani, they have one look each, and stick to it. plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this. the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes. avoid like a plague.

even worse than the worst david lynch "confusathon", "brain dead" makes no sense whatsoever. shamefully wasted talent (bill pullman, bill paxton), bounce around like they are in a "tom and jerry" cartoon on acid. there is negligible character development. it simply starts climbing the "strange scale", until climaxing in total chaos. do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors. they are given nothing to work with, and you will be wondering what's going on throughout the entire, unbearable 85 minutes. i highly recommend avoiding "brain dead" at all costs, unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense. - merk

discovery channel/animal planet must be ashamed of themselves. this fantasy is modeled after the "walking with dinosuars" series. even though this is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. even mixing the fantasy dragons with t-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci-fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.on its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes. but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1/10. don't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong. i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.i also think this weakens the great "walking with dinosuars" series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.

i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest. the presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. hydrogen filled flying bladders? they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful. and then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. i have no problem with fantasy, just don't try to pass it off as fact. some folks will always misunderstand. all in all the film is entertaining, but i constantly found myself saying "oh brother, what a load of ....". if you want a fake documentary, watch this is spinal tap instead. or at the very least turn the sound off.

this documentary (or i should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be, when they have full enthusiasm on something like that. honestly, i hate cryptozoology. it is unscience, it just destroy it. however, something positive in this was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake, and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists, so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0. an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea: it is true that, according to chemystry, the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions, so in that case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach. there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly, and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing, so it is impossible. anyway, there is actually something worse, the idea of the platinum: this element is more difficult to find than gold, and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that. it is ridiculous, they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth, but off course at least that explain why they got extincted. probably cryptologist's call themselves scientists, but they are not. people like them say lies like in this mockumentary, and what is worst, some people buy them. but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this. those fake scientists waste their time.

let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan. however, this film is not for me. many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed. the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but fails to investigate them more thoroughly, which could have given the film some credibility. the film uses (nice!) cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life. this is combined with popular-tv-show-csi-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific, which it is definitely not. in many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched. in some cases, clues used to show dragons possibly existed, or flew, or spit fire are simply invalid. to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes. even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it, but this one just doesn't have it. bottom line: it's a pretentious fantasy-csi documentary, not worth watching.

in the autobiographical coming-of-age tale "romulus, my father," eric bana, of "munich" fame, plays an impoverished german émigré struggling to raise his son, raymond (kodi smit-mcphee), in rural 1960's australia. the major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife, christina (franka potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men. despite her highly unconventional behavior, romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him. it is, unfortunately, the good-hearted and good-natured raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (raimond gaita would later grow up to be an author).even though i admire "romulus, my father" for what it is trying to do, i can't honestly say i enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it, these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen. a serious slice-of-life drama is one thing, but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery, insanity and multiple suicides (let alone attempted suicides) is something else again.

i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at all.i'm an rpg gamer (computer type, none of the dnd tabletop stuff) but i found none of the jokes in this funny at all.some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot (tilt and zoom could've been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute) and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time.i think i laughed a total of 2-3 times in the entire movie.the acting itself wasn't all that bad, around the standard that a b grade movie should have.i'd suggest not bothering with this movie unless you're a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it.

this movie is not funny. it just takes the d&d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. all the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. the jokes are horrible and unimaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo. i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime.

this movie is just lame. a total waste of time and money. the jokes are predictable, the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about rpg gamers is not funny as well. the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a rpg game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. of course there are a bunch of losers who play rpg like freaking retards and total losers. but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. the story doesn't make any sense at all. who cares about how long a game is being played? the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what rpg is about to make jokes about it. i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.

i usually enjoy films like this. it's shot documentary style, but the acting and writing are just awful. the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so cliché, but not at all in a good way. as of typing this, i'm surprised it's at a 5.2/10 on imdb. i'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie. i suppose if that's the case, you might manage a couple of laughs, as it's always funny seeing your relatives/friends make a movie. well, in a way, i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers, directors, actors, etc., 'cause if they can do it, you can do it. although, maybe you shouldn't.

i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap. what a waste of time. beverly d'angelo and william katt? wtf? were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something?truly, a piece of unfunny garbage. the characters were stereotypical without meaning to (i think...) and wooden, most of them seemed like they were on autopilot. the so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed, i weeped for the writers.i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time, seriously. i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1, it would need to be either five-hours long or feature more kelly lebrock.

i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player. i thought i'd have a good laugh, since i've played d&d for half my life. i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was watching.finished it later, and i should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning. no, they run the gamut of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as kkk... this movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played d&d.no wonder it looks like the real d&d wouldn't let them use their game. who'd want their name attached to this?

christopher guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg-gamers. the jokes are beyond lame. not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) snl skit, much less the 87 atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel. the great william katt (greatest american hero, house) deserves much much better. one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i'll save someone such a bad experience.my grade: d- dvd extras: 2 audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer dvd-rom extras: 2 wallpapers easter egg: highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene

as a gamer, i can't say i like this film. fact is, i down right hate it. i tried to watch it as open minded as possible, but when it gets down to it, it feels rather insulting to my social group.to me, there are several reasons why.1. the characters seem unnatural. i've met lots of players, of all different walks of life. i don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film. it's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives.2. the style doesn't work. the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film. an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. while it is good looking (i.e. cleanly put together), it isn't very good.3. the dialogue feels forced, unnatural. it also seems to lack any real world context. gamers swear, i'll admit that, but we don't have tourette's syndrome.4. the humor is lacking. while self-deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i've encountered, this is less self-deprecation, and more like toilet humor. likewise, a large part of gamer humor is full of in-jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes.5. the biggest problem to me is basically this: accuracy. i don't mean rules, but instead dynamics. invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers: dorkness rising, both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game. the difference is, gamers: the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs. the gamers, where you can say something like: "huh, i know a guy like that... yep, that's definitely like gary."

i picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious "the gamers" by dead gentlemen productions (which is highly recommendable, by the way). boy, what a disappointment! the movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver. the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing. true, it can be funny to use every singe cliché there is about role playing games, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. already at the beginning of each scene you know what the "joke" will be about. but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top. there is no subtlety in this movie, if there would be captions "laugh now" or a cheap 80s-style fake-laughter track it would not make much difference. with some scenes you can't help to think "yea, i get why they thought this would be funny" but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke.

you want to see the movie "the gamers" by dead gentlemen productions. this is not that movie. this movie is not funny. it is a waste of time.all of the good comments here seem to be written by (poorly disguised) false third parties. the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interest.this movie is not a well done mockumentary. comparisons to "spinal tap" or christopher guest are insulting.the movie is so mean-spirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny. being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner, you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it.the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality.

saw a screener of this before last year's award season, didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended, but whatever, maybe for exposure, at the least, but the movie was a convoluted mess. sure, some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. there was not one person that i could connect with, and i think that is where it failed for me. sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology, wow! what a grand idea...let's see if that already hasn't been mined to the point of futility. the whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional, i can tell, and so can everyone else, no one is laughing with you though). anyways, i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least, i wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed. but it's tripe either way. boring tripe at that.

i almost never comment on movies, but i saw the 5 glowing reviews of this "movie" and decided i had to weigh in with my own review. an instructor of mine received this film in the mail, mixed in with his academy screeners (ampas, aka the guys who vote on the oscars), and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie.this film has no plot, the scenes are horribly, horribly edited (oftentimes using faux "24" style picture-in-picture techniques), and the performances (particularly the lead, who even fails at acting like a bad actress) are for the most part, obnoxious. someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction, namely, the setting up of the plot. there is no setup! halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about. the opening crane shot, which sets up some kind of murder, is never addressed, and now that i think about it, was possibly meant to be a flash-forward, with the rest of the film being a flashback, but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such.bah, i could really go on and on. at the very least, this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability.

didn't care for the movie, the book was better. does anyone know where it was filmed? *** this was my first visit to your site...just found the answer to my question. so now i look like a dummy, but i think i'll still submit my comments. and yes, british columbia is lovely ***or why they took it from its south carolina coastal setting?(this question stands) the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie. oh, i just read where i need to write at least ten lines. here's my other main issue with the film. kim bassinger was too vapid and not at all what i pictured from the book. i know, the book was the book and the movie; well not so good. i found the character in the book much more empathetic. also the book evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. while the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.

i had several problems with the movie: (1) the screenplay -- specifically, kim basinger's voice over: movies are not books; they should *show* the action rather than have a voice over *tell* us what's happening. occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works, but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script. in fact, it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over.(2) i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex carter's acting was pretty bad. that's a significant failure for me in defining jessie's and thomas' characters -- with no connection between them, it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex-deprived. if it had been properly done, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story.(3) with the book, i understood jessie's mid-life crisis. in the movie, it seemed more like just plain boredom.on the plus side, i didn't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv . . . though that thought did occur to me.

i can't for the life of me remember why--i must have had a free ticket or something--but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released. i don't remember who i went with, which theater i was in, or even which city. all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film, and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over. unfortunately i stuck it out to end, which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far. my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says "look for problem child 2, coming soon!" that was hands-down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film.the plot, if i recall correctly, involved john ritter and perhaps his wife (lord, how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind) adopting a "problem child." maybe they think they can reform him, or something. i really don't know. if that was their intent, they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest, rudest, most horrid demon-spawn ever to hit the big screen. forget damian, forget rosemary's baby. this kid takes the cake. the only difference is, we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a "problem child." however, this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed. you want to kill him through the entire film, and when (spoiler, like anyone cares) john ritter decides to keep the vile hell-child you will be yelling "send him back!" in shocked disgust (like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did).this is only the second movie i have given a "1" to on the imdb. the other was superman iv, and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse. john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3, which he was not in, came out. he said something like "the only way i would do another [problem child] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform." amen to that!i would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again. 1/10, only because i can't give it a negative score, which is what it really deserves. someone burn the original negatives of this film, please!

problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade! this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. that junior can drive grandpa's car. he can scare people with a bear. he can put a room on fire! it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth. a sequel is an even worse fate. rent chicken run instead.*1/2 out of **** i give it.

"problem child" is one of the goofiest movies ever made. it's not the worst (though some people will disagree with me on that), but it's not the best either. it's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple (john ritter, amy yasbeck) who foolishly adopts him. this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film. it's asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout (i really don't know why). but i can't recommend this film. i know i'm being too kind to it. if there is one positive thing about "problem child" is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful. ** (out of four)

i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network. there's just something about the, well, sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on. yes, you're right about the sub-par acting, the plot which only an seven year old could like, etc. but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors. then again, a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel.

i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid, and there were parts of it (many in fact) that i did not understand. i think i have seen it once as an adult, and i then understood those parts. the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all. so what kind of movie is this? is it a "kids movie"? not hardly. it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids. is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? maybe, but then why wouldn't it focus more on john ritter's character instead of junior? when a film has a 7-year-old as its main character, in order to do well with it's audience, it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd, otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them). i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office, and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market.

the first scene in 'problem child' has a baby peeing into a nun's face. for this movie, that's witty. a nasty, mean-spirited 'comedy', it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief. john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. and what the hell's jack warden doing in this mess? slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience. but never mind all that. the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me, you will want to smack him right in the mouth.

this kid is rather bad, but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn. no, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems. a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not. through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is. even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one, and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too. the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart, they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion. add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort. not sure about this character, at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. not all that good, but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week.

my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was. after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself. it didn't.i can't understand the praise given to this film. the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time.one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (like in happiness). this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing. this film might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film, because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much.i generally like these types of small quirky films (the real blonde, walking and talking, lovely and amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time. completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.steer clear.

don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "fast food, fast women." it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing, horrific acting, and even bad music. i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen. she needs the fast food.spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting...like trimming your toenails. you'd have more entertainment value.the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie.viewer beware!
