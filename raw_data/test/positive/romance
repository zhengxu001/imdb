if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, i would have told you it was great! however, i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. after thinking a little about it, i believe the problem was the pace of the ending. i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. so, i would say the ending left me disappointed.i thought that the characters were well developed. costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. yes! ashton kutcher can act! also, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. furthermore,i thought that the different plot lines were well developed. overall, it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it.in conclusion: good characters, great plot, poorly written/edited ending. still, go see it!!!

if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. it's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles. as evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. to get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. i know, i know, that's hard to do when you consider custer's last stand at the little big horn and it's prominence in the history of post civil war america. so i guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.there's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. custer's arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. the practical joke by sharp (arthur kennedy) putting him up in the major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in custer's first meeting with libby bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie (hattie mcdaniel). i hadn't noticed it before in other films, but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties, mantan moreland. so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress. with that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.as for flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed j.e.b. stuart opposite ronald reagan's depiction of general custer in "santa fe trail", both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland. in that film, reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers, while in flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. but it doesn't come close to that of richard mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's "little big man". let's just say that one was a bit over the top.the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer's character, when he stated - "you take glory with you when it's your time to go".

after working on 7 movies with director mickael curtiz (the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement), errol flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great raoul walsh. this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. the died with their boots on is their first and best film together. raoul walsh portrays the general george armstrong custer (errol flynn) from his debuts at west point, to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn. it's true the film shows a too heroic portrait of custer, but that's not important. what is important, is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. who can forget california joe, the great "queen's own buttler" with his song "garryowen", the touching mrs custer (olivia de havilland), the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy ?an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso.

i first viewed "they died with there boots on",about 1970 and though it has been many years since,this film and its impression remain.the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic.when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some.i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer,however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi-documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set.this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable.yet, there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well.custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of...34.much has been made of custer's final class ranking,but of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in 1857,half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day,june 24,1861.it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident"his squadron would follow him to hell,"your at attention sargeant,reprimands tape.if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attach√© to not only sheridan,but hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellan.there is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack ,"young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates.as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels,custers audacity shone through.he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers,including a rebel captain.yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomac.this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise."robert l.bateman-armchair general.there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer,the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes.though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the "little big horn" only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well.they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career.the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officer.he was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the means,and the information(discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lee's plans to split his forces)and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours.it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg,pa.his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with but a force of 2,300.i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion.there is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder, well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments.though custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe.the truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank.this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success.it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best.his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it.

i blame "birth of a nation" myself - for commencing the long-running tradition of hollywood travesties of history, of which there can be few greater examples than this. apart from getting the names of custer and his 7th cavalry, crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right, the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man, the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits. throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition, (try custer and his wife's learning of the phony "gold rush" to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory, custer's testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all, custer's storming into the president's office to beg to return to his post), honestly there's plenty more of the same, some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness... ...and yet, and yet, it's still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever, dehavilland as beguiling as ever, the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences. ford taught us in "liberty valance" to believe the legend before the truth. here i think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey, it's only a movie and a rollicking, wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that!

being warner brothers' second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn, general george armstrong custer, they died with their boots on (warner brothers, 1941) was the far more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with santa fe trail (warner brothers, 1940), which really didn't set the bar very high.although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn, there was a change in the casting the part of general custer. whereas it was "dutch", himself, ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant, egomaniacal cavalryman in the earlier picture, with mr. flynn playing virginian and later confederate hero general, j.e.b. (or jeb) stuart; errol took on the custer part for they died with their boots on.once again, the warner brothers' propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the "warner's repertory company" are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity, and all is really happening right before our very own eyes. major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses, such as: elizabeth bacon/mrs. custer (co-star olivia de havilland), ned sharpe (arthur kennedy), samuel bacon (gene lockhart), chief crazy horse (anthony quinn), "californy" (charlie grapwin), major taipe (stanley ridges), general phillip sheridan (john litel), callie (the bacon's maid, hattie mcdaniel). the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited, though skilled players such as: joe sawyer, eleanor parker, minor watson, tod andrews, irving bacon, roy barcroft, lane chandler, spencer charters, frank ferguson, francis ford, william forrest, george eldridge, russell hicks, william hopper, hoppity hooper, eddie keane, fred kelsey, sam mcdaniel, patrick mcvey, frank orth, eddie parker, addison richards, ray teal, jim thorpe (all-american, himself), minerva urecal, dick wessel, gig young and many, many more.the film moves very quickly, particularly in the early goings; then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years, the assignment of custer as a colonel in the 7th cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn, in montana. under the guidance of director, griffith veteran, raoul walsh, the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos. as with most any of mr. walsh's films, he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor; but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy (farce, actually).as previously mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, santa fe trail (last time we'll mention it, honest schultz, scout's honor!). however, that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of "artistic and literary license; as indeed, just about any biopic will have. it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay. perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of literary license is that business about custer's being accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general. it just didn't happen that way, yet the "gag" both helped the film to move along; while it underscored the whole light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film.director walsh and mr. flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man. and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident, being the massacre by the lakota sioux, the cheyenne and the fukowi of custer and his 7th cavalry at the little big horn. at the time of its occurrence, june 25, 1876, "custer's last stand" was as big an incident and shock to the americans' national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor (december 7, 1941) or the atrocities perpetrated by the islamic fascists to new york's twin trade towers and the united states' armed forces' headquarters in the pentagon, arlington, virginia on september 11, 2002.just as so many films of that period of world war ii (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict, such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period.poodle schnitz!!

when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland, "they died with their boots on" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. it is the sweeping saga of general custer (flynn) - told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon (dehavilland), through his tenure during the american civil war, and finally with his death at little big horn. director, raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers wally kline and aeneas mackenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. hence, the battle against chief crazy horse (anthony quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - california joe (charley grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nation's first peoples. flynn, who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold schwartzenegger to two parts albert schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. resident warner stock players, arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, "they died with their boots on" is ample film fodder for a saturday matin√©e or sunday night cooing with one's sweetheart. warner's dvd is pretty nice looking. although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. some fading is obvious during scene transitions. the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.

the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him. olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful. arthur kennedy never more villainous. anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse. it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final "last stand" which occurred on the banks of the little big horn. the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. however, i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywood's golden age.

it's true that "they died with their boots on" gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer's (errol flynn) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn. because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us-american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse (anthony quinn) in a favorable light. i'm almost tempted to say that "little big man" in its unqualified anti-custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison. further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture ¬ñ this isn't just a movie about the battle of the little big horn, it's a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet, the famed civil war hero, the indian fighter, and, last but not least, the husband.the movie begins with custer's time at the west point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. during a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, elizabeth bacon (olivia de havilland), who, like custer himself, is a native of monroe, michigan. custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away. custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg. while on leave, he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth, who promises him her hand in matrimony. immediately after the war, custer and elizabeth bacon are married.with the civil war over, custer is demoted, doesn't get a real command, and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small, professional american army. as he starts to drink, his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general-in-chief winfield scott. custer is given the command of the us 7th cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties. custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horse's cause, but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle."they died with their boots on," though short on historical accuracy, is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s got: both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors, neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated, and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming. the only minus, and that's why i can't give this picture a full 10, is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants; elizabeth's servant callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammy.it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse, but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi-criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans. just a couple of years later, the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers.needless to say that "they died with their boots on" omits the fact that custer's overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy, greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart, and doesn't mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn. nevertheless, custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station, gettysburg, trevilian station and others, though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as "they died with their boots on" suggests.in any event, "they died with their boots on" is a well-made war movie with western elements, three outstanding performers (flynn, quinn, and de havilland), and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money, which wouldn't be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come. it would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist minstrelization of african americans.

the film is excellent. one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynn's performance is superb. this is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al.i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn. the cold, calculating look on flynn's face as he does so is extraordinary - much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done.the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p. huntley jr as lt "queen's own" butler. it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor.

now this is more like it!one of the best movies i have ever seen!despite it made very well on all aspects,this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate.loosen up!there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand,how entertaining and how captivating this movie was!now this is what a movie ticket is all about!you will get exacty what you want from this movie's genre and all naysayers are those with the anti-flynn syndrome.this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti-elvis,anti-ali,anti-clinton,anti-kennedy syndromes,usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs.if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art,you will find this movie not only one of the best classics,but also one of the best movies of all time.i rate it the second best western ever, right behind wayne's the cowboys........

this movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custer's life and his last stand', do not rent `they died with their boots on'. but, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch.the story starts out with custer's (errol flynn) first day at west point. everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles, including his battle in the civil war. the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn. in between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with libby (olivia de havilland).errol flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave george armstrong custer well. olivia de havilland plays the cute, sweet libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet. their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. the acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of callie played by hattie mcdaniel. her character will definitely make you laugh.the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. the script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. the director's portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero. others will watch this movie and learn hate him.i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.

naturally, along with everyone else, i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer. just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way).yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the custer story, i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clich√©s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early 20th century.for instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life custer: 1) his initial entrance at the west point front gate, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character.2) his miserable record at west point, which seems to be attributed as much to custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid.3) custer's promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. i half-expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene.4) custer's stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.5) custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored.and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man. in fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull, but arthur kennedy & co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills. sure, that part of the story is true, but i didn't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this.and one other thing: usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. in this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th cavalry, and not the indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way.all in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk.

as a history of custer, this insn't even close (custer dies to help the indians? i am sure the other members of the 7th cav weren't consulted in that decision.) but as a western, this is fun. flynn looks, and acts, the part of the dashing cavalier. and the "garry owen" is always nice to hear!

although "they died with their boots on" is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. not only is flynn the perfect custer, the character actors are superb. besides the action portion of the movie flynn and dehavilland's love scenes are very touching and believable.(flynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life). flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!

errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west, fighting military red tape, confederates , indians and carpetbagger business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end. not to forget the ever reliable o. de havilland as lady mary of the west. never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons, it doesn't work out. just enjoy it, because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when raoul walsh and errol flynn co-worked.

the saving grace of this film is its humour. playing up to the strengths of their star, warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism; it was robin hood all over again, and flynn blossomed in the role. all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception.it also benefits from the return of former co-star olivia de havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; the part of strong-minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynn's later films, and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. in this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled -- for once, she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect.the flynn/de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability, when most of flynn's other westerns -- held in such affection by the contemporary american public, although allegedly not by their star -- have long since been forgotten. the action scenes are fairly cursory (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy-fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. it cuts down on the cast list, but it's a trifle too morally convenient.however, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players (memorably including anthony quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the sioux leader), errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal: charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash-point indignation, cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma. he's a reckless braggart, but you can't help but like him. and it's hard to go away without the tune of "garryowen" threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter.this is one of flynn's lasting hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.

this is awesome!!! there is no partnership quite like errol, and olivia. there love is genuine! i'm 24, yet this flick is as captivating now as i'm sure it was 60 years ago. raoul walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between colonel custer (flynn), and his wife (de havilland), almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24yr old guy!!), its so heart-wrenching. there is also a deep christian message implicit here, the faith custer has in taking your glory with you, and the trust, and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go, in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american, and military history, from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. i knew errol flynn was a star, and de havilland was a screen legend-this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest!

george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn. "they died with their boots on," paints a different picture of general custer. in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes, and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure.errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point. custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments. in spite of his poor standing, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army. through an error, custer receives a promotion in rank. before this can be corrected, he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates. his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero. custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, libby who is played by olivia de havilland. libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry. custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans. to prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with crazy horse, the leader of the sioux . when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills, custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers.errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. olivia de havilland's depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife. the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland. anthony quinn as crazy horse, sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott , arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining.the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. while it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. the movie has a little bit of everything. it has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a large variety of audiences. the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact. the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land.

whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac, debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day. they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others.he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general. his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance.it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century. libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn. what's not known to today's audience is that libby survived until 1933. during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend. by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way.i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback. olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime, and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance. even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing, but if done from libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven.sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott. the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer, he was retired and replaced by george b. mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point. i'm not sure they ever met. but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott. a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers.the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, errol flynn and olivia dehavilland. this was the last of eight films they did together. the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby's farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. both their performances, olivia's especially, was a high point in their careers at warner brothers. we know through history that custer is riding to his doom, that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy. if your eyes don't moisten you are made of marble. as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired. as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action, you can't beat this film at all.

great historical movie, will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch. view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject. my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white; wished it had been in color ... wow !

i saw this film over christmas, and what a great film it was! it tells the story of custer (played by errol flynn) during and after his graduation from westpoint. although i've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate (hollywood never is) i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway.i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor! his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp (arthur kennedy) rode to their deaths on little big horn.i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and i grew up watching his films as a child. but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was.i'll give this film 10 out of 10!!

although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer. this remains the best film made about custer. the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song "gerry owen", which was a favourite of custer is played. the film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy. the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together, and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.

this is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10. as a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10. and i think i am actually being very charitable.what was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest "boy" general in the union army of the american civil war, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes? opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, indian-foe, indian-friend(?), and national hero. his death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington, lincoln, jackson, and grant/lee, and sherman/jackson. it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined. yet to this day, george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (i can't really think of a similar one - maybe general jonathan mayhew wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march - but wainwright survived the march and the second world war). custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the western adventures and little big horn. pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film. but even in 1941 the legend was still potent. olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later. custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. john ford would have fully understood this and approved it.so we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic. although almost pushed out of west point by demerits (which was true), custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year. you see, most of the so-called military talent from west point (from robert e. lee down) was southern, and joined the confederacy. the union needed every northern "point" man they could find.custer's civil war career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of general - in - chief george b. mcclellan, and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare. but he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and sherman's buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war. in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek, which ended the threat of the confederacy in the shenandoah valley. it also hit custer hard on a personal level (his close west point friend, stephen ramseur, joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer - mortally wounded, custer sat with ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).following the war things fell apart. he wanted to make his brevet - major generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion). they only had a lt. colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier. he tried to play politics, making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot. he supposedly admired the indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of indian women and children that ended with a court martial. later, during the 1870s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the secretary of war, william belknap) who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit. it ruined belknap, and left a black eye on the grant administration. it put him into the doghouse with grant and sherman (who was belknap's former commander), and sheridan barely saved his career. then he was sent on the final big horn campaign. and immortality arrived.that career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical? should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007? would we like that done to us in a hundred years? certainly it could happen, but i'm not sure we'd like it.custer (1941 style) fit flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a "dance" performance in any of his major films. his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. in support actors like sidney greenstreet, stanley ridges, arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (kennedy). as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.

the custer legend, a la warner brothers epic. there's no casting against type here, with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute, not only to custer, but to the men of the 7th cavalry. the story traces the life of the famed 'boy general" from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn. great liberties are taken with facts here, and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates. but this one is done on such a grand scale, the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood. down beat ending and all, this is great fun!

all in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii), provided you don't take it at all seriously. the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, jfk. (this one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that it's not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) it's worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the ny times review conceded that audiences would "dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film," described the biographical account of custer's life as "fanciful," and pointed out that the presentation of custer's motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. they could have really gone overboard in building up custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational.flynn and dehavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that it's not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. with a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer, but these two make it work. the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated michael curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous year's similar-themed santa fe trail, it's understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade - both terrific - so we can't really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.)raoul walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. the interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does warner bros' outstanding cast of "usual suspects" and new faces (greenstreet, gene lockhart, anthony quinn, arthur kennedy, etc). i would have liked it better if kennedy's character had been a bit less standard (i generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as he'd only been in films for one year (walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together).various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of "garryowen" as the cavalry theme. the last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. a thoroughly rousing adventure.8 of 10

dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer. the dashing, jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless, headstrong cadet, through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians. olivia de havilland, flynn's co-star in several other films, scores as the devoted, adoring libby bacon, and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse. the film's battle scenes are excellent. the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer, seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers, hammers the confederate army into submission. custer's last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle, a savage clash between red men and white, with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men. great direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic.

i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it. i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is, and how she mostly ruins louden's perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways. as a kid in the 80's i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie, the domain of madonna's character, with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc. now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons, and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms. nikki finn. although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie. pure beauty and genius.

nicole finn (madonna) is just being released from prison. although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia, she wants to stick around the place she was arrested. this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record. louden (griffin dunne) is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law. louden will be driving around the city anyway (in his future mother in law's rolls royce), picking up the wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. nicki, however, starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving. between big cats, taxi drivers, hit men, bridesmaids, and a wedding cake with guns, lawyer louden knows he's not in kansas anymore. is there a way out of the madness? this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue. madonna and dunneare perfect foils to each other, making their connection uproarious, as they play out their roles as an ex-con and an uptight, button-down lawyer, respectively. the script is laudable in it's ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one, and the next. everything secondary, from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes, are also quite nice. if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy, rent this movie for them. you will both be cheerio pronto.

i have to rate this movie at a 10. i'm sorry but i think it's classic comedy. then, if you're rating it to other madonna movies...well, what? you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? didn't mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later? please, this movie deserves much more credit than it gets. plus, i like to think of it as an a+ sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80's. remember when you could shoplift from sam goody and cartier in the same day? remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly? so it was no "last emperor", it was still good. there are certain movies i'd be willing to watch everyday. three, actually, that pep up my day and make me smile. if you like "who's that girl?" then i'd also recommend "party girl" and "romy and michelle's high school reunion".

radio was a very good movie, and honestly, i never cry in movies. but it had me pretty close to tears. it really got to me when radio's mom died and he just wouldn't get out of his room. i felt really sad about how, if you were mentally retarded, you wouldn't really be able to understand death. i really liked the movie, and it's a must see.

i'm normally not a drama/feel good movie kind of guy, but once i saw the trailer for "radio", i couldn't resist. not only is this a great film, but it also has grreat acting. cuba gooding jr. did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy, a.k.a. "radio." ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones. i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well. so for a great story, great acting, and a little comedy, i give "radio" a 10 out of 10!

radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, was the right thing to do. the viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done. the adversity that coach jones and radio both faced was both tragic and predictable. people did not understand; nor did they want to understand. but in the end, the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened. radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little, besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature: intuition, compassion, and love. coach jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how. it was sad the way coach jones and radio met. the practical joke that terrified the life out of radio was enough to make you want to severely punish, not only the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. however, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies. this movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed. ed harris was his usual brilliance. gooding was flawless. radio is an inspiration.

'radio' is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy, nicknamed 'radio', and the football coach from the t.l. hanna high school, harold jones.cuba gooding, jr. is excellent as radio! i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance, specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies. ed harris is great as harold jones, but this actor is great, so this is not anything new.the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy, always walk around the t.l. hanna high school, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. one day, when the football's ball is throw near him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of johnny cash, one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. one day, cash decides to punish james, mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up.when coach jones discovers that horrible act, he stays angry and punish all the team, deciding for this day on to help james, who gets the nickname 'radio' because of his passion for radios in general.the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant, helping the team train despite hardships from the players, and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. it has a life lesson,specially showing us how a person can make a difference, even not being what we call ''normal''. radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone, and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives.

can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a south carolina town? the answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap, james kennedy, understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene. also, the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience coach jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart."radio", directed by michael tolllin, is a formula film inspired on a true story. yet, the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast.coach jones is instrumental in getting the young man, who is called radio because his passion for collecting them, involved in sports, a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life. coming from a poor background, radio, lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions. radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot, at first, then, his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body.the film owes a lot to ed harris and cuba gooding jr. who make a great pair as the coach and radio. mr. harris, one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence. he gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past. cuba gooding jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man.the supporting cast is excellent. s. ephata merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does interesting work as the mother of radio. alfre woodard, another good actress plays the high school principle with style. debra winger, only has a few scenes in the film."radio", while being sentimental, will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them. michael tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us.

ed harris and cuba gooding jr. where cast perfectly in this film. it's a heart-warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care. i think there was a lot of realism with the characters. the screenwriter didn't incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do, which i thought created a more realistic story line.writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard. there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously. ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach, realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio.

unfortunately, due to a sluggish start, i can't say that this is one of hitch's best films. it very excellent none the less. the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back. they both give excellent performances, not surprising of course. really, however, i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music. the climax at the opera house was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius. absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. also, the use of doris day singing "que sera, sera" was excellent. especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film. so, this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date. unfortunately it had a slow start, or i could have recommend this film a little more highly. even then, it is still well worth a look. 8 out of 10.

this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film. james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie. bernard herrmann appears as himself near the climax.the scenery and locations are great, except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake, which doesn't make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots. i've heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes.the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie. very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end.i rated this movie 8 out of 10.

some people say the pace of this film is a little slow, but how is this different from any other hitchcock movie? they all move very deliberately and, as a point, have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it. this movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful. the albert hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema that exists in hitchcock's collection (the best probably being almost all of "rear window"). pure cinema for hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue, in order to tell the story visually. this is, of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence, as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture. not many slip-ups by hitchcock here, and the acting is superb especially by doris day in a rather surprising serious role.

lovely little thriller from hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original. nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.

1956's the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment. to those who prefer the 1934 original, i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier. however, even though the american version was (heaven forbid!) a big budget blockbuster, i believe it blows the british version out of the water. i think this is one of hitchcock's 10 best-no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. i find so many things to love:1)james stewart, america's favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job playing the distressed father here. he can make any film enjoyable, and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he had me rooting for him very intensely. leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison.2)doris day. yes doris day. despite all the criticisms directed toward her, i think she makes the loving wife/mother an extremely sympathetic person. i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is docile and helpless. i don't want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one, and for those who care about that this version is the way to go. and i loved que sera sera; i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard and deservedly won its oscar. it elevated the film to another level.3)the albert hall sequence. i don't think it was too long at all; i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. and the assassin was truly frightening. 4)the ending really put a smile on my face; even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. the last line in the film is highly amusing. i don't think the film started out slowly; hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job. i wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing hank, but i didn't have a problem with him. since hank was ben and jo's kid i cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything. i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. way to go hitch!

i can't believe this movie only scores 7.4! this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcock's movies such as vertigo or marnie. the only reason i can think of why the score is so low, is that for the most part, the man... renounces violence and certainly won't get a diploma in "sex and crime".what it derives its tension from is not violence, it's the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails. today, having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as mel gibson's ransom, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where family was all in contemporary america, the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot.and this tension still works for me, today. yeah, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing in how they act: it's a deal for them, and they want to be "good businessmen", disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera!! what makes the movie great, however, are the creative aspects, the kinky ideas of hitchcock, the outrageously disturbing scene in the church (which brings it to the viewer's attention how alone, how abandoned the protagonists are, nobody caring, nobody helping, the people in the church just going home...), the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals (which stresses the somewhat "oriental" flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad), last not least the role of music in this movie.music is the key principle here, as ***spoiler*** the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti/gong; so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second ***bang*** and then, of course, doris day singing que sera, which became more famous than the movie itself; she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy...all in all: a classic!!

less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo, rear window, or psycho; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest. shot largely on location in morocco and london, the film tells the story of a married couple (james stewart and doris day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot--and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence.james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all-american couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of "the ugly american abroad" about his personality; day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage, has a suspicious nature. these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence, involving what seems hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. less often noticed, although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out "que sera, sera" (written for this film) in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party.although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock's greater work, it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. it's hitchcock-light, but recommended.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

one of master director alfred hitchcock's finer films this is the story of an american and his family (james stewart, doris day, and their young son) who are vacationing in north africa. stewart is a doctor and day is a world famous singer. they meet a frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. later one, the frenchman whispers something into stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. the rest of the film is a puzzle as stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. the movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. you never really know what's going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you're not sure. the final scene takes place in albert hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog. hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.

this film is the one which you fall in love with. alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time. the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity & gripping drama. the another best thing about hitchcock's films is a definite & gripping end.any thing said about "the man who knew too much" is less. the cinematography, acting, dialogs & camera works are magnificent in this movie. the song "que sera sera" at the end shall remain in our memories for life time. the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends. rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films, this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie. this film is absolutely brilliant & as good as vertigo.

am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the 1934 english film? the english version has no suspense, looks antique and very low budget, and has unexceptional acting (except for peter lorre). the 1956 version, besides having top production values, shows james stewart as the perfect 'innocent' american abroad, and gives doris day her best role ever. of particular note is the music - the music of the american film is almost classic; compare the "albert hall' sequences of both, and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). the only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better.

alfred hitchcock's remake of "the man who who knew too much," is usually not considered to be as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. i prefer it over "vertigo" and "rear window."like "north by northwest," it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family.while the original was good for it's time, it is hard to watch by today's standards. the remake has excellent production quality, an endearing doris day, and a really creepy villain. don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over.

this isn't among my favorite hitchcock films, though i must admit it's still pretty good. among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary looking assassin (who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him). although it cost the studio a lot of money, i didn't particularly care for doris day in the film--she seemed to weep a lot and belts out "que sera" like a fullback. yes, i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner, but this forever made me hate this song. sorry.the other complaint, though minor, i had about the movie was that it was a little "too polished" and "hollywood-esque". the original version (also done by hitchcock) just seemed a lot grittier and seedier--and this added to the scary ambiance.

ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day. the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. they know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at albert hall in london.the movie is rich in hitchcockian incidents. a friendly but opaque frenchman seems to grill the innocent stewart -- a doctor from indiana -- a little too intensely to be merely idly curious. later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers some information about the murder plot to stewart. stewart tells his wife -- doris day looking very saucy indeed -- but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life.instead the couple try to track down the assassins, buy them off, and get their son back, taking them from morocco, where hitchcock has given us his usual tourist's eye view of the customs, locations, and food, to london. there is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set-to between stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. the staff are more concerned about guarding their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. in the course of the scuffle, stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill, but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger, the action boosted along by bernard hermann's bumptious score. the scene ends with stewart rushing out the door. hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion's head gaping at the slammed door. there is also a running gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in london, waiting for things to be explained.there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on. one is the relationship between stewart and day, which is not as rosy as it ought to be, considered as a bourgeois ideal. she's been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. and she's given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. that's understandable in, say, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right. it isn't delved into, but the edginess is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe dimaggio and his then-wife marilyn monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea. "oh, joe," she gushed, "did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer?" "seventy thousand," muttered joe, former hero of the new york yankees.the second problem is one of allegiance. who is of greater social value? one's own young son? or an unknown ambassador. do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the albert hall. her solution opts for allegiance to political stability, although her motives are problematic. does she scream to save the ambassador's life, or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her? (cf: alec guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "the bridge on the river kwai.") the photography is extremely good, and the settings can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of london. it's mid-day, and stewart is alone and determined, but frightened too. there are footsteps echoing on gulliver street from someone, somewhere. is he being followed? is his life in danger? and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street? hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him.the director had a rare disagreement with francois truffaut while being interviewed for truffaut's otherwise laudatory book. truffaut argued that the earlier version of "the man who knew too much" lacked the depth of the later version. hitchcock replied, "it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional. no argument there.this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenith.

"the man who knew too much" falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense by any means, but an awful lot of fun nonetheless.james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue. the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert, where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score. the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is, so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist.so much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy "foul play" that i have to believe that film was inspired by this. neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy.grade: b+

dr. ben mckenna (james stewart) and jo mckenna (doris day) travel to morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named louis bernard (daniel g√©lin) on a bus.the next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells ben a secret; an assassination will take place in london.the crooks kidnap the couple's son hank (christopher olsen) making sure ben won't reveal their plan to anybody.alfred hitchcock's the man who knew too much (1956) is a very intense thriller.the acting is superb as it always is in hitchcok's films.james stewart is marvelous.doris day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well.the song que sera, sera has an important part in the movie.this movie is a movie of many classic scenes.in the final scenes at the albert hall, done without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes.this movie is fifty years old now.time hasn't decreased its power in any way.

hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of mckenna marriage(james stewart, doris day, in the first version leslie banks, edna best) along with their 11-years-old son travelling through morocco during vacations. in a bus they know a sympathetic french person(daniel gelin, in the old version pierre fresnay). while they are in marrakech they also know a couple(bernard miles and brenda de banzie) and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing, the dying whispers a political message.then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and mckenna gets help to morocco's inspector buchanan(ralph truman).this is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by james stewart and doris day. this exciting film displays suspense, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama well written by john michael hayes and charles bennett . packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician: innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny, intelligent villains. colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in morocco and london studios by cameraman robert burks, though with excessive transparency for marrakech scenes. lavish sets by henry bunstead, hitchcock's usual, and working until his recent death. of course,the highlights are the happenings of the famous royal albert hall of london assassination where a sneering killer, reggie nalder, tries to execute while composer bernard herrmann is conducting orchestra. besides at the climax doris day singing ¬®que sera, que sera¬®, meantime her son suffering risks, the song won oscar for ray evans, jay livingstone . the story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. rating : better than average, hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it.

i put this second version of "the man who knew too much" to my top 10 hitchcock movies. together with "frenzy", it's probably the most argued film among the fans of hitchcock. i consider it far better than, say, "rebecca", which has gained unreasonably much appreciation.the film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but that's something to be expected from hitchcock. it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used for preparing the following happenings, which are full of intriguing suspense.if you can ignore the clumsy rear projections, the only weakness of this film is the main villain, played by bernard miles, who is a rather flat and undeveloped character. luckily, there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie nalder. and hank, the little boy, isn't as irritating as most kids in old movies.

the movie, which was directed by alfred hitchcock, was brilliantly made. it starts with a family of three, a doctor (james stewart), his wife (doris day)- who is a former stage singer, and their young son- my guess is about 10 years old, who are traveling through morroco for leisure. on the bus, the bump into a french government agent, and they are a little too nice to him. he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought. he wants to carry this information out to someone, so he goes to the only person he, even slightly, knows: james stewart. the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. stewart has to travel to london, because that is where his son is, and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be. the movie is very suspenseful. there are many twists and turns (typical hitchcock movie). also, it has just the right amount of comic relief. in addition to all of that, it won an oscar for doris day's performance of "que sara, sara." this movie is very good. it is hard to find a problem about it. i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. i give this movie an "a-" only because it is a little bit predictable.

"the man who knew too much" (1955) is alfred hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (james stewart and doris day) on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder, espionage, assassinations and the worst of all, kidnapping of their 10-years-old son. the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun. stewart and day have a good chemistry together. the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense. the inclusion of "que sera, sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like "que sera, sera" did in "the man who knew too much". hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin "storm cloud cantata" for almost ten minutes while scene in london's royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.

a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception - it's a remake! doris day is in it! she sings! - hitchcock's second crack at 'the man who knew too much' is his most under-rated film, and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.this is, in more ways than one, doris day's film. not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against james stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. this is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? consider: day's jo mckenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. this seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. but look at the way stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage over her concerns about louis bernard, implying that she is jealous that bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career. this is clearly a recurrent joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement, and that they both realise it.after their son has been kidnapped, stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. this is a cruel scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage - he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions, in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career.the potency of that voice is demonstrated in the ambrose chapel sequence, when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. at the albert hall, it is her need to cry out, to exercise those impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the embassy finale, it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. by contrast, all of stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall, and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed, thus depriving the police of potentially useful information. it is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice, in the rescue of hank from the embassy, that he actually succeeds in doing something useful.far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing, 'que sera sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the mckennas; 'the future's not ours to see' indeed. it also neatly prepares the way for the finale, in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day.the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature - the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall. this lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. we see people conduct conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. we don't need to - the images say everything. it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds. the editing is incredibly tight, matched to the music perfectly. there isn't a frame out of place - anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is playing out. it builds slowly, but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable. when jo screams, it isn't just a relief for her, but for the audience.the ambrose chapel sequence is witty, and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick-in-the-mud nonconformist church. the embassy sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that preceded it on first viewing, but second time around actually seems more effective, with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background, reminiscent of the music-as-ambient-noise in 'rear window'. the score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music from on-screen sources to be foregrounded effectively.bernard miles is a low-key villain, a little banal, but with a dry wit. he's outshone by brenda de banzie as his wife, who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin - her stance is pure gangster's moll, belying the middle-england exterior, but she clearly has a soft side, and possibly maternal feelings towards hank.stewart is excellent, although if hitchcock really did always cast him as 'everyman', as the director's daughter seems to think, then it confirms that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive necrophiliac in vertigo. day is nothing short of phenomenal. just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdoes anything, but neither does she sell it short. this is one of hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the mckennas; they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.

many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much, which i have not had the opportunity to view. by itself, the '56 version is a very well done film. the run of mid-to-late fifties hitchcock films (including "rear window", "dial m for murder", "vertigo", and "to catch a thief", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career. in the man who knew too much, jimmy stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always. doris day is very believable in the role of an atypical hitchcock blond. i thought there was nothing fake about her performance. her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "yes, dear", pretty thing on jimmy stewart's arm.there were some really clever lines written for hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- it's too bad christopher olsen read them so woodenly. it's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though. most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, though- most notably the assassin (played by reggie nalder). some little touches that make this film undeniably hitchcockian- the use of non-english dialog, especially french (something hitch did on a much larger scale in "to catch a thief"); the use of foreboding, arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; stewart and day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the albert hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect hitch used at the end of "spellbound", also).all in all, the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch. it's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ("vertigo", "strangers on a train"), but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces.

alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 british film, "the man who knew too much". this 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. mr. hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next, thus keeping a standard in his work. robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini's editing shows his talent. ultimately, bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture.james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr. hitchcock. in this version, he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son. when we meet him, they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins. his wife is the lovely doris day at her best. she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. the film has some good supporting cast, brenda debanzie, bernard miles, daniel gelin, alan mowbray, among others, do a great job in portraying their characters.although this is a "light hitchcock", one can't dismiss it as a failure. "the man who knew too much" is a change of pace for hitchcock's fans.

many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message, thus confusing the hero, not to mention the audience...dr. ben mckenna (james stewart) and his wife jo, a former musical star (doris day) are vacationing in morocco with their son, hank (christopher olsen), when they meet mr. and mrs. drayton, a british couple (brenda de banzie and bernard miles). they are also befriended by a charming frenchman, louis bernard (daniel gelin), who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute...the mackennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the draytons, when they spot louis bernard... the next day in the market place, they are caught in an assassination intrigue... while they are wandering in the local market, the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers... dr. mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms, a knife sticking out of his back... gulping his last breath, the dying man mutters some words and collapses... dr. mckenna is completely taken aback when the arab's hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise... mckenna is left knowing too little, but as far as the assassins are concerned, too much...to prevent dr. mckenna from revealing what he knows, the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage... the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnapping¬óhow to get the little boy back safely... the subplot about the assassination is just the setup...the film is a breathless escapade... the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it... stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor, accidentally involved in political intrigue... his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly human¬óa person we could easily identify with... it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film... by 1956, the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer... she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth etting's biopic, 'love me or leave me,' but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents...the casting of character actor reggie malder as the assassin, is brilliant... the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil...

fun story of a regular guy with big dreams, this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success. great performances by lou myers and brian's neighbor, alex. i giggled alot and even cried a little.

i thought this was a really cute movie - inspiring (makes me want to try acting)- i love kelly ripa and it's nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children - i've already watched it 3 times! of course i also loved seeing joe barbara - especially since another world went off the air!

this movie was so heart warming. a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs.it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen. this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams!never give up!hurray for the stand -in!!!

a superman cartoona huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train. using ultra-modern techniques, a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold. with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board, it's superman to the rescue. but now that it's become a runaway train, can even he stop the billion dollar limited?this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio. they feature great animation and taut, fast-moving plots. meant to be shown in movie theaters, they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts.

millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury. traveling along is lois lane to report on it. along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves. they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones. this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves. the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in. she beats the thieves off the train (at one point using a gun) but the train starts to careen out of control. lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. good thing superman is on the way!fast, exciting, non-stop action. probably one of the best of all the cartoons. just great.

looks as if the robocop writer has been wholesale looting the vindicator. this is a very solid horror/action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment. anyone who have seen robocop knows the story. watch out for pam grier as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin. this highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyones liking, but this canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre. 8/10

as a fan of robocop, i always loved this movie. i seen it when it first came out, and finally i bought it on dvd from brazil, it was never released in the us on dvd. i like the film, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their opinion, love it or hate it. no matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why didn't they do it another way?" in other words you cant please everyone. if you love robocop, you will love this film. to me, its so unique thats its not cheesy, or silly like a lot of lower budget movies. this film always kept me interested. i can see a few scenes that robocop borrowed from here, but tell me what movies don't do that? a lot of films use other ideas from other movies, and sometimes change them around. fun film!

scientist carl lehman (well played by david mcilwraith) gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. he has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist alex whyte (a perfectly hateful portrayal by richard cox). lehman embarks on an all-out killing spree. it's up to nasty mercenary hunter (a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine pam grier) to put a stop to him. director jean-claude lord, who previously helmed the under-appreciated slasher psycho thriller "visiting hours," stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout, thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy sci-fi/horror action outing. paunchy character thesp maury chaykin easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with lehman's pregnant wife lauren (a winning performance by the lovely teri austin). stan winston's nifty make-up f/x and paul zaza's thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun.

one of the best western movies ever made. unfortunately, it never got the recognition it deserved. the storyline, the action and the music was in my mind, one of the best. i give it a double a+. randolph scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast. the ending was one of the best of any western made.

if western union isn't exactly the real story of the construction of the transcontinental telegraph, it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project.dean jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he's thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs. an outlaw on the run, randolph scott, finds jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings jagger to help. later on he's hired by western union and works for jagger.jagger also hires a young easterner played by robert young who's an engineer. young is doing one of his few loan out films away from mgm for 20th century fox. both young and scott become friends, but rivals for jagger's sister virginia gilmore.western union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy any western fans. the telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws, indians, and your garden variety labor troubles.slim summerville as the timid cook and victor killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes. they both provide some good comic relief. fritz lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along. western union is solid western entertainment.

i first saw this film in the theater way back in the 40s when i was a kid and always remembered the ending. there is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed. something just resonates with them. this is one of those films and i agree with another reviewer who said fritz lang should have directed more westerns. to add to it i have always liked randolph scott and robert young. in fact, robert young stars in what i consider my favorite movie if i have to name just one, not an easy thing to do. that film is northwest passage. it led me to the superb historical novels of kenneth roberts. western union likewise led me to reading zane grey's novel which, in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where i like the movie better than the novel. not that grey's novel is a bad one; i just like the movie story better. the movie in no way resembles the novel. it is a completely different tale, one of the biggest departures from a book i have seen.i can't add much to the other reviews except to say i agree with many of them. i, too, wish it would be released on dvd. "whatever happened to randolph scott happened to the best of me."

fritz lang directed two great westerns: "western union" and "the return of frank james". the frank james movie equals "jesse james". "western union" is one of randolph scott's great westerns. i have never seen robert young in a western before; he is terrific as the telegraph employee. this is the only movie i can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west. it is a high-geared story about the telegraph in the west, a triangle love story, and about loyalty. the supporting cast is superb. dean jagger, who made a few westerns, plays the telegraph manager. virginia gilmore, who plays mr. jagger's sister, is the love interest in the movie. ms. gilmore had a short career in movies. she quit films in 1952 and became a drama coach. she is primarily known as the first mrs. yul brynner. it is great to see slim summerville in a movie with mr. scott again. they were in two other great movies: "rebecca of sunnybrook farm" and "jesse james".

hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries. this movie has a cast that includes robert young, randolph scott, dean jagger and john carradine. scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger's life. jagger works for western union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west. jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits. scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride. scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can't tell anyone. it's a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns.

while escaping from a heist of a bank, the outlaw vance shaw (randolph scott) helps edward creighton (dean jagger), the chief-engineer of the western union that is surveying the wild west and had had an accident with a horse. in 1861, vance regenerates and is hired to work for the western union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from omaha to salt lake city. vance and the engineer from harvard richard blake (robert young) flirt with the gorgeous edward's sister sue creighton (virginia gilmore) and she chooses vance. however, his past haunts him when the outlaw jack slade (barton maclane) steals the western union cattle disguised of indians."western union" is a good but predictable western directed by fritz lang. the story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the west, facing thieves and indians. the entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of the identity of jack slade, there is no surprise in the story. randolph scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "os conquistadores" ("the conquerors")

i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience. instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west, it was the story of board rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and disliked) of the great "robber barons": jay gould. gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival vanderbilt's. but this, while interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves. at least, that is how audiences would see it. jay gould died in 1892. had he lived into the modern era, and invested in hollywood, he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.the film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by indians, spurred on by one jack slade (barton maclane). slade, a desperado, is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories. he is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires, edward creighton (dean jagger), creighton's associate richard blake (robert young), and a quasi-lawman vance shaw (randolph scott), who is slade's brother. blake, an easterner with little understanding of the west, is romancing creighton's sister sue (virginia gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. but he does become a close friend of shaw, especially in trying to confront slade.slade was a real western criminal, by the way, and the subject of a section of mark twain's roughing it. he was hanged in the 1870s. but he did not have any involvement in stirring up indians against railroads or telegraph companies. however, maclane makes him a memorably evil, and totally vicious type. his killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance. but lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches. look at the sequence with chill wills, where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. he spits tobacco juice several times while talking to young, who gets a little splattered. then there is an indian attack which we watch from the ground level. at the conclusion, young suddenly gets splattered again, but it's not brown but red that covers him. he looks up at the pole's top, and there is wills with an indian arrow through him.it is an exciting film to watch, and well worth catching.

"western union" is something of a forgotten classic western! perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on dvd in the united states. however, all is not lost as it has now appeared on region 2 in england. this - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union telegraph company is without a region 1 release. it beggars belief! it simply doesn't make sense!produced by fox in 1941 "western union" was directed by fritz lang. this was only the second occasion the great german director undertook to direct a western! he had done an excellent job the year before with fox's "the return of frank james" and would have only one more western outing in 1952 with the splendid "rancho notorious". lang was no ford or hawks but with "western union" he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by robert young, randolph scott and dean jagger. the female lead is taken by virginia gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. an actress who never made anything of her career. her presence here is merely cosmetic.it is curious that robert young has top billing over scott! it is clearly scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. young doesn't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. he just looks plain silly going up against barton mclane in a gunfight! an actor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with "crossfire" (1947)- young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tv's "marcus welby md" in the seventies. he died in 1998 at the age of 91."western union" recounts the connection by telegraph wire of omaha and salt lake city. scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from marauding sioux and to also take on mclane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with scott for the affections of miss gilmore. some comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly so some would say - by slim summerville and john carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor.altogether though a spanking good western, albeit on region 2, but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. my only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. ugh!footnote: interestingly the associate producer on "western union" was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a partnership that would produce some of scott's finest westerns in the fifties.

i saw this years ago, and it's entertaining, but not profound. the basic story is of a young man who dreams of midian, though he's not sure where it is or even if it really exists.spoilers follow: he finally visits it, gets transformed to a nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one. then, he has to help the other members of the nightbreed because they're being attacked by canadians. (save for the accents, they all act like good ol' boys. not much in tune with the canadian psyche, eh?) someone observed for "monsters" or "nightbreed," substitute "jews," and for the canadians/humans, substitute, "nazis," and you're supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans. well, maybe.one major objection i had was that while the underground city was interesting, it was rather ramshackle and, frankly, dirty. this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements. one would think that if the monsters were the good guys, some would have at least a little sense of decor.the storyline is a tad thin, but that's to introduce characters. but it's entertaining enough for a repeat view.

featuring some amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, superbly designed and executed sets, nightbreed is a great film.sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity.perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries.none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie/superhero genre.a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting. another idea would be the foundation of the new midian. perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus.

nightbreed blew my mind the first time i saw it. and it's held up quite well over the years. the sets and monster effects work, are some of the best i've ever seen. nobody i know seems to have seen this film, which i believe tanked at the box office, because of the lack of interest in horror, in the early nineties. it plays like a dark, horrific fairy tale, and is a lot deeper, then you'd think, with a strong message against bigotry, presented by a rich mystical past, that clive barker created. what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note, that we'll probably never see. my only minor gripe is that craig sheffer is only a passable actor at best, and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part. just a minor complaint though as sheffer does alright. i had a similar issue with scott bakula in barker's lord of illusions, not really a terrible performance, but i just didn't like him in the role as much as i would have other people.

delivers great acting and greater special effects. stars david cronenberg, one of my personal favorites, as decker. it's special effects on the monsters were so good, you thought they might be really deformed. clive barker, however demented, scored a perfect 10 on my list.

let me say from the outset i'm not a particular fan of this kind of film, but nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective.back in the old days, the folks who inhabit midian would have been called zombies, the undead. and according to what clive barker has given us certain members of human kind, in this craig sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world.psychiatrist david cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the nightbreed. he tricks the police into killing sheffer, but sheffer goes to a graveyard named midian cemetery where the nightbreed congregate and live underground. sheffer has also left a girl friend, anne bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he's been killed and is now one of the undead. she tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. clive barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans. but it's plain to see that if humans left them alone, the nightbreed in turn not bother with them.your sympathies are definitely with the nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like cronenberg and redneck police chief charles haid in action.clive barker's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. i can see where that would come in, especially since there are a whole lot of people who don't even think of gays as anything human because they're taught that way.granted nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also does make you think and i do like the way clive barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes craig sheffer a kind of messiah for the nightbreed creatures.

this film got roasted by the boys at mst3k, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film noir. the plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the pacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors. true, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but he's actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind. the scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful, in a minimalist kind of way. sure it's depressing, but that's the point. good movie.

for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was, it was a children's reality show about real kids living at summer camp. bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. it was full of romance, friendships, fights, overcoming your fears, and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months. it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. regularly, but is amazing non-the-less. the show was never dull and always attracted my attention. it's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before going. plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that's at a camp for like only a week. the length of the camps where perfect for this show, and the environment they where in was fantastic. they where camps all over the u.s., that each provided unique activities for the campers. it was a truly amazing, unscripted show.

bug juice changed my life. i know it sounds strange, odd , weird. but it did. i am from england, bug juice never aired there but five years ago i went on vacation with my family and saw it on the disney channel. once i saw this tv series i was hooked i wanted to go.it took a lot of convincing to my parents to allow my brother and i to go to waziyatah. i have been going since i was 12 and it was my forth year this summer. if you are a teenager reading this come to this camp it changes your life. you make life long friends at wazi. it doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like you everyone likes you at camp. you have so much fun. if you want to have a look go on to www.wazi.com and check it out for yourself. it is so much fun i love it there it is my home away from home

i absolutely loved this show. never understood why it was called bug juice though. i must have been about 13 when it came out. i remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel 4, between re-runs of pugwalls summer and saved by the bell or something like that. i remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too - ha ha. all the kids in it looked to be having so much fun, it was all about "discovering who you are" and "growing up." first kisses and all that stuff. i remember there was this really cute guy in it, i think he was the main reason i got up in the mornings that particular summer. they should have more teen docu-soaps like this, i thought it was great!

this movie should have easily qualified as a filmthat best promotes human understanding among people.it may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped german prisoner of war.kristy mcnichol depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy, young girl thirsting for acceptance and love. michael constantine gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and esther rolle, as the maid, ruth, gave a superb emmy-winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events.bruce davison portrays the german who is supposedly not guilty of nazi atrocities. this is how his role appears. he has escaped, but he joined the german army and he might have been a member of the hitler youth movement.the action takes place in 1944 georgia, in a rural area. the townspeople are filled with prejudice. even the fbi inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the jews. notice the opposite interpretation that as mcnichol is in bed, davison is hunted down and ultimately shot. it is interesting to see that society views mcnichol as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war. the film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. constantine's outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting. as the mother, barbara barrie, is given little to do. it was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips.memorably done and well worth viewing.

i loved this moviee well i loved the romance part with colby and the girl...rachel (?) 4got her name....i honestly was only interested in those too. i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that. but please no more sad endings where they cant be 2gether! =( it made me cry! but the romance between them. the plot the trauma everything was great. =) i just was more into colby and rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat. because i sure was. honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple (colby and rachel) and at least a decent ending. i hated the ending, a better one could have been more thought out, not the fact of forcing colby to his death and rachel having a son. the ending would have killed the movie.

this has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it's exposure of the injustices of bigotry. billy wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as corby/white wolf. however, felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes. this is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring.

i am a big fan of this film and found the tv mini series "children of the dust", the version fans should look for. at least 20 minutes or more are cut on the dvd version of this film.i would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with corby/whitewolf and rachel, more on black history and buffalo solders. there were two many storylines for the series or this film.sidney poitier only shows he gets better with age, the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of gypsy smith and regina taylor were wonderful viewing. i also enjoyed the billy wirth/joanna going storyline, they seems to play off each other well.billy wirth is of course the "model of indian vision". the look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero. worked for me also.much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the 1880's, white take over of native schooling, lack of black pioneers to setup towns in the west. michael moriarty (maxwell) as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher, not sure if the "whites" should be interfering with native culture.for anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you. i thought the chemistry between poitier's character and that of the orphan whitewolf very moving and thought wirth and poitier worked very well together. billy wirth did some of his best scenes when working with poitier.going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a " wake-up and grown-up" call. but on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment.look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference.

i don't understand why more people have not commented on this, other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it. it's an amazing cast of characters, one after another after another, all done by the guy who wrote the play. if you don't like filmed plays, you may not like this (after all, plays usually don't look good on tv), but it's a one-man show that will have you paying attention throughout. highly recommended.

a very well directed version of eric bogosian's stage play. well worth checking out for bogosian's great characters and for anyone who wants to see how to bring a play to the movies correctly.

eric bogosian's ability to roll from character to character in this 'one man show' exhibits his true range as a character actor. each persona has their own message to convey about truth, society, class, drugs, etc. this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting! his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience.

this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched. at the age of 12 i was up late and ran across the movie. it was on the usa channel, gilbert godfrey's up all night. i will never forget. at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. you know 12 is a very rough and weird age. it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me. i now have a daughter that is 12. have been searching for a couple years for this movie. if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy. would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age.

many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining and memorable. the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. this film follows three friends (gary, rick and david "the big apple") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. we follow hopeless romantic gary (the main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending. if you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. l.a.v. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it's genre.

the last american virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies that i really enjoyed. the subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that hollywood was (and still is) cranking out these days. but for awhile, the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn't toned downed or soften for the kiddies. the men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from cannon.three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school. they'll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal. the sensitive one of the group (andrew monsoon) what's to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get. one day, the kid finds his perfect girl (diane franklin). but fate would play one of their foul tricks. his best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet. after knocking her up, the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion. he still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers. still, he tries his best to get her to love him. the night comes when he pops the question to her. but his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend. in tears, the kid leaves the party.what i enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches. instead of being filled with phony situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. the movie's filled with it's share of funny moments and hysteria. i have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies.highly recommended.

i see there are great reviews of this film already, i've got a few points to comment on, reasons i thought there was something special about this film...first and foremost, the film is realistic. it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager, but that's really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time. second, the good guy, the guy who treats women with respect, doesn't get the girls. that's the way it is, in real life just the same! he's too nice for his own good. people are just selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self-confidence. i mean, that role already takes confidence from the actor, i'm not just talking about the character. overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky, partyin' teen sex comedies at the rental shelf. don't get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's a good laugh as well.

i first saw this movie when i was about 12 years old. it has been one of my favorites since... it's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack, cheesy dialog, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end... i won't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker... i just remember feeling so sad for gary! what a bunch of cool characters in this movie it's genius!!! they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesn't like...(she had a nice little body though). i can't believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck!!! ha ha ha... when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases(almost). but a love story at heart with real problems, dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast. i love this movie !!! if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too!

i saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago. if you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves. it is a little like american pie meets fast times at ridgemont high but with more depth. it handles the same issues as both movies, but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth. the ending is sad, but that is how life is. i think everyone should see it. i have it on dvd form, and it took such a long time to find it too. that should say something, heh and another thing i will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack. i believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing. it has songs by artists like the commodores, u2, devo, reo speedwagon, the cars, kc and the sunshine band, and many more.

i totally loved this movie, tried to buy it and can't find it. a must see, a movie you can watch again and again, funny but also a tear jerker in one. really good album for the movie. it's a really good 80's movie, i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie, cause i would,the actors in it acted really good.there's a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie.that's what makes this movie so good. so go out and try to rent this one, you won't regret it. it's an older movie but it's worth watching, i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon, but i'm sure it would not be the same. anyone who hasn't seen it, go rent it.

i don't think i will include any spoilers but if i do, i can cover my butt. "the last american virgin" came in a time were such teenage coming of age/high school sex romps were the rave. films such as "prepies" (1984), "hot times" (1974) and the popular "porky's " (1981) were making mucho money. yet it is the "last american virgin" the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations. it is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity. the go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (older woman with jealous boyfriend) and the convenient ones (luring their high school female counterparts). the movie has a lot of funny moments, and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star, it is worth remembering for a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes: devo, the cars, journey and others. by today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a nc-17 rating, but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain,while love might be right in front of us. it is a little piece of 80s americana and worth having in your movie collection.

reality before reality tv? copy of "fast times at ridgemont high"? a precursor to "say anything" that's grittier? i can't decide, but the soundtrack *is* the 80's--blondie, journey, reo speedwagon, devo, lionel richie, and u2--i can't believe this, they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today.i remembered this like a teenager--mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism. why? i was a horny teenager in the 80's. watching it again, i just can't describe how much i love that rose, play by kimberly richardson, turns out to be the voice of "pepper ann" in the 90's, and she was almost 30 when she was in last american virgin, playing alongside 16 year-olds--fantastic! complete cheese, reality, fantasy, and comedy--with a sincere cherry on top.

i really like this movie. i like it not just because it's a great early 80s movie with a great soundtrack but i found that it has some thought-provoking moments. they are just moments; not the entire film. it's definitely not like "less than zero".the scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems, like the betrayal of trust. these problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters. certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one's own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected one's character and outlook as an adult.you can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face, and about your own experiences. or you can just pay attention to the boys' quest to de-virginize themselves! :) either way it's a good movie.

when i watched this movie in my adolescence, i attempted for the soundtrack. some bands of the soundtrack i still didn't know. however, during the film, i already noticed her quality. u2, blondie, police. , quincy jones , commodores .sensational soundtrack.in brazil, there is a long time this film didn't pass in tv. today, he passed in cable tv and i remembered to access the site to do the comment.the end of the film surprised me a lot, but it is what happens in the real life. not always, what thought about being the ideal, it is what happens. the life brings us a lot of surprises.

this movie was release when i was 15 and i could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed.that was over 24 years ago and i haven't seen the movie since. this time around i cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is.life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact i think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. also it doesn't matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you. girls/boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. sometimes you just gotta let go and say next.gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for karen. this is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone.i remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. the acting is not quite there compared with fast times at ridgemount high but it kicks ass over this movie simply because ftarh has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. nice guys finish last!! gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive. we all know a david, fun guy who makes you laugh.some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them, especially at that age. i have experienced that first hand.great sound track too!! u2 "i will follow" - jesus is it that old??

as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time,and one of my personal favorites. to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time. it's underrated,and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people. it comes on tbs maybe once a year,but sometimes longer. the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest,and most of the time serious. with only a few comic scenes. in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time. i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before. there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin. hes in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures. that are very funny. gary is major in love with the new girl in school. he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her. he also cheats on the side. you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much. you can feel it even more in the second half. gary's friend turns out to be a creep. but his other friend is pretty cool. the movie shows how mean people can be. you can relate to a lot of this movie. the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy. but it's so much more than that. it's a very honest movie. it's also very 80ish which i love. if you love the 80's or grew-up in the 80's,rent this movie. but there may be some people that don't like the 80's,but still may like this movie. i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think. it's very entertaining,and very funny. it combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it's an underrated gem! i have the movie. i love it! i give the last american virgin ***1/2 out of ****

it plays like your usual teenage-audience t&a movie, but the sentiment is incredibly bleak. if it was made today, it'd be considered an art house movie. it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying.the whole teen flick formula is adhered to, but nothing turns out the way you'd expect. imagine a director's cut of 'it's a wonderful life' where, at the end, james stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world. an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre. it makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. i'm amazed it ever got made. the eighties version of detective story.

"the last american virgin", along with "fast times at ridgemont high" is one the last great teen films ever made. it is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties. much-maligned by critics that it was a sophomoric, banal attempt to recreate the magic of "fast times at ridgemont high", these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed concurrently during late 1981, and released at only slight intervals from one another. either way, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity. especially considering the heart-wrenching discovery the protagonist, gary is confronted with in the end. american pie this is not. the story revolves around a trio of male teenagers, and their mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits. gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline last american virgin. secretly, gary lusts after karen, who is involved with rick, his best friend. rick and karen begin having sex, and karen gets pregnant, only to be dumped by rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him. gary glides into help karen, which leads to the aforementioned, unexpected conclusion. overall as a film, i find it was very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are just as pertinent today as they were over twenty years ago. also, it has one of the rockingest soundtracks ever made!!!

spoilers: this movie has it's problems, but in the end it gets the message across. i liked it because it ends the way things really do. the nice guy tries and tries, gets his heart broken several times, but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending. it ends the way such things always end, or at least always have in my own and friends' experiences. anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn't how it really happens, as the first comment seemed to, believing that the girl would come around, realize she's dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesn't care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i. i give it 7/10, extra points simply because it wasn't afraid to end on a down note, give no real resolution, just the main character left heartbroken, confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before.

ahhh...the '80's. 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in america. fresh off the "do what feels good" '70's, "the last american virgin" comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as yet another 'teenage sex comedy' from the glory days. oh sure, there's sex, but, i can't think of another movie--ok, this and "fast times at ridgemont high"--that really wasn't killing time between topless teenage scenes--there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage.the movie follows three hormonal friends. gary (wanting to lose his virginity), rick (stud incarnate), and david (overweight, but, not inexperienced) as they try desperately hard to make sure gary joins the world of manhood. but, a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger--gary falls for karen (pretty brunette who loves the bad boys), and can't seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that david and rick can facilitate. only trouble is, rick and karen get hot and heavy and karen skips a period. it's gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion, and it's gary who truly cares. but, who is karen dancing with by film end...rick. subtract the "r" and add a "d" where necessary.what separates this film from others from the '80's we think about is that, by god, they attempt some real drama here, and not of the "my parents just pulled in the driveway variety." and, you know what? i bought it.it wasn't sloppy. it wasn't far-fetched. and, when gary sees rick dancing with karen at the house party at the end of the film, i actually felt sorry for the guy. our teenage romeo actually believed in unrequited love--and when his heart was broken at the end, it all sort of touched me.so, all the t&a aside, there's an actually pretty believable and engaging story here. oscar worthy? not by a mile, but, i don't know that i'd lump it into the "let's get laid" category, either. like "fast times at ridgemont high," they actually were trying to do a true film here, letting the hi-jinx in between fall where it may.

what looks like a ho-hum porky's rip-off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love.the story concerns three friends, gary, ricky and david, who spend their after school hours looking for sex. when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her.the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities. it is funny and sad at the same time. it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made. you know the guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy gets girl back in the final frame formula. that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl. maybe that is why i liked the film so much.the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker. it also might be one of the most realistic endings i've ever seen in a love story.

i have always liked this film and i'm glad it's available finally on dvd so more viewers can see what i have been telling them all these years. story is about a high school virgin named gary (lawrence monoson) who works at a pizza place as a delivery boy and he hangs out with his friends david (joe rubbo) and rick (steve antin). gary notices karen (diane franklin) who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love. that night at a party he see's rick with karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but doesn't tell anyone of his true feelings.*****spoiler alert*****rick asks gary if he can borrow his grandmothers vacant home but gary makes up an excuse so that rick can't get karen alone. but one night rick brags to gary that he nailed her at the football field and gary becomes enraged. a few days later in the school library gary see's rick and karen arguing and he asks karen what is wrong. she tells him that she's pregnant and that rick has dumped her. gary helps her by taking her to his grandmothers home and paying for her abortion. finally, gary tells karen how he really feels about her and she seems receptive to his feelings but later at her birthday party he walks in on karen and rick together again. gary drives off without the girl! this film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is. no matter how nice you are you don't necessarily get the girl.this film was directed by boaz davidson who would go on to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things right with this movie. first, he made sure that there was plenty of gratuitous nudity so that this was marketable to the young males that usually go to these films. secondly, he had the film end with young gary without karen and i think the males in the audience can relate to being screwed over no matter how hard you try and win a girls heart. yes, this film is silly and exploitive but it is funny and sexy. actress louisa moritz almost steals the film as the sexy carmela. moritz was always a popular "b" level actress and you might remember her in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". like "fast times at ridgemont high" this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is going on in the story. but at the heart of this film is two very good performances by monoson and franklin. there is nudity required by franklin but she still conveys the sorrow of a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time. she's always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film. but this is still monoson's story and you can't help but feel for this guy. when the film ends it's his performance that stays with you. it's a solid job of acting that makes this more than just a teen sex comedy. even with the silly scenarios of teens trying to have sex this film still manages to achieve what it wants. underrated comedy hits the bullseye.

yes it's a fast times wannabe, but it's still decent entertainment.some of the comedy parts are really funny. the scene when the three guys visit the spanish lady is hilarious, with a little flamenco music in the background. the reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot. the guys' exploits in dealing with crabs are funny as well when they try to "drown them" and when they visit the pharmacist. the abortion scene is a fast times ripoff too, but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation. you really feel for what karen is going through, and for gary in his mad scramble for cash to pay for the abortion and accommodating her recovery.the ending is painful to watch, but refreshingly realistic. first-time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock.there is a decent eye-candy for guys with young girls and the milf spanish lady, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis-measuring competition. underrated soundtrack too. check out early, early u2(!), the cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by james ingram for the surprise ending.some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated, but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early 80s should like it.

this is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made.i saw this growing up and it was, and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "fast times" but just as great.there is a serious side to this movie, as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and morphs into a drama about halfway through. that's the beauty of it though and what sets it apart. you get it all. humor(not unlike that of "fast times" ), drama, and a great great soundtrack.i personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this, it would give an idea about the journey their about to embark on. cmon-what kid watching this, wouldn't be able to relate to someone in the movie? the fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well done.you don't even see it coming. definitely a lot of surprises.spoilers:don't read anymore if you don't want to know.great, knee slappping humor.(who could forget the scene between gary and camilla?). i can still hear it:"oh my big strong burrito!!" priceless!!some of the scenes between gary and karin are hard to watch(particularly the final scene of coarse). there are so so many women like karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did. think about it-how many women reject men with hearts of gold(like gary) for jerks? i know i've done it-and so have many females i know. this movie will inspire discussion and, despite the countless times i've seen it, still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers. everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what's more likely more then one person.lastly, the music used is just great(a lot of cars, u2,lots of obscure(now) songs from the 80's.-an 80's purist's dream.)but make no mistake, it is not the music that makes this movie unique, it is the story itself, plain and simple. one of the best of it's kind and a teen movie classic.

spoilers in this review! despite a few highly improbable scenes, including the boys in pe measuring their penises in a contest and the few obligatory teens-trying-to-get-laid vignettes, this movie captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen films have ever done. it achieves this by not only showing the trio of friends, gary, dave, rick, as smoking, drinking, ever on the prowl teens, but also dwells on the nature of friendship itself as these three friends have their loyalties tested. this film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. for the shy romantic gary, when he sees the lovely karen for the first time he falls instantly in love. the awakening emotion in gary is writ large on the screen, and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is jilted by her lover. this love for karen signals the end of gary's innocence, as the bonds with his two best friends will be tested, and broken, over the course of the story. the confident ladies man, rick, is the person in high school we all secretly wish we were: handsome, cool, and always has the impossibly beautiful girls in a swoon. rick turns out to be a cad, but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old. he panics and makes a bad decision. from rick's perspective, the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams, a bad breakup, and then at the end reconciling. the look on rick's face as gary walks in and sees karen kissing rick, shows that he at last understands that his best friend and he love the same woman. as in real life, you don't bow out because your friend has an unrequited love. this is the tragedy of the film. rick is no villain, and constantly through the film he reminds gary and dave that they're his best friends. the soulful quality of gary's performance, however, is the heart of the story. lawrence monoson is a beautiful loser. he does everything right, his heart's in the right place, and he's consumed by love for karen. yet, karen, in the end, is not moved by gary's devotion and kindness. karen represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back, who exist in a vacuum of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others. this film is brutal in its statements on love and friendship, but that's what makes it unique among teen films. it ceases being a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film, albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusion. anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not win her, will understand. the heartrending crushes of high school are every bit as real as the emotional strains of adulthood, and this film will remind you of that in bold strokes. gary's final reversal, as he drives away with the inscribed locket, is as poignant a moment as any in cinema. one feels, after watching this, that it's really made of two movies. the first part is a silly teen sexploitation film, and once the story begins, it's a strongly affecting drama. a terrific movie. it should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars including the police, the cars, devo, oingo boingo, the plimsouls, the waitresses, gleaming spires, and phil seymour.

when i was in 10th grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie. we watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had boobs. but then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless. i think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of whimpered "oh dude....." it goes from dumb 80's teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you off guard. i have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it - and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend - so it seems. but now it is available! i highly suggest renting it and brace yourself.

perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny. maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it. but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in. and that is, " nice guys finish last ".there is a line in angel heart from lisa bonet's character that says " it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster. " true. most likely. women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever. but ( at least at an early age ) they end up going for the good looking, slimy, disrespectful, untamed guy. the one they know they can't conform to their beliefs. and that is part of the attraction. after all, what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be? i believe this may have happened to boaz davidson. and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to, is that you will get your heart broken. it happens to everyone and it will happen to you. and that is a strong final statement in the film. but having said all that, the movie is fun. it is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well.this is a rare film that is sleezy enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it;s like to get your heart broken. no highschool film has ever done this better. like i said, i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand. maybe we all have.this is an old film, but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night, pick it up, you may be surprised. it is a hell of a lot better than never been kissed.

this is one of those movies which get better with each viewing. i watched it three times and actually registered on imdb because i wanted to comment on it. movies "about food" have been done before, some of them are really good - as, for instance, a certain japanese comedy which aficionados of asian cinema will know anyway. but this one really is in its own league. at its core is a protestant christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness but, far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the "good" in each and every of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. there is a pervading understatement and refinement in babette's feast but this makes the message of the movie, if anything, stronger, not at all weaker. if you cannot attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by babette, you're still welcome to this feast of the soul. highly recommended!!

it has started quietly. if your are looking for an action-packed movie this is absolutely not the right choice. all characters are slowly depicted on the scene. stroke after stroke on the scene canvas. none can take away his hands to the priest and so the sisters lifespan devotion can only remain into the village. philippa and martina know their destiny, belong only to the village. so when you understand that, you are on the movie scene, in the village that becomes the whole known world in that time. when, no technology can let you imagine anything else than the campaign, the village, the sea. you feel the rhythm of that ancient village's life. watching the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can cause you to approach this evening dinner with some sumptuous expectations ...the final sentence that give a title to babette's sacrifice far from paris: an artist is never poor.superb photography. many situations depict portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas there, in jutland, in 18th century.

i don't see why everyone is bombing this so much. i thought it was a great fun time that sadly wasn't popular enough to be that famous. believe me i have seen much much worse than this. if you want a bad movie see blood shack or the alien dead or something. so what this is normal slasher fare but better than most. and it is watchable. this movie also has one of the best soundtracks i've heard. some of the music is very suspenseful. and the death scenes are cool too. we see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words sold written in blood on the mirror, and we also get a cool double beating by a toilet plunger! with razors attached to it! this was a good fun 80s slasher that's definitely worth your time despite what others say about it.

now, i've seen many many b-grade films in my 15 years of living, and i must say that this was one of the better ones. i personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline, but it did suffer from amateur acting (although adrienne barbeau did give a decent performance as lisa grant). joseph bottoms couldn't hold his part well enough to be considered good. the other performance which really fit the film was that of barry hope (barney resnick). it begins with an eager real estate agent taking an asian couple through a house, only to find there's a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. it progresses with detective speculating, and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace. i think that for any person who's in for a giggle at the over-the-top drama the victim realtors provide during the over-the-top gory scenes, this truly is a gem... xd who am i kidding? it's not that great, but worth a watch if you're insanely bored.

this is a wonderful movie. i've only seen it twice, and i've been looking for it again for ever. i'd buy it if i could find it. while it's sad, it shows three things -- how much a man can love a woman, how hard some people want something and how hard people work to overcome their limitations.

this one gets better with each new look. certainly one of paul sorvino's best roles. outstanding music score which was also outstanding on sound track lp (so why no cd?). one the very early dolby stereo sound film releases. by the way, the original 35mm theatrical trailer for this is really great!

when you read about this film you wanna cringe. i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself! so what is the attraction here? i think that for me, it's the offbeatness of the romance. i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmy-breslin-like columnist and a down-on-her-luck (health-wise) ballerina. you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman. like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint. he's a bit overweight (at least as a would-be suitor for a ballerina. hope that doesn't sound unkind) and possibly a tad too old for her. nice change of pace from greek god wooing super-model. the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later, which is a pretty good sign. however some of the acting is just dreadful. a subplot involving a young puerto-rican boy befriended by sorvino's character is just hilariously bad. but the opening scene where ditchburn is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story. good luck finding it. you'd think that lifetime would be re-airing this or even we, but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years.

i was never all that impressed by night gallery, but this one episode stands out.a tv network executive auditions an odd act - a young, nerdy boy who proceeds to make prognostications. the exec dismisses the whole thing as a flaky waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning.what first seemed a parlor act becomes a hit show as the kid's predictions prove consistently accurate.then, one day, he refuses to do the show. facing imminent showtime, everyone's at wit's end, even threatening him with legal action if he doesn't fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions.the young boy relents, and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow.after the show, the befuddled executive asks for an explanation, only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal.

i adore the ln chaney version of "phantom" and i appreciate webber's version if only for the growing interest in the book, wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed. i don't approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrained.luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesn't even have to bother with any other characters.i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up lon's performance. i was dead wrong. leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though, of course this is a spoof. it's still brilliant.i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim. i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that, other than lon's.however, i do not recommend this short if you don't like spoofs. because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously.

bridget fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention in break up. it's true the story is missing critical details in several places, but i just kept scrutinizing fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn't let me down. the look in her eyes in the last scene, as she musters up courage to, literally, put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever. i believed her completely, possibly because i've known and admired several "tough broads" who survived similar abusive situations. and they did this without becoming man-haters, but that's my own hopeful projection of fonda's character at the break up.

excellent drama. very dark. i have never seen california photographed in such a way. bridget fonda as the deaf wife beaten by her husband is superb. the film gripped me from start to finish. very understated performance by sutherland. the direction was very european. amazing to get such a performance from fonda.

nothing great here but a nicely acted story about an abused deaf wife (fonda) of a small time crook (bochner)who gets involved with one of her husband's plans and his mistress. sutherland and weber are cops drawn into what turns out to be a unmysterious murder investigation and the story just flows along.

i've tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. finally, read something today, 03/09/2005, that mentioned stacy keach's name, and it reminded me that i had seen a movie that he was in in 1974 at the atlanta film festival, so, i did a google search for keach's movies and found the gravy train. we were supposed to see duddy kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it, and instead substituted the gravy train. we were terribly disappointed that we weren't going to be able to see the much hyped duddy kravitz, and had heard nothing of the gravy train, and have heard nothing of it since.however, i recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as i recall, it was quite humorous. would love to find it on tape.

these immortal lines begin the jack starret directed masterpiece,'the dion brothers'. the plot centers around two blue collar west virginian brothers (stacy keach and frederic forrest) who commit robberies in hopes of using the money to open a seafood restaurant!!? what follows is quite an adventure, and many comedic events ensue. the action scenes are all top notch and consist of some nicely realized shootouts. the latter of which is absolutely amazing and occurs in an abandoned building being demolished by a wrecking ball! the film was written by now famous director terrence malick and features an early appearance by margot kidder. all in all, an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the finest action/comedy hybrids every made. hopefully it gets a decent widescreen dvd release soon.

another one that slipped by the radar of most anyone. this little b produced gem is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive, that a dreadful feeling about the lack of cojones in today's cinema slowly overtakes your body. the final set piece is so innovative in its setting and style that it prefigures everyone from tarantino to john woo. oh, and if you think "dying lines" are all cliche, wait for the dying line of ff. a piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart. a true pleasure. seek it and see it. you won't be sorry.

i managed to record the dion brothers, off broadcast tv, (with the commercials), back in the early 80s. i've loaned it to many friends, all of whom agree it's one of the best b "bandit" movies ever made. one day, while walking to my nyc apartment, i saw stacy keach shooting a scene for his tv series, mickey spilane. we had a moment to chat, and i told him how much i enjoyed the dion bros, and considered it a pure classic. he thanked me, and said it was one of the best, and most memorable film experiences of his career. he was very friendly, and sincere, and i was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan. this is one classic that needs to be on dvd.

i happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie,late night about 8 years ago. what a wild and funny 45 minutes.i was absolutely knocked out by chase-shoot-out at the end that takes place at night ,inside an old hotel that's being torn down with a wrecking ball....incredible. i vaguely remember stacy keach ,stealing a cop car, faking being a cop and strong arming some winos....wino to keach"hey,why ya hasslin us?...keach"it's my job".you're correct. they don't make them like that anymore.great movie. the golden70's...hopefully it will see the light of day as a dvd along with other lost treasures...hickey and boggs being one such.

considering this film was released 8 years before i was born, i don't feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time. back in january of 98 though, i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin,texas. the particular theme of films this night was "neglected 70's crime films" and boy was her right. "the gravy train(or the dion brothers, as it appeared this print)" was an absolute gem. wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it. in the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.

this interesting lost film (written by terence malick) stars stacy keach and frederic forrest as two wacky, southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant. margot kidder was never prettier and forrest should have been nominated. originally titled the dion brothers, this light-hearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy! where is this film? i've been searching for it for 30 years. keach was still great back then and i'm surprised it doesn't have more of a cult following (maybe it does). these guys are a crack-up with more ambition than brains, but totally lovable dudes!. a 7 out of 10. if you can dig it up somewhere, you'll have fun.

unfortunately this original mix of action and laughs is kept from cinema fans as it sits rotting in the columbia vaults for all eternity. a shame since this may be jack starrett's strongest film and features a witty script by a young terrence malick and fully realized performances by its two leads stacey keach and frederic forrest who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant. many standout scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razor, and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it's being torn down by a wrecking ball!

great adaptation of the christie novel. surprising attention to authentic period details for the time (many films of the mid-1970s-early 80s that try to do 1920s-early 30s look far too mid-70s-early 80s for my liking, so expected the worst here, and was gladly proved wrong)the costumes and sets are very well done. i liked this production very much ¬ñ largely due to the adorable francesca annis' portrayal of a carefree bright young lady "frankie" and james warwick's charming bobbie. the pair would go on to portray christie's tommy & tuppence, which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared frankie and bobby to her earlier characters of tommy & tuppence. the supporting characters were equally well done ¬ñ the over the top mrs. rivington (acted by miss marple-to-be joan h.) and "badger" is played perfectly as the post wwi, "bertie wooster type."

i saw this television version of a christie mystery story when it was shown back on channel 5 in new york city in 1980. at the time i was surprised it was not shown on channel 13, the public television station that showed most of the masterpiece theater programs, but (aside from some dorothy sayers "lord peter wimsey" stores, and the moonstone) the bbc productions rarely dealt with british detective stories. another series, the rivals of sherlock holmes had dealt with stories set in the victorian and edwardian period, so a period charm was involved in getting those stories onto channel 13.the plot of why didn't they ask evans? dealt with a young couple stumbling upon a dying man who's only last words are the question of the title of the story (the novel was originally called why didn't they ask evans?, but subsequently was retitled the boomerang clue). the young couple start investigating the murder, and trace the crime to a set of people who surround a questionable doctor (eric porter). despite the warnings of the father of the hero (john gielgud), the hero (james warwick) and the heroine (francesca annis) pursue their investigation - even as it gets murkier and more dangerous. the death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers as the killer starts looking into silencing the two amateur detectives.it's not a bad film, although i agree it was a bit too long for a single night's entertainment (if it had been done like later miss marple episodes with joan hickson, or the hercule poirot episodes, in two parts it would have been better). but it has it's strengths. one is the proper use of porter as chief suspect, and a clever scene later in the film where he appears to be spying on the young couple who are investigating the mystery. if you stick to the film, you will be in for a fair surprise later on.but it has one failing. when dealing with a christie novel the figures in the story have to be in a rigid schedule of movements so that the reader might be able to figure out what the secret of the plot is. i will only add that if you hear the dialog at one point, and how a little boy was almost killed (but wasn't), then you will find all the parts of the story coming together, and what the villain's motivations were.except for that and the lengthy time the telefilm takes to tell it's story, it is quite a good film, and worthy as one of the best programs based on a christie story in the period when their was a sudden renaissance in films based on her novels.

this bbc version of an agatha christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely. christie's books tend to move at a gentle, sometimes even sedate pace, and "evans" is one that certainly does. it also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot. this version is extremely faithful to the book, which results in a very slow, involved story. as a christie fan, i gave it 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action-free story. i appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the bbc did for its later christie productions much more.in the end, this movie is a leisurely pleasure, highlighted by the breathy waif francesca annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off james warwick very well.

brilliant work. marvelous actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters .all unforgettable parts in a more than intriguing and capturing action ¬ñthriller. the casting is perfect. both from the side of the stars like :armand asante, bernhardt, kier ,denier. but as well for new faces .i was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy gang member- mustafa. you trust each one from the turkish gang. very convincing is michael barral and all white power followers. i admire the music beat of the main theme of "children of wax".this sound track is a charming mixture of turkish, hard rock and udo kier's humming¬Ö and in the same time children of wax "a tale focusing on racial conflicts .the intolerance and brutality between the skinheads and the turks.

i have never read sarah water's book. although i have not read the book, the 3 hour movie is very interesting. it begins with an interesting storyline with a twisted ending. i have to say these 2 actresses are amazing. sally hawkins is stunning successfully portrayed the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love. their romance slowly blossoms as they spend more and more time together. the love making scene is very tender and emotional, well acted. the end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after all they have been thru, which is a bless. overall, it is a great movie to see, a very interesting plot with excellent performances.

after watching tipping the velvet by sarah waters i decided to watch fingersmith, the characters were just as good in both performances, though missing rachael stirling in the adaptation of fingersmith.the story line overall was of a good choice, the twisting and the unravelling of the characters were amazing! excellent watch only missing rachael stirling!if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn't one of the best films to watch. it takes on a different spin from tipping the velvet but just as good. would recommend it to everyone!

london 1862, a young orphan named susan trinder (sally hawkins) grows up amongst the petty thieves known as fingersmiths, under the guidance of mrs. suckerby (imelda staunton).one evening, richard "the gentleman" rivers (rupert evans) pays them a visit.rivers has an elaborate plan to defraud the wealthy heiress, maud lilly (elaine cassidy).susan agrees to help for a cut of the money, and is quickly installed as muad's maid.upon arriving, she discovers that maud is virtually a prisoner in her own house, as uncle chritopher (charles dance) controls every detail of her life.as the plan begins to unfold, susan finds herself developing an intimate relationship with the lady of the house.adapted from the novel by sarah waters.

the story was well plotted and interesting by itself. however, it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. to avoid that, i am not going to talking the story here.i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah water's book, as compared with the previous one "tipping the velvet". i read the book first and then watched the dvd later. the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. of course, due to the time limitation, the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book. therefore, it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr. ibbs's place and those after that (even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene). despite that, the film actually did a good job in representing the story. it really worth watching. it's still unclear when bbc-america can broadcast this film. that's pity.ps: noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses.

i'm not exactly sure why i ordered "fingersmith" from netflix -- probably, because i enjoy bbc dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. i had no idea what i was about to see. the plot, which i will only describe in general so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review, has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the rockies, of the sort that customarily appear in "caper" movies. they are very unusual in a period drama. not having read the novel (and i do not intend to do so), i was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment on the dvd and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns. nonetheless, it is extremely well acted by the two young principals (by sally hawkins,in particular, as sue and by elaine cassidy as maud) and, in key supporting roles, by imelda staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by charles dance as the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and who rescues young maud from the mad house where her mother lived to be his secretary. the lesbian affair between maud and sue is the "big news" in the movie, but really not its centerpiece. the centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that maud is due on her 21st birthday. the turns and twists in the plot add tension, though not much credibility, to the movie. however, no viewer is likely to doubt that maud and sue will somehow end up together -- improbably -- as the credits roll. although one has been raised as a ady, and serves a collector of pornography, and the other is a pickpocket posing as a lady's maid, the author obviously means for them to live together in the end. it's a bit difficult to swallow, since each has conspired to cheat the other. despite these reservations, i liked movie well enough. it does not quite deserve the praise that others have lavished on it. the most fearsome and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to london to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. sally hawkins (sue) is a very impressive young actress, able to convey her character's cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and her eyes. no doubt we'll see more of her. i certainly hope so.

wow! where to start?this adaptation of sarah waters' third novel is one of my all-time favorite movies!!!!!i'm not to big on fiction novels (seriously i never read fiction), but the book is just as fabulous as the film! or should i say the film is just as fabulous as the book?! i just love this story!!!!!anyway, i put off watching this three hour long film (2 part series on dvd, 3 part series on tv/book) for about a year and half. it simply did not look that interesting...boy was i so wrong! i became immediately immersed into the rich and suspenseful plot...utterly enthralled! just like the book, you cannot stop watching/reading. it grasps your attention for the entire 3 hours...and when it does end...you wish it hadn't.the story just flows so beautifully and you'll be wondering where the time went.the lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake! the parts i love most are the subtle facial expressions and glances/eye contact between the two characters. you really feel their desire for one another and yet they cannot act upon it.....until they must. may i point out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously, at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story, but it is most certainly not what the whole movie is about. for me that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing. i've never read or heard of anything like it. sarah waters is pure genius!the twists and turns it takes leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. seriously! my hands were clasped on to my couch with every surprising plot twist and i even yelled out several times ("oh my god! no way! that did not just happen! did it?")...i never do that!the only negative thing i have to say about this film is that i wish they'd added more from the book. but obviously having the adaptation be restricted by time they couldn't add everything that i would've liked. how awful it is though...i think i'm just being brutally selfish now...forgive me. the last 20 minutes does seem a little rushed. however, they put all the important bits in where even if you only watch the film and choose not to read the book you will be most satisfied with the outcome. the actors are just superb! brilliant even! sally hawkins (sue) and elaine cassidy (maud) have such great on screen chemistry they steam up your television set. simply electric! the emotions...the desperation...the struggle each of them feel is expressed seemingly effortless by these wonderfully talented actresses. rupert evans plays such a good bad guy as gentleman. i found myself seething every time he came on screen, but loving it because he's just so damn cute and somehow still charming even though you want to wring his neck. imelda staunton gives yet another fantastic performance as mrs. sucksby. she's such a warmhearted actress you cannot help but love her...even when the character she's playing isn't as delightful. everyone else in the cast were perfect! they really represented the characters well and were just as i imagined them to be after reading the book.this is a must see for any film buff! actually, anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book! chances are you won't be disappointed!10/10 stars from me! there are only four other films i have given that same rating too. its very rare for me to actually enjoy a film so much that i give it 10/10. this is one of those films. fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!

bbc's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by sarah waters..."fingersmith". life is tough without money, especially in dickensian london. dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas.is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? elaine cassidy as "maud lilly" and sally hawkins as "sue trinder" both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question ... of each other ...whilst rupert evans shines as the delightfully bad "gentleman".. with great support from imelda staunton's "mrs sucksby", david troughton's "mr ibbs" and charles dance's "uncle". the plot twists and turns and i wasn't sure i could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way... but somehow.. i do care... and thats because of the quality of the performances... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate... betrayal .. confusion.. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the dvd and enjoy.( elaine cassidy is just great in this.. gorgeous in fact.... i have to declare i am in her fan club... hi elaine : )

this movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind,. a victrion age story of love, and, grit. the depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love, and hate, with some very interesting twists, this is a must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences, but, for all viewers. i can't say much more or i will spoil the experience for a new, young audience who might just be coming out. another fine work for sarah waters. it also is a great way for sally hawkins to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another sarah waters work, in "tipping the velvet".. it is also a must see..

the chemistry between sally hawkins and elaine cassidy was incredible. they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles. imelda staunton played the conniving mrs. sucksby brilliantly. despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist, she somehow managed to have you sympathizing with her in the end. rupert evans played the slime-ball gentleman with sheer charm and snark. he was a scene stealer. the story itself was very unique, as was the manner in which it was told. the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful. there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story. a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb.

historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can't be beat. so while i'm not a huge fan of the genre, i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's british and with decent actors.i have never read anything by sarah waters, which is of course something i should do. hence i didn't really know what to expect from this. i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated. without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted. although there were almost a twist too many somewhere, it took me a minute to get everything straight.production values are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half-hour. that might just be me though, i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished. all in all though, this is a fairly enjoyable three hours. i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.

this tv adaptation of sarah waters' novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it. not since "tipping the velvet" (also highly recommended) have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses, this time by sally hawkins and elaine cassidy. they acted with their souls, and this is what gets across to the audience! the supporting actors were well chosen, too, they made a great ensemble.for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no, this is only one part. the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. and the plot has some further surprising twists. so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well.

i never dreamed when i started watching this dvd that i would be totally mesmerized by it within minutes. the story was completely absorbing and entertaining. the acting was superb. the biggest surprise of all was how i would be so completely enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen. their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender, romantic, delightful, vicariously enthralling love scenes i have ever witnessed on film. i literally stopped breathing. i could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. with no nudity or graphic sex, they conveyed more passion and titillation than any american production could ever hope to evince. bravo to the author, the screenwriter, the director and the cast.

i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it. i loved the storyline and the actors. it has a little of everything. i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story. it has so many surprises along the way. i highly recommend it. in fact, i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book. i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie. i also wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie. i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. it has become my favorite movie. i am now a sarah waters and elaine cassidy fan!!

this movie was incredible!!!! i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd. it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting. the acting by elaine cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally hawkins. the storyline is rich with plausible occurrences as well as fresh ideas from the present.there is truly something about ms. cassidy's eyes that leaves "a mark." this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the 'victorian times' and how we view that society. a very worthwhile watch.

it is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. i read the book before, and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. the qualities of the book haven't been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue's point of view then from maud's one. the main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.for each of her books the author, sarah waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century. while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.

this was indeed an amazing adaption. i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline. but as soon i watched the second and then the third instalment i was just blown away. i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book. from the moment i opened it i was hooked, i just couldn't put it down. i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all. i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds, you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story. they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time. but considering only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot i think it was done excellent. it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly. and the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing! the love making scene was pure beautiful. it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption! i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the tipping the velvet adaption quite enjoyable. but when i read and watched fingersmith i knew none of her previous novels/adaption could beat it. sarah waters has indeed exceeded herself this time! i recommend that you watch this adaption! if tipping the velvet wasn't your thing, then don't let it put you off this one. fingersmith is a whole new ball game. it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love, greed and betrayal...a must see!

i'm usually disappointed by what the media dubs "lesbian" movies these days: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women, but end up with men at the end; ridiculously good-looking women who only get w/ each other to turn men on, etc.thankfully, fingersmith is on a very high pedestal above this garbage. it is a credible love story acted marvelously by every cast member, down to the least of the supporting actors. aside from having a very engaging central conflict, the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to cassidy and hawkins.i have also seen tipping the velvet, but fingersmith is far superior to the former, both in character/conflict development and the quality of the acting.fingersmith is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch, offering lesbians everywhere a great follow-up act to bound.

i had never read any of sarah waters' novels, or watched tipping the velvet. i only heard about fingersmith when i was flipping through "the l word" websites. the storyline of fingersmith interested me, yet i passed it away, thinking "lesbian in victorian period, that never ends well, i have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go no where"however, during christmas my local dvd store gave fingersmith a discount, i brought the dvd, and my life has never been more colourfulthis mini series deserves to be cherished and praised. the acting is so great that i call it rare. sally hawkins, elaine cassidy, rupert evans, imelda staunton, and many more that i can't name all, brought light and darkness to their characters. just by a little gesture, a little look, a little touch, they made their characters real and as a viewer, i couldn't help it but take them home, keep them close. fingersmith, sets in victorian area, is a story of sue-a thief who loves and lives with her "family" of pick-pockets. little did she know that her fate is linked to maud lily-a somewhat shy, timid girl grows up in a mansion miles and miles away. maud's mother left her a fortune, but maud herself can't touch it, unless she married. worst of all, maud's uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her prisoned in the house. enter mr gentlement, a charming, good-looking thief with a heart as bad as any. he wants maud's fortune for himself, and in order to do so he sets sue up as maud lily's maid, asking sue to persuade maud to elope with him. as time goes by, things would be simple, if sue didn't fall in love with maud. and things would be simple, if the story was what i have just told. i do not wish to spoil, so i would like to stop there. but i can asure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened. once it happened, you then question what would happen next. on top of that, the story is filled with passion unlike any others. there are no self-searching, sexuality questioning, "oh my god do i like girls" moments, because the girls in fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care. the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. weeks have passed since i watched "fingersmith", yet maud's eyes still haunt me, and sue's words still warm my heart "you pearl, you pearl, you pearl", she said. and such pearl it is.

having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill. however, the story is so clever i could never tire of it. sally and elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters. i fell in love with the story and the women all over again.beautiful to watch thanks to direction, settings and costumery. despite the plot speed of television, i don't feel that anything important was lost in transit. it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomach-trembling moments. enjoyed it thoroughly. this is the kind of television i have been waiting for.

i love sarah waters's fingersmith, and was worried about the tv adaptation as i'd been disappointed by the bbc's version of tipping the velvet (which although beautiful to look at was let down by keeley hawes not being able to sing, and rachael stirling not being able to act). fingersmith is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours.i needn't have worried. the adaptation was excellent, very little cut out, and went along at a cracking pace (although i did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book, would you miss things?). it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book.the acting was stellar. sally hawkins acting her heart out as sue trinder, and elaine cassidy, a slow burner, who by the end of the story was incandescent as maud lilley. the love, the passion, the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform, were written on their faces. it was a joy to watch.i hope rachael stirling was watching: that's how you play a sarah waters character!

having read all of sarah waters books i was eagerly looking forward to a bbc adaptation of fingersmith. especially since tipping the velvet had been done so well by old familiar andrew davies.i was not disappointed with the results, in fact i think this might be on a par with ttv; both romantic and entertaining. and not as so many ignorant people would have you believe, a pointless lesbian romp. having been a fan of elaine cassidy's since seeing her guileless turn in felicia's journey i thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as maud. her transformation was believable and impressive to watch. i recognised sally hawkins as zena blake from tipping the velvet, a small role primarily so i didn't have as many expectations but she was astounding in the role of sue trinder. her eyes were mesmerising conveying everything from rage to absolute despair. the two of them acting together, combining these talents made this drama unmissable. of course imelda staunton was amazing as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast were all of a high standard. even the direction from the fairly unknown aisling walsh used contrasting yet beautiful shades of blue for briar and brown for london.however as much praise must be given to ransley the script writer. to turn a 600 page book where every line is of the highest quality into a three hour extravaganza is a huge feat. he illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace whilst giving us plenty of back-story and character development at the same time. he has my full admiration.in conclusion, a brilliant adaptation where all involved gave 100% and making this one of the best bbc dramas i've seen.

haggard: the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn, and his girlfriend who cheated on him, also with the help from his two friend, 1. a skate boarder who lives for nothing, and, 2. a trying-to-be funny scientist (which doesn't really work) played by bam margera and brandom dicamillo.the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass, etc, but to say it was written by bam margera and co. this is a very weak attempt, seems to me like it was written when he was bored, or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to.the films also stars bam's girlfriend jennifer rivell, who plays glauren, ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him, again very bad acting by jennifer, another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a.k.a hellboy, played by rakeyohn, which his character does not seem to be with the story, again bad acting, also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring. but worst of all, is raab's character, the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, also i think he could have been improved! overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story, like in one scene, it would be on one certain character, a minute later, a different scene, different character.to say that this is supposed to be a film, sort of a documentary, its not played by the characters as a documentary, the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time.towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn, although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon.in conclusion this film is ok, if you laugh at things that aren't very funny, stupid stunts, terrible acting and the occasional nude scene!, also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music! 7/10

alright, let me break it down for ya... haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see. it's got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie, basically, if you've seen jackass or the cky series, you'd know what to expect for humor, considering it has most of the people from those movies. overall... i just had to give it a 10/10 because its one of my favorite movies of all time.~f0rs4k3n(p.s.) haggard rules!

i just bought this movie yesterday night, and i love it. everyone did great acting in it, especially ryan dunn and bam margera. the whole plot was great, and as dunn said in the extras on the dvd, they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again. this movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies! i can't stop replaying scenes over and over again, just to see it again. i've never done that with any other movie. i would definitely recommend this to other people to watch, because it is such a great movie, and if you like bam margera, it's a perfect movie for you!! the little montages that they show in between every scene are just great. i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie. they are very sad, with mostly music from the band 'him,' which of course is my favorite band.

i bought this movie just to see bam because i was really loving him, but after seeing this i don't like him much. i mean, his acting was good and everything i guess, but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself, "alright, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now can we get back to ryan dunn?" dunn, rake, and brandon really made the movie in my perspective.i noticed that jenn rivell, (obviously), and missy rothstein were both in haggard, but who bam was dating at the time? anyways, i actually enjoyed haggard and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen. it's sort of in it's own category.

while some of the things in haggard are dumb and unnecessary, the overall package is good. haggard follows ryan dunn and his friends valo (bam margera) and falcone (brandon dicamillo) trying to win back glauren (jenn rivell), ryan's ex. the story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of jackass or viva la bam, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story.and, for all the bam fan boys (and girls) there are multiple sequences of bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even don vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll.if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape bam's craziness, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. there are some truly funny scenes in this film.

yes, i felt like i had been gutted after first seeing it. but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation. i won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area i want to touch on... **spoilers** why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. i must disagree. watch the scene again. huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. the student is quite an expressive girl (crying & vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of huppert's character. there is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. the mother, visibly upset, states "we gave up everything so she could study piano" and huppert immediately snaps "you mean she gave up everything, don't you."so it was my thought that huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. she didn't want the girl to end up like her, repressed & hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago, before things grew bad. maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age. is she ruining the student's life, or simply freeing her?for me, that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film. brilliant.

this movies made me suffer and i loved it! loved it! it haunted me for days. i think erika is the kind of character you simultaneously loathe and lament. the most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film. this is the best of haneke's work so far. he is the only living director to redefine pace since kubrick. the violence in this film is gorgeous. in a word, the film is about self-hatred. in a sentence, the film is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and finding that that is a hopeless hope.

reading through the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of la pianiste. i find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by isabelle huppert. huppert is gripping - she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge, full of self-hate and delusion.the film is wonderfully paced and judged. it would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store for instance. somehow, huppert is able to carry it off, partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable.don't ignore this film. it is one of the most startling and engaging films (and performances) i have seen.trust boris!

if it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality. professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. her outward expression projects her desire. that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.along comes talented, charming, handsome young walter klemmer (benoit magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. he wants to become her student so as to be close to her. she rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in. he falls in love with her. again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.the question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? the sadist or the masochist? indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? it is hard to tell. is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. she is a sex extreme freak. she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. actually that isn't even true. she says she doesn't care what others think. she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. love, she calls it. for her sex and love are one and the same.at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything. how ironic such a superfluity is to her. how gratuitous the comment.the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within). he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. this is particularly important in the scene in which erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. we don't need to see any more.the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. what matters to her is the performance and the challenge. no part is too demanding. no character too depraved. it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. she is always fascinating and nearly flawless. she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker (la dentelli√®re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme, a parisian apprentice hairdresser. her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (hollywood could never make a movie like this.) in the american cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in la c√©r√©monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.do see this for isabelle huppert. you won't forget her or the character she brings to life.

overall i found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and weak second half. contains spoilers the film is divided in 2 parts. i thought the first half of the pianist was terrific. we meet erika kohut (wonderful isabelle huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. she is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. we understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... this first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.then comes walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by benoit magimel). though he gets to feel erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks erika's fortress. he loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). this is the second half of the film, very touching as we see erika's inability/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. this second half seemed less mastered by haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.of course, this is a crude film at least in the french version: you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. the much talked-about fellatio scene between magimel and huppert was quite good i thought, and is central to understand erika's sick relation to love. as to the actors, huppert is marvelous all through the film, magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and girardot (the mother) is excellent.

first of all, i must say that i love this film.it was the first film that i saw from director micheal haneke and i was impressed that how good the direction was good !haneke surely knows how to direct actors. what i found intresting is also haneke's scenario. at first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. then you realise that she has a mother who is a controle freak and is too much present in her life. now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. and then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. she can't controled herself anymore.the roles are very complexed and difficult to play, but isabelle huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at cannes festival. benoit maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by huppert's performance.there is one thing that i found strange in the scenario is how the character played by magimel is not very credible. he is too talented! it is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study... it think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw.i just saw the movie once, so i can't do a very complete critic, because i didn't analysed the movie. i like what i saw ! so i give the film a 8.5/10oh yeah... as for the end, haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. a motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but haneke does it with style and precision, that is why his film is better than baise-moi for example.vince

i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film. having read the book, being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like (similar to hubert selby's writing) i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this. isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well, with so much disregard for their own reputation or image. there is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness, hurt and pain. there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time. maybe this is not realistic - although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this - but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear. i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it.it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end. btw, her male counterpart is very well acted as well (and i think well chosen, too).

isabelle huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse. she lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist. the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.' these characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.the piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her. they start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.the film ties itself to the female lead. isabelle huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher. she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses. as a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.this is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. the camera work also suits the film. there are what i can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about. this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film. but, be brave - have the guts to go and see it. this is a very private look into essentially one person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense....there are no car chases in this film!

at the end of my review of cache, i wrote that i was intrigued with haneke as a film maker. this is what led me to get the dvd for la pianiste, which i just finished watching about a half hour ago.it's all been expressed, here at imdb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like huppert's erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. she's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. i think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, i mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. by the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe.i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading sub-titles. that has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and i've seen quite a few. in this film, like cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether huppert's character is alive or dead. after experiencing la pianiste, when it comes to michael haneke, i am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.

first of all, those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film. even those, like me, who are desensitized to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should beware. i'm not telling you to steer away from the film, but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material. definitely not a pleasing film to watch, but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value. but i must admit, when i watched the film for a second time, i had to skip to the next chapter when the "razor blade scene" came up. the main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters i can think of, but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act. in one scene, she stuffs broken glass in one of her student's jacket pocket after being dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience. the student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood-stained hand. next to the razor blade scene, that disturbed me most. the student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she. when she gets word that her daughter won't be able to play, she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured, being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an overachiever. though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part, i felt more needed to be explained about isabelle huppert's character. when a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself, you want to understand the root of the problem. the movie establishes that she wants desperately to be loved. then why the hateful attitude towards everyone? why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? the acting is terrific and i liked the glossy, stylized lighting. altogether, it's not a film i'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained, but as i said it's very intriguing. and i'm sure if i watched it a few more times, i'd be able to spot certain subtleties that'll shed more light on aspects of the film i didn't realize initially. my score: 7 (out of 10)

as with all haneke films, make your own decision--don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself. isabelle huppert is stunning in this film--combined with haneke, these two never pull their punches. haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy, benoit magimel, but this is an anti-romance as much as funny games was an anti-thriller. you'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised western civilization is or has become. people may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what solondz did in happiness a few steps further. while grounded in reality, much of what erika (huppert) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor. i'm not recommending it but i wouldn't dissuade you either...it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression--that's no surprise.

after i saw "la pianiste" several years ago, i said to myself that i would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character, erika kahut out of my mind. the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. i read the book "the piano teacher" by elfriede jelinek, the controversial nobel prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it i saw the film again. second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as "le pianiste". three actors gave outstanding performances. franz schubert's piano music, "soaked in the morbid humanity", is another bright star of the movie.i only have one problem with haneke's vision. there is a scene in the film where haneke made some changes to erika's character comparing to the novel. in the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her, was in a letter. as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him. she kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. it tried to make erika sympathetic (and of course, huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.

erika kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. at the start of the film, we see her arriving home late. when her older mother protests, erika goes into a frenzy, attacking the older woman without pity. erika, as it turns out, is a musical teacher of a certain renown in the conservatory where she teaches. when we next see her, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time, and hers. the same goes for the insecure anna, a talented girl who erika hates, maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote.at the end of the day, we watch erika as she goes into an amusement area and proceeds to one of the cabins where pornographic material is shown. erika is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen. on another occasion, erika comes to a drive-in where a movie is in progress. her attention goes toward a parked car in which, two lovers are performing a sex act. the camera lingers on erika as she is lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing, until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. erika flees horrified she's been discovered.when a wealthy couple invites erika to perform in a recital in their opulent home, she meets an eager young man, walter, who is related to the hosts. walter is immediately taken with erika's playing; the young man is a talented pianist himself. his eagerness to compliment erika is met with skepticism on her part. walter decides to audition for erika's master class, and is accepted.thus begins walter pursuit of erika, who is taken aback when she realizes what the young man's motives really are. in turn, erika, begins to fantasize about walter in ways that only her mind could, imagining what she would like him do when, and if, they get together. walter gets turned off by the letter erika has written to him, detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man.the film's ending, reminded us of the last sequence of mr. haneke's current "cache". we are taken to a concert hall where erika is going to perform. she is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of walter, who goes on into the hall without noticing her. erika's expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film. as she flees the lobby area after inflicting a wound on herself, the camera abandons her and concentrates on the building's facade that seems to stay on the screen for a long time."la pianiste" is a personal triumph for isabelle huppert. this magnificent actress does one of her best appearances on the screen, guided by the sure hand of michael haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. ms. huppert's works with economic gestures, yet, she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her erika.the supporting cast does wonders under the director's guidance. annie girardot, always excellent, is perfect as erika's mother. she seems to be the key of whatever went wrong with her daughter. there is a hint of incest that is played with subtleness in the context of the film. benoit magimel is perfectly cast as walter. this young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man, so in love with a woman that is possessed by demons, that he'll never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal manner.michael haneke films are always disturbing to watch, yet they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men don't. the magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by schubert and schumann, two composers that are erika's own favorites. the movie is helped tremendously by christian berger's cinematography.

in the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)'s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer. within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters. we are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal. but the trend in french cinema being what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction, and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. we are drawn to her suffering and, at least initially, wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius, particularly in the composers she admires. the piano teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch. the scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous. a great film it may be, but mainstream viewing it is not.

a very interesting documentary - certainly a lot more than sideways, a pseudo wino drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. according to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on parker - only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: robert parker of massachussets and michel rolland, a french wine industry expert based in bordeaux and also known as a "flying winemaker". the director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of france, from sicily to argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the mondavi family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing. a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made documentray.

i was expecting a lot from this movie, and i can say i haven't been disappointed. first of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places. the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too, in particular hubert de montille. the shooting may be confusing, the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds. you may not like it, but i don't consider it as a defect.the themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well, since globalization isn't the only issue discussed. but nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along. a great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are, avoiding a clich√© "good against evil". this could be the main difference between "mondovino" and michael moore's documentaries; nossiter's point of view appears in a subtle way, through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. the richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters, the history of long-time wine-making families, such as the de montilles, the mondavis, the antinori and the frescobaldi. nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families, rather than just being a business and an industry. this movie doesn't make you want to drink wine, but certainly make you want to discover vineyards and wine-makers.i watched this movie as a student in enology, and let's just there are many ways to learn. i give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite his technical particularities.

business vs. personal conviction. profit vs. art.as with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes. this is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us, against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold.if you have to remember one thing from this movie, it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves, they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as macdonalds used to do for the fast bite (something parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a burger king sign). "it is all about image" against content as another interviewee says. that is the easy way, the standardized way. easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature, easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again. controlled branded taste is easier.there is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are "levelling" the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the "grey masses". individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck. it is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization, even across the ocean.as in many other areas of today's world, dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all... let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for. too much standardization kills the mind and taste; difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - and not just vacuum-packed "more of the same". standardization sells easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one.on this, i am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy "sante".

i saw this at the london film festival last night, apparently the shorter version. james mcnally's summary of the content of the film is very good. nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation, homogenisation, the effect of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity.the film is shot on hand-held dv which some might find offputting, but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment.despite the sprawling feel of the film, the editing is very sharp, not only giving us a parade of the world's dogs, but also undercutting a number of interviewees' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. to a degree this evoked michael moore's recent work (although nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls' "the sorrow and the pity", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of 'salt of the earth' french peasants as the stars. de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards. we do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo hubert!overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people, and organise our world.

i saw this film at the 2004 toronto international film festival. since i work in the wine business, i had been quite eager to see this documentary, and i wasn't disappointed. reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut, but a ten-part, ten hour series of the film on dvd by next christmas (thinkfilm is distributing it). the bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast. when it was shown in cannes, it was close to three hours long. for toronto, he's cut about half an hour but it still clocked in at 135 minutes. now, for me, that's fine. i love wine and i love hearing about the controversies raging in my business. but not everyone wants that much.nossiter flits around the globe, from brazil to france to california to italy to argentina, talking to wine makers and pr people and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world. the theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic robert parker are forcing a kind of sameness on wine. small local producers are either being bought up by larger conglomerates (american as well as local), or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to suit the palate of mr. parker, who dictates taste to most of the american (and world) markets.it's a complicated subject, and i can understand why nossiter wants to let his subjects talk. there is robert mondavi, patriarch of the napa wine industry, and his sons tim and michael, whose efforts to buy land in languedoc faced opposition from local vignerons and government officials. there is aim√© guibert, founder and wine maker of daumas gassac, iconoclastic opponent of mondavi's plans and crusader for wines that express local terror. there is robert parker himself, expressing some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines that he favours. there is "flying wine maker" michel rolland, consultant for dozens of wineries all over the world, advising them how to make parker- friendly wines. there are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary.if you are a wine lover, you will want to seek out the ten-part series as well as the theatrical version of this film. but even if you're not into wine, the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions. the effects on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored.(8/10)

this film is more than the story of danton. it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system. it probably helped spur the solidarity movement's union activity. it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution. solidarity began the end of the system. this film itself is historical by it's very existence....the rest is history.robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. danton, aka. walensa. when one watches this film, one must remember the snowball which began in poland. actually, it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left.

unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/ this movie provides no background information. we are shown a snapshot of the fall of danton, his mock process and execution but, unless one studied the revolution quite extensively, it is difficult to understand where characters come from ( fouquier-tinville, philippeau, desmoulins, robespierre... ) and thus to appreciate them for what they are: danton and joe blobb could be the same person to the viewer. for example robespierre & desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how robespierre acts. those who know the facts, though, will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors delivering solid acting, no useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times. desmoulins and danton are the best characters, but all do a good job, even the 'demented' saint-just portrayed as sort of psychopath. 'terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance hasn't been fully documented and that -for the most part- were driven by ambition, greed and the settling of personal disputes, fed to ignorant sans-culottes as the next epochal step against tyranny.

i was very curious to see this wajda-depardieu outing, plus the time period is definitely fascinating. being a wajda fan, i was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. the film never really took cinematic flight -- there's no foundation for the animosity between danton and robespierre, etc.basically, the script was weak (adapted from "the danton affair"). and yet, the direction was masterful...it's wajda, afterall! also, there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audience's attention like they should. depardieu comes off as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant danton...not exactly the image we have in mind. woijech pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can't break down. andrzej seweryn and bogoslaw linda pop up ... as bourdon and saint-just...and if you're familiar with wajda, then you'd know them.overall, i was disappointed with this much-lauded film. great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. bad, undynamic script. we need to get in danton (walesa) and robespierre's (general j) mindsets... what are their motivations? eh...who knows? one likes women, the other powders himself? riiight. ok, so if you're looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend "la revolution francaise"...it's in two parts and oh-so-great! excellent performances, in-depth script, juicy tid bits...definitely a satisfying experience!! klaus-maria brandauer is a much better danton than depardieu...the wonderful andrzej seweryn apparently took some notes from "danton" and is brilliant as robespierre. see it! now! as for wajda fans -- you're better off with "man of iron/marble", "promised land", and the like. cheers!!

this is a great movie to look at, since it so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it, in terms of its story. it's an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the character's motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to what.somehow it doesn't make the movie any less great to watch though. it's made with passion and eye for detail. every aspect about the movie is good looking, such as its settings, costumes and camera-work.also the story still works out as powerful, though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information. guess if you're completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular, this movie will be a perfect one for you to watch.it's somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle, without ever stepping too much in detail. often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth. other than that, this movie is still one fine example of french cinema, despite the fact that it's being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as well.g√©rard depardieu is great in his role, though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters. the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one, so this doesn't really ever become a big complaint, other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain points.a great movie that could had been brilliant.8/10

the film tells upon the title role,danton(gerard depardieu),confronting against robespierre(wojciech pszoniak) during the french revolution.the film is based on real deeds,they are the following: danton(1759-1794) as lawyer participated in the overthrowing of the king louis xvi and the proclamation of the republic,being minister of justice in the convention(1792)and founder of cordeliers club.he proposed creation revolutionaries committees as the committee of public salvation which he presided but was substituted by robespierre,starting a period of revolutionary dictatorship known ¬®the terror¬®(1793). besides in the film appear other historic personages as camille desmoulins(patrice chereau,now a famed filmmaker)louis david,saint just(jacobino),tallien..the picture especially narrates the happenings surrounding the facing off of the principal figures,one-time partner revolution ,and posterior execution,although gives results a contemporary parable about the modern poland,thus danton is lech walesa and robespierre is wojciech jaruzelski who was the prime minister imposed the martial law in poland and with similar name than actor played robespierre . gerard depardieu is excellent in the title character and magnificently portrayed, also in secondaries roles are awesome actors as the recently deceased jacques villeret(dinner game,crimen in paradise)and angela winkler(the tin drum). the motion picture is well directed by andrzej wajda ,considered the best polish director.the flick will like to historical cinema buffs.

if there were two parts that the physically towering, ugly-charismatic actor g√©rard depardieu was born, as a frenchman, to play, it must surely have been cyrano de bergerac and the orator georges danton. here he dominates the film both through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice; his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them. danton feasts while the people of paris starve... but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded committee of public safety in the name of 'freedom', and he is presented as the hero of the film -- despite the fact that the source play practically idolises his opponent robespierre!for those who know the characters from history, there is interest to be had in identifying the minor parts: the frog-faced tallien, couthon the cripple, fouquier-tinville the tribunal's prosecutor, the dashing fop st-just, the epic painter david. but the script cuts little slack in this respect; names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all, and there is no hollywood-style 'info-dump' to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context. the film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before, and what will happen after -- sometimes it takes too much for granted, as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the sting to its tail in the fact that robespierre followed danton shortly to the scaffold.considered as a film, it's not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end. the structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial, which, thanks to history, never actually happens. things just fizzle out: there is no revolt, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the victor, there is no triumph on either side. it may be historically accurate, but it's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario -- it seems an odd place to stop. as others have commented, it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the terror and show in apposition the fall of robespierre.

this is one of the best movies on the french revolution ever produced. being a person well versed in the the period i was amazed at the level of detail. the costumes are spot on. even the detailed little day to day items such as ink wells, serving plates etc are all perfect. as an american living in france who has access to the sites in the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the napoleonic alliance i can not over state how impressed i was with the visual accuracy of the film.the dialogue where known is virtual quotations and the where not recorded is in character. i was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on dvd yet. this is how historical drama should be done. must see....

over the years i seemed to have missed this picture of ronald reagan, and due to his recent passing to the big screen in heaven, it was shown on tv recently. this is a great low budget b&w film of the late 1930's, however, it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular time frame. i was surprised at the role ronald reagan,(eric gregg),"the killer's,'64, played in this picture, along with a great veteran film star, sheila bromley,(nona gregg),"nightmare circus",'73, who was a great supporting actor. it was a great film that showed ronald reagan as a very young man reaching for the stars in his career in hollywood at the time. god bless him !

danton was a hero and one of the founders of the french revolution of 1789. this movie is set five years later and the revolution has morphed into something ugly. while initially the revolution promised freedom, at this point the small committee running the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. danton and his friends were angry at how the country wasn't better off in 1794 than it was before they got rid of their king, so they begin criticizing the government. the movie begins as the printer who makes critical pamphlets concerning the government is beaten and his business is destroyed. so much for "liberty, equality and fraternity"! so, as a result of being silenced this way, danton et al begin publicly criticizing the government. eventually, robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his cronies trump up charges, have a show trial and get rid of the dissent. some have mentioned that the polish director, wajda, also intended this to be a criticism of his own nation--which, at the time, was soviet-dominated and very repressive as well. this makes sense as you see the movie unfold--especially when the government destroys all dissent "in the name of the people".the acting is fine, the story compelling and i have no major criticism of the film. however, i really wish the ending had been handled differently. especially because other than history lovers and french people, most probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government. after this purge of danton in april 1794, robespierre himself was executed in july 1794 because the country had just had enough--plus, those surviving frenchmen knew that they, too, would face the guillotine sooner or later if this sick system remained in place. some sort of an epilogue would have been nice--such as showing the soldiers coming for robespierre. he responded by trying to kill himself first, but he only succeeded in blowing off part of his face--still alive, he was guillotined shortly afterward. this would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. however, not showing a connection between danton's death and the fall of the government is an odd thing to omit.

french cinema had always been very strong when comes the time to present historical subjects. 95 % of the time, they never make errors. this film is of one of the best of the genre, due to very very strong acting by depardieu and pszoniak. wajda work, as the director, is truly a wonder. everyone should see this great film.

it would seem a given, but if a viewer forgets context, he risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment.it is easy to carp, from the lofty heights of the 21st century, at styles and prices of the great depression years; but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word, "context," and better understand and, thus, enjoy "accidents will happen." among the actors, ronald reagan again showed himself a good-looking and personable guy, and again gave a right-on performance.a reviewer earlier said gloria blondell played the nasty wife, but that was wrong: she plays the concession-stand clerk who has a crush on the reagan character, eric gregg, but keeps hands off as long as he is married.gloria was cute. not as lushly beautiful as her sister, joan, she was still attractive and a good actress. perhaps her looking somewhat like joan was a detriment to having a more successful career, and it is certainly our loss.sheila bromley was mrs. gregg, and played it well.other actors included dick purcell, and the great earl dwire got to play something besides a villainous cowboy.again, most of the players never attained the "household-name" status many of them deserved, but they by gosh gave good performances here, in a story that is still current.

once again i must play something of the contrarian. most of the reviews for ab tak chappan have been extremely positive. mine is positive, but only slightly. a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a "c" letter grade from me.it seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: one, that ab tak chappan is more realistic than the typical bollywood film, and two, that it is trying to do things differently.the first point i couldn't care less about. i'm not looking for realism in films, and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to be--i'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, although i do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist.for the second point, i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. however, i don't think "originality" versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. a film can be "original" and poor, just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer.ab tak chappan is based on the true story of a mumbai cop named daya naik. naik was an "encounter specialist". encounter specialists, who could be said to be early instantiations of real world "judge dredds", are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue, and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a matter of moments. ab tak chappan follows the story of sadhu agashe (nana patekar), the encounter specialist based on naik. we see him at work, interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. we see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. we see him trying to adjust to a new "commissioner" halfway through the film. and we see his odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster, don zameer zafar (prasad purandhare).all of this has the potential to make a fabulous, gritty film. i agree that it's nice to forgo the typical bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; ab tak chappan producer ram gopal varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. additionally, ab tak chappan has some good performances--patekar almost gives off a death wish (1974)-era charles bronson vibe. it also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective, for example. it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional indian instruments and modalities. the violence is well done and gritty.there is also decent exploration of subtexts, including the morality of (having) encounter specialists, the idea of following orders, and so on. the encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. more poignantly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and, say, members of a country's military, and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to.but (you just knew there was a "but" coming, didn't you?) director shimit amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters, far too much sprawl, and that moves a bit too slow. all of these problems may be due to amin and crew looking at the godfather films, which ab tak chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to, although from a policeman's perspective.most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least, except for agashe and jatin shukla (nakul vaid). for one, narayan, i didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. his name is mentioned a number of times, but i'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and i'd have to start all over figuring out who narayan was.the same thing happened with agashe's first commissioner. the film was already far into the new commissioner before i could figure out the relationships. it seems like there are new characters in every scene. we never learn the stories of most of them. while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders), since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists, either, it's difficult to find characters to care about, and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film.the primary villain is zameer. but until about halfway through the film, there's no indication of this. he doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film, and he's literally "phoning his performance in"--he's in another location (dubai), communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. we don't actually see zameer doing much. to an extent, the film depends on a couple "twists" that necessitate not showing zameer doing a number of things, but we could see him do other things, and a lot of the other villains could have been left out.that would have tightened up the film a bit, making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. this is not an action-packed film by any means. for at least the first 45 minutes or so, i found myself admiring ab tak chappan's considerable style, but saying, "okay, get on with the story already".

ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai, india. sadhu agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, imtiaz, becomes frustrated by sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india. the camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. the acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, shimit amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. nevertheless, ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making.

a really realistic, sensible movie by ramgopal verma . no stupidity like songs as in other hindi movies. class acting by nana patekar. much similarities to real 'encounters'.

as a lesbian, i am sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on tv as a sad person, forever vacillating between suicide and homicide, but never destined to find happiness? if, like me, you are fed up with hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, you'll breathe a sigh of relief at this delightful offering from the bbc. nan astley is the daughter of an oyster-house restaurateur who "wonders why she can't feel the way she should about freddy" (one of the local lads who has his eye set on her). she falls ¬ñ and falls hard ¬ñ for kitty butler, a male impersonator with a visiting theatre troupe. nan accompanies kitty to london as her dresser¬Ö not everything that happens to nan is pleasant in this story, and some of the things she does are not squeaky-clean either - but she will win your heart, and her story of love triumphant will leave you with a beautiful lump in your throat at the end.if you are a lesbo-hating macho man or a homophobic housewife, or some brand of religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. but if you have a heart, and you believe in love, you will cry at the end as much as i did!

"tipping the velvet" is one of the modern day television productions that prove that some television can be just as good or even better(as this is) than what you see at your local theater. if you want to read the plot, read this and if you want other details skip down to the next paragraph. this is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named nan who works as a naive oyster girl,until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named kitty who dresses as a male for her stage profession. the young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit. soon the both of them embark on a tender affair. kitty eventually becomes enveloped in a marriage of convenience and ravages young nan's heart. from then on, nan works as male impersonated prostitute to men looking to have sex with boys, then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and sadomasochistic diana where nan experiences severe emotional abuse. when that ends badly, nan is on the streets again where she recalls a young woman named florence; a good-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. that's where nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame. the region 1 transfer is of exceptional picture quality, there is a very good scene selection, an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist sara waters and the film's writer andrew davies. the sets, costumes, cinematography and music are gorgeous. the acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism, class and originality. i loved the film and the novel. section iii in the film is much different in the film than in the novel, because section iii in the novel is great written down, but isn't screen material. i will be brave and say that i love the films interpretation of it much more. this breathtaking historical ingeniously combines drama, comedy, erotica and romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. for every mature and open-minded adult who has ever felt the pleasures, pains and power of falling in love and living life to it's fullest. a revolutionary production; an absolute must-see!

out of the top 24 lesbian films in my library, i must rate this one as the number one film of all times. this film will go down in history as the best in it's genre. it is a story about a girl (rachael stirling) who goes from riches to rags and from rags to riches, with her first love (keeley hawes) popping in and out of her life. it is set against a victorian background in the 1890's, which makes it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry. this film spared no expense for music and costumes, and the make-up rachael and keeley wore while on stage in the halls only added to the film's diversity.no matter what kind of films you favor, i can guarantee this film will not only amaze you, but will keep your attention through all three episodes. this film will be played and enjoyed for decades to come. the unrated dvd collector's version is a must for anyone's library. rachael stirling and keeley hawes was the best choice for the casting in these two roles, and they played them extremely well.

this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made. following are the plus points of the film...wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.even though the film shows the life of mumbai policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.mind-blowing acting by lead actor nana patekar. one can surely hope that he gets nominated for the best actor for the academy awards.controlled violence. the violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.no stupid songs as in usual indian movies.

satya was excellent.... company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. ab tak chappan however is even more entertaining. the dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. nana pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. as a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on. i've ordered my dvd and can't wait to see it again at home. as a lover of these type of gangster flicks, this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly "non-yash raj" bollywood gangster flick lovers out there.

no music. no stupid masala. a reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in india and based on a real "encounter" specialist in india, daya nayak. that is ab tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead "sadhu agashe" has killed" - well you already know that bit)brilliance exudes nan patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating indian cop. the one liners are just hilarious. the plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. another one of the films from ram gopal vermas the factory. movies which are either decent or really good, ab tak chappan meanders close to very good. but yet remains one of the top 70 films released from india, commercial and artsy included.what is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an indian flick) how the police network works. the cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) the producers are trying for a cannes release, which is interesting. made by debut director shamit aman (i think thats his name).again 55 y.o. nana patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. really good stuff. if you are interested in indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.again patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all great stuff. recommendations: gangaajal, ram gopal verma's company (both indian flicks)

you wear only the best italian suits from armani, hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements. your automobile is the finest that german engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. you're a member of the finest polo clubs, frequently dine at restaurants such as spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber gun. you snow ski in the alps, go deep sea diving in the caribbean, sky dive over the andes, and all the while your hair is never, ever, out of place. you are bond, james bond, the world's most renown spy, favorite son of the good queen, bad boy of the british ss, and perhaps the most desired man in the world. the character of james bond was created by ian fleming, and is the movie industry's longest lasting icon, being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades. the latest man to play the role is pierce brosnan, who took over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in 1996, and made his 007 debut in goldeneye.this is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the nintendo 64. goldeneye, developed by rare for nintendo, has been on the market for some time. its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it.let's face it -- most of the time movie-licensed games are flops. although the two seem like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. games like cliffhanger, true lies, lethal weapon, and not to mention all the star trek flops, are ammunition enough against this mix. and for the record i am not a fan of movie licensed games, especially if i've seen the movie. at least that's how i used to think. in the case of goldeneye, i had more reservations than normal. while not a bad movie, goldeneye the film didn't have that much appeal to it, and i don't rank it in the top ten amongst bond movies. as a game, however, let's just say it's a completely different story.the game is a first-person shooter, and in order to be successful, you'll need at least as much brains as brawn. for those who have seen the movie, which i imagine is most of you reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation. a plot to control the world's most dangerous satellite, goldeneye, has begun in the ussr, and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured. your missions will be many, the danger extreme. you will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. m will brief you as soon as you're ready. good day, james.

i first played this around 98' or 99' when i was with my friends.i thought the game was really great,and loved it.the game is simple.on one player mode,you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city.my favorite was one with a tank.on two player mode,you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight.through out the area you are in,you will find ammo and weapons to help.from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work.again with player two mode,there are lots of places to go,and some to unlock.i find this game really fun,but also very suspenseful.because,you never really know where your opponent is,and it's surprising to see them behind a door where you are going.this game gets ****(1/2) stars or of ***** very good!go play it sometime!

i love the way he experiments. ab tak chappan was a thrill to watch just as much satya and company was. jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and nana patekar was at his best. suchak was really irritating but i think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. i only wish he signs up urmila for his other up coming movies. i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen. i have not seen naach as yet but i am looking forward for it. i for some reason don't find antra maali that exciting to watch on the screen - unlike urmila.

we've all played halo and socom and gta and resi etc. but none of them can stand up to ge007. the game itself is great. i have literally burned out my n64 playing this great game, along with zelda oot. this game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters. on top of that the multi-player is great. the story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more. its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless unlock ables. (cheats, aztec, egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer charries, and the three difficulties as well as the famous '007' difficulty our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you. and with the online capabilities of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style. and when we do its no where near as good as this games. and when you get bored of the story, there are endless mysteries, glitches and easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of. this is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time.

goldeneye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market. if you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular james bond movie, goldeneye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.this is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges. the a.i. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.the introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature. even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head. it is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your james bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts. because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks. aka: you can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, i might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).this is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry. each time i play it i notice aspects that have been replicated in many following fps games. so if you have a nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of goldeneye 007, because trust me, as a bond fan, and a casual gamer i can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of james bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.(also make sure to look out for its sister game, perfect dark, which is also on the n64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)

there isn't much that comes close to the perfect-paced storytelling and suspenseful action-packed levels as "goldeneye". when it came out, it was the greatest game of all-time, and even today, it stays strong.i will admit that this game did get boring after a few months of playing, and by not playing it again until two years later, i was thrust back into its greatest, almost as if i was playing it for the first time again.there are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most of any james bond game to date. probably the most unforgettable one is the tank level, which was likely the most explosive video game sequence at that time. and the first-person shooting as well as usage of q gadgets is what james bond fans are always dying to use.frankly, as a james bond fan, i look for aspects of a true james bond experience, which are now showing up in the ps2 games. so this game, while it has some great action and usable gadgets, i was somewhat expecting a little more, even back in 1997. i also disliked that this game didn't have q or m or moneypenny, or anyone from mi6. while watching the movies, bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. and vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they wound up using. they had the technology. they just didn't use it.probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some ways it follows the story of the movie precisely, and other ways it's incoherent. for example, there are two many levels where you have to protect or save natalya, even though in the movie she can take care of herself. there are also some unnecessary levels, like the boat level where you have to disarm some bombs (which is not in the movie), which adds nothing to the storyline whatsoever. there are even some levels where you rescue natalya, but at the beginning of the next level, she's captured again. how?oh well. even those little things can't really put this game down. and while i do prefer the newer games, this bond experience is definitely one you won't forget.8 out of 10

this is one of my favorite james bond in games because: the missions are fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be hard that makes them fun to do the weapons you use are good. the way james bond look in this james bond games is pretty you can see pierce brosnan in him which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors that played them in the movie. there is no way that you can't have a good time playing this game i loved it.also the game follows the movie pretty much maybe a few added thing but it pretty much follows the movie. also the this james bond game has pretty good graphics for nintendo 64 and to bad there was no voice over actors in this game but who care as long as the game is fun to play.overall score ******** out of **********

007's goldeneye is one of the best n64 releases ever.better than this game? well...star wars: rogue squadron, star wars: episode i-racer and the legend of zelda: ocarina of time are far better and superior games. but i still love goldeneye.this is the best adaptation from a movie second only to star wars adaptations. the story is perfect. it's like you are in the movie itself.the graphics are excellent. the movements are extremely realistic. the enemies' artificial intelligence are the best part in this game. i loved playing the stage in which james and natalya break from the janus base as the goldeneye prepares to burn it. escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult. eluding cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the gameplay.it's also the toughest game i've ever played. n64 games are usually very, very easy. goldeneye is the one exception. i'm still trying to beat the 00 agent difficult level, but winning the easier levels was already a great victory. i loved when alec trevelyan asked: "for england james?". i answered: "no, for me!" it happened just in the moment i blasted him to death. just like in the movie. i love accomplishing every objective.the multiplayer gaming is even better. at first i got killed every holy second. now, i know how to win. i love forcing my playmates by playing at license to kill.the music and sound are astounding. super mario 64 looks like an atari next to this. the only thing i still wanted to hear was the goldeneye theme song, that plays at the end of the movie.after zelda was released, i nearly forgot i still had this game. it's still excellent, even if it's already surpassed. i hope other 007 games are produced.fantastic job rareware! nintendo was very smart to release this game on the n64 exclusively. magnificent job nintendo!

quite simply, goldeneye is the single greatest n64 game to date. the learning curve is just about perfect, and you'll still be playing it with your friends months on, as the multiplayer mode is nothing short of exceptional.the system for acquiring cheats for once requires some degree of skill, rather than simply knowing which buttons to press, and the challenge of aztec on 00 agent level is astonishing.all in all - it's the best game i've ever played on the n64

ever since i've been allowed to play goldeneye once again, it's been impossible to get my mind off it. i'm surprised i could have gone without it. it is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games of all time. i have never played any other shooting games, but i know that this one rules above all. most people blame it for too much violence, but i find that ridiculous. there may be a few graphic antics, but there's far worse out there.most importantly, it's fun. with an awesome arsenal of weapons such as the rc-p90 and the classic golden gun, you'll go through several challenging levels from the movie, completing crucial objectives and fending off swarms of guards. there are tons of awesome cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the true skill. goldeneye is also one of the greatest multiplayer games ever as well. you can choose several characters from the movie, classic villains from old 007 movies (baron samedi, oddjob, may day, and jaws), and guards in the game. chances are you and your partner(s) will be laughing so hard as you blow each other away that you'll look like bart and lisa simpson watching an episode of the itchy and scratchy show. so if you don't have the game, don't rent it: just buy it. it's too good to be true. for cool goldeneye stuff, check out detstar.com's goldeneye website. every james bond lover will dig this game big time.

goldeneye is a masterpiece. the storyline is amazingly depicted, the characters beautifully animated and the weapons are tyte. the storyline is so interesting, even when you complete every single mission, to get more levels you have to beat them on a higher difficulty. and the multiplayer mode is so tyte. you pick the weapons you want to play with, then play. me and the three of my friends, along with my brother, always play goldeneye. if you don't have this game, i suggest you buy it.

this episode introduces us to the formal dress uniforms worn here by captain picard, commander riker, and lieutenant tasha yar. the plot of this episode deals with 2 groups of separate alien delegates, the anticans and the selae who try to capture and eat each other at every turn. the 2 sides really hate each other, and it is up to riker and tasha to contain them and keep them out of trouble.meanwhile a mysterious spacial anomaly goes around the ship injuring and killing a few of the crew members. but at the end of the episode this same spacial anomaly possesses a valuable member of the crowd. will they be able to rescue him so that they maybe able to continue on with their on going mission of space exploration? note: this episode marks irish actor colm meaney's second appearance on tng after "encounter at farpoint." he portrays one of tasha's "yellow-shirted" security guards.

"lonely among us" definitely is one of the best first season episodes. the storyline, although somewhat confusing, creates a lot of suspense, supported by the creepy synthesizer-driven soundtrack. this is a typically "alien body invasion" scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose (the death of assistant chief engineer singh to me was an accident). the two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame (best make-up so far) finally adding a little black humor to the series (the final scene). patrick stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his picard character and exploring some new terrain as does data by posing as sherlock holmes (another all time classic). the special effects are also convincing and director cliff bole did his job well. he is the first one trying to compensate trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks. she does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot. picard's "lightning-scene" on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of star wars "return of the jedi" (which is a personal impression but made me smile).there's also some playing with the lighting of the corridors (simulating night aboard) and the first moving camera, pulling back from picard when he's entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud... nice work. the clever cutting, creating continuing dialog through different scenes (troi's hypnosis report) rounds up the impression of a really well crafted tng episode. the first one, where even wesley crusher seemed almost tolerable... the ending however is a bit confusing, just as if the producers were running out of time. "p for picard" is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer...

i almost stopped watching hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. one exception for this is ramgopal verma movies. this is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. this is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. the adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.you should watch this movie for nana patekar. based on the life of mumbai cop daya naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. the film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist. i rate this as one of the best movie of the year

i remember seeing this a long while ago, and i knew most of the concept, but no detail, so i'm glad i watched it again, from director frank oz (the muppets take manhattan, bowfinger). basically new star cameron drake (matt dillon) has just won the academy award for his latest, where he plays a gay soldier, and he does the usual "thank yous", he even mentions his past school english teacher howard brackett (golden globe nominated kevin kline), and he outs him as gay! howard is determined to clear his name, and get out of the media spotlight as a denying gay man, especially as his marriage to emily montgomery (oscar and golden globe nominated joan cusack) is on the way. so it comes to the wedding day, and when it comes to howard saying yes or no, that is when he outs himself, and admits to himself and everyone, that he is gay. this of course gets him fired as a teacher, but everyone stands at the graduation day to out themselves (in support), and cameron even shows up to clear things up, so that everyone, especially school head tom halliwell (elf's bob newhart) knows it's okay to be gay. also starring tom selleck as peter malloy, debbie reynolds as berniece brackett, wilford brimley as frank brackett, gregory jbara as walter brackett, glenn close, whoopi goldberg and jay leno. the highlight of the film has to be when kline can't help dancing to diana ross's version of "i will survive", that must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. kline is always good, cusack is a surprise oscar nominee, and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy. very good!

nana patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in bombay without a doubt. his recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian. one wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season."shakti-the power" was one of his flicks that was an utter disapointment along with kohram (a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with amitabh bachchan).but patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey. ridding the streets of bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters, patekars character takes control of the screen (and the viewers attention) and never lets go. the editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story.along the same lines as the modern day cult classic "company", the movie is well acted, directed and should have a long shelf life on dvd.the final ten minutes that see nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of hindi cinema classics. won't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick.

howard (kevin kline) teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city. he is finally getting married to emily (joan cusack), much to his parents delight. the town is abuzz, too, because one of its own, cameron (matt dillon) has been nominated for an acting oscar. everyone, including howard and emily, is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner! in his acceptance speech, cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man, in part, because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. you guessed it, its howard! but, howard has never "come out"; in fact, he believes he is straight! with the whole town, and members of the media, waiting and observing the happenings, will howard and emily go ahead and get married? or, is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony? this is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation. as the man-who-did-not-realize-he-was-gay, kline is excellent and touching. the rest of the cast is equally fine, with cusack a stitch as the mixed-up fianc√© and dillon, bob newhart, debbie reynolds, tom selleck, and others on hand to delight the audience as well. the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful. then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. but, the insightful, humorous, and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film's best asset, no doubt. for those who would be offended by a gay-themed film, yes, just skip over this one. but, for everyone who wants to laugh heartily, and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best film out there.

while amiable and amusing for gay audiences, frank oz's film "in and out," about a closeted gay teacher who has been outed on national television by a former student, has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that patronized "the bird cage." although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the movie revolves around kevin kline's howard brackett, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. the movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music, revel in barbra streisand movies, and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation. like "queer eye," the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly, dim witted, and lacking in taste and culture. ok, so "in and out" is only a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt.unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character. howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self-denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. a three-year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks, and watching "funny lady." fortunately, joan cusack plays howard's intended, emily montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. most of the film's funniest moments belong to her, although kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious. he is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. matt dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip from his oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. however, despite the movie's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy romance, and only one male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between michael and fredo corleone in "godfather ii." although well intentioned, "in and out" fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about howard's self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his abrupt and unjust dismissal. not surprisingly, howard's parents, endearingly portrayed by debbie reynolds and wilford brimley, and his students rise to support him. however, the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to howard brackett in the film. the movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived on fast food. despite some good performances and funny situations, "in and out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether they be positive or negative, stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history.

a beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy. there is not a person in the cast who does not acquit himself (or herself) with hilarious distinction. however, the real star of the film is the unseen director, frank oz, who brings all the madcap sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to miss piggy's encounters with kermit the frog. this is a not -to-be-missed film.

the funniest performance was by shalom harlow, as matt dillon's supermodel girlfriend. she was more interesting to me than all the lead actors. this movie got it all wrong; even the most dependable actress of the century, joan cusask, was not able to rise about the ridiculousness of the plot. i did enjoy hearing "macho man" by the village people over the closing credits. the rest of the movie might have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy.

hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers. in condemning homosexuality, the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology. for example, in the 1962 otto preminger melodrama "advise and consent," straight actor don murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle. gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since "advise and consent." in the 1997 movie "in & out," (**1/2 out of ****), heterosexual actor kevin kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day. while the conservative hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in "advise and consent" had to commit suicide, the liberal hollywood of today dictates that the gay english teacher should be embraced rather than maced.basically, "in & out" preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy. director frank oz and scenarist scott rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness. high school teacher howard brackett (kevin kline of "the big chill") will be happy only after he comes out of the closet, just as his once-fat-but-now-thin fianc√©e emily (joan cusack) will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet. ultimately, the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves. the happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor tom selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded commentary.rudnick's lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the oscars when tom hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. in "in & out," cameron drake (matt dillon), a blond, brad pitt style bimbo type actor, wins the oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier. drake honors his mentor howard brackett during his acceptance speech. not contend to stop there, the candid cameron reveals to a live, television audience that howard is gay! suspicion, paranoia, and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of green leaf, indiana. (when would a no-name high school english teacher's sexual deviance spark such massive media concern?) among those reporters lurks peter malloy (tom selleck of "high road to china"), and he wants to do a week-long exclusive one on howard. howard, however, wants nothing to do with the witch-hunting media, especially the pesky peter malloy. howard denies drake's gay charges to everybody, including his fianc√©e and his mom. malloy lingers because he smells a scoop. the revelation has turned green leaf upside down. high school principal tom halliwell (bob newhart) squirms nervously with all the media coverage. halliwell warns howard that were his marriage not imminent, he'd have to give him a pink slip. meanwhile, peter bets howard that his marriage to emily will fall through at the last moment and he'll be there to record the result on camera.howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men. he struggles to reform himself. but howard's efforts are futile. guilt swells up inside him. and then there is peter malloy, who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality. finally, at the altar in the sight of god, howard bursts. of course, bride-to-be emily montgomery is floored by howard's gay confession. predictably, the school fires howard, but he shows up for graduation. drake shows up, too, and rushes to brackett's defense. not only has the school stripped howard of his job, but they've also given his teacher-of-the-year award to somebody else. drake appeals to the principal and wins howard the unanimous support of the community.the biggest defect in rudnick's contrived script is howard himself. rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true, either by gray or straight standards. howard brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner. he helps one student gain admission to college, and he coaches the track team. how often do you hear of an english teacher doubling as a coach, too? everybody at his high school adores howard. he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. further, rudnick and oz ask us to believe that nobody else in green leaf is gay. where are howard's gay friends? are they too scared to come to his defense? no, "in & out" is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences. oz, whose screen credits include cute comedies like "dirty rotten scoundrels" and "house sitter," as well as rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope. "in & out" is not a gay recruiting movie. the filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either howard or peter malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. instead, oz and rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise: is he or isn't he gay? they flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer. finally, when howard admits that he is gay, the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative, norman rockwell-like town can accept him despite his difference.the most shocking scenes in "in & out" is probably when tabloid reporter malloy does a lip lock on howard. straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony. kline and selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a head-on collision than a closed-mouth kiss. nothing at all like the controversial 1994 british movie "priest," "in & out" emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okay-to-be-act message. if "ellen" weren't the tv equivalent, "in & out" would probably be heading toward tv as a new sitcom. watching "in & out" is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. what makes "in & out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers.

i have seen this movie many times and i never get sick of it. it is about a man coming out of the closet, that he doesn't know he is in. kevin kline's character is a teacher and when one of his former students announces kline's character is gay the people in his town start to speculate whether he is straight or gay. kline's character starts to wonder if he is straight or gay too. the acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious by all the cast. i found the movie very funny and heart-warming. i love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it. i recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time watching it.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** i loved the set-up and consistently laughed throughout the entire movie. the acting was great, with my favorite part being howard's (kevin kline) attempts to be a "manly man". the fiance and parents did a great job as a supporting cast. spoiler warning: the acting of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable. my only problem with the end was the fact that howard was actually gay. the movie is set-up as a "be who you want to be", but the movie actually does the opposite. howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves barbra streisand's movies and enjoys dancing to music. his mannerisms and tastes appear to be gay, and it isn't until it is pointed out to him that he realizes it. rather than setting howard free, it pigeon holes him. oh, he likes to dance to music, than he must be gay. his confession at the marriage felt like a bending down to society's wishes. in the end, the movie becomes a gay rights movie, which was not the original course. it almost becomes bland with the rest. i believe the movie would had been ultimately better had howard been straight. it would have been truer to the message.

i still remember watching satya for the first time. i was completely blown away. here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen. so realistic, so mumbaiyya and so believable. despite "company" (which was a very good effort) and "vaastav" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to satya.when i watched ab tak 56 for the first time, i said to myself "indian cops have their own 'satya' now". the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film. what strikes you about the "encounter" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out. there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.ab tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. with simple shots and camera angles, director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. editing seems non-existent and hence effective. the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.but for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character. sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. if i start listing my favourite dialogues, i'm afraid i'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie.the movie boasts of some stellar performances. yashpal sharma is detestable as sub-inspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak. revathi, hrishita bhatt, mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection. nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation. the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster ¬ñ oh my god! he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in him.prasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive. his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing. never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster.not that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee. nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i've ever seen in hindi cinema. from the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea ¬ñ it's almost as if nana can do no wrong. he is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching jatin about how the police force functions. his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times. his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country. it's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one.last but in no way the least, shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema. in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there, amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. i just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to bollywood-isation! if he can do that, i'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years.

it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen. although not directed by ram gopal varma, it has all the elements of an rgv film. dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). the chemistry between nana and the don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. and so are the small events like an insider not giving information to imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to nana when he is out. the change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully. the first half keeps one absolutely engrossed, moving like a documentary with nana acting like a mentor to jatin explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work.overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in indian cinema. definitely not to be missed.

one should not be too critical about the director's second feature.i really like the camera work of madiba. as mr. shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things.however, howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? remember he has not got any education of any sort. i don't think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos. worse still, madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14.any way, if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work.

this film is amazing, while not perfect by hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor, black and white that is true in many parts of the world. it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems. the children are beautiful, take special note of the young man who plays sipho. the friendships that develop are universally true, anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. the influence of adults is interesting - it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip-its of conversations and interactions-much like a child would remember experiencing. i would highly recommend this film.

i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera. i think it's a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie "city of god", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in social neighborhood are a reality. i think the films made by madiba are really beautiful. i don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films, because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius. i enjoyed very much the soundtrack. it's adjusted to the pictures.see the movie...it's good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood.

yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder. it was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising committee's favourite. which is not surprising. the subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid south africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings. i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children. a film to watch, meditate, discuss and act upon.

this was a random rental at the video store. but i was impressed from the start. wooden camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. the film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid south africa. the young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. the film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s. the musical score to the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive. after watching it the second time, i tracked down the dvd on amazon and have been happy ever since.

this was a nice film. it had a interesting storyline, that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film. the storyline kinda reminded me of the city of god. but this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison. it had what i really loved:a tinge of surrealism. some pretty interesting cinematography (thru the wooden camera) i'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely widens you're view of south africa. the actors were good (for 1st timers, most of them anyway), i especially liked estelle character, which made this movie pretty enjoyable. what is interesting though, was that it makes you ask about your own life. are you really doing what you really love? or do you consent to the norm, the conventionalism around you. definitely worth a watch.

i was looking forward to the guardian, but when i walked into the theater i wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. it's kind of like the olive garden - i like it, but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.i'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. the trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject - waterworld. plus, despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect, i'm still not completely sold on him. something about the guy just annoys me. probably has to do with his simian features.it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers' orange face lift. my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make george clooney proud? yeah, we get it. i was totally ready to hate him.but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. darn you, ape man! efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. you can quibble about its clich√©s, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. and if all that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.man, who wants all that responsibility? not me! i had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought i'd have an ashton kutcher/kevin costner movie to thank for the education? not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.the gist moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance. i saw it for free, but had i paid i would've felt i had gotten my money's worth.

i am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film. quite obviously, it is an investigation into the nature of modern love. it is suggesting that love is love while the going is good, but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first, and if the going gets tough, they get out and go onto something else.this observation has generational implications, as it is coming from generation x, makes comment on generation x, and in the end is aimed at generation x. it expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the baby boomers, the parents of generation x, had engendered in their marriages and family lives, and which gave generation x the innocent and bountiful childhood it ultimately enjoyed.the generation x attitude to love is, of course, flippant, but as decisions are made and commitments are broken, the biggest casualty are the children of generation x. this is made clear at the end of the film, and was so pungent i took a week to recover from the shock i received from this epiphany.

ok....so, by minute 15 in the film, there's still no dialogue.this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under, with sharpie encrypted info on the front. i am a programmer from a north american fest, and mod love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far-away moscow/karlovy vary interface.straight away i thought "this film is not for us" (no dialogue by minute 15??) but kept watching anyway. well, well, well. it built and built and built, and half way in i was involved in this film, because, like when you go to the zoo, at first you're reticent, but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit, you're totally 'there'.this film has a dangerousness, not at all like the much hyped wolf creek, but because it is so totally 'other' in every way shape and form, and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first-time helmers ie. - gloomy weather, red-neck intrigue, odd splicing, eerie music, and a plot which, though imperfect and basic, has a bit in common with one of the 'great aussie movies' ie the cars that ate paris, by wier. but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of ocker-ishness and playful self-deprecation that pervades many of that country's films. it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start. no cell-phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no gritty urban middle/class angst - just a dude married to a good-looker, an old volvo, and a little boy (son) who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around. oh and it's set in weird sea-side village where people all look slightly 'wrong.' photographed by nick matthews (2:37) and music by tom huzenroeder (ten canoes) mod luv succeeds where many aust. movies fail - ie it stands up without regard to the "god-forsaken" country that it comes out of. instead, it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve - and herein lies the weak link...what on earth does this film have to do with "modern love"???? the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer, or at least hints at one....and as i sat and drank a coffee and ate my hershey's afterwards, all that i could surmise was that this film's helmer, alex frayne, will prob have a lot of fun with this one./

i saw this film via one of the actors' agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth. australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.i thought the little boy in the film was excellent. mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. he was really very good. in terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, i just think this film is plain 'weird.' it's a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time. but 'good' weird as opposed to 'bad'.its hard to think of other movies like it, but its not at all like cars ate paris, maybe more like a repulsion, but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the 60's. its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it.jingo, my question is also about the title. why modern love?? anyone? also, jingo, what did you mean by "god forsaken" when you were talking about australia, hmmm? just curious

jingofighter i agree with some of your comments, but i have to disagree on a couple of things. first, this film is nothing like the cars that ate paris. not imho. nothing like it.i think the film had elements of surrealism, but i think the basic approach of the film maker is not "surrealist" per se. therefore its not really like cars paris, i think more like a weird euro work, with some scenes bearing the hallmark of "wierd" not surreal.secondly, i think the music by heuzenroeder is brilliant. they used whistling, that old sound from country and western records, and its waaayyy better than most aussie films which usually team the film maker up with a dumb sounding indy band that the company wants to push.as for the name of the film - i don't know why it's called modern love, i was kinda hoping for david bowie to appear dressed in drag and lipstick... opps i'm starting to show my age.

i saw this at the bendfilm festival friday amid an unsettled crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie. and it really threw the audience when modern love came up after a light, whimsical short (name i forget). people!!! it was really silly to mix this short with modern love - which is a serious drama movie. a film film. so the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then...modern love. hmmmm. modern love, despite my reservations (strange ending, a little too tangential)needed a short film that was commensurate with it's oddball strangeness, so my advice to the programmers for next year is to take more care planning the show.the folks watching modern love really just didn't know what had hit them, - they were led up the path and this is not their fault.modern love has some superb performances which play well against the tangential meanderings of the film - a film that its maker seems to have 'wondered out loud' rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shot.too bad the audience was misinformed. wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong approach by the well intentioned programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals.

i saw this film at the 3rd adelaide international film festival at the palace cinemas, and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes. thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c) class, in favour of er...dare i say....jolly good cinema. the producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called alex frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood. apparently he's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film, mostly in europe. the world the film creates is both brilliant and arty, not least because of strange and disconcerting editing style, the gothic characters, and the surreal sense of time and place that draws viewers into its nightmarish realm.the producer returned for the q + a after-wards. someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied "south australia." hear hear! another asked him what a 'day in the life of alex' entailed. he replied that he drives an old ute, that he has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that he's jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years! and that he plays piano which helps him to think. he doesn't drink booze and plays cricket once a week. then the q and a session ended abruptly because of the next film screening - so my thoughts are that for the next festival, they need to extend the after film sessions.

this was my first gaspar noe movie i've watched and i have to say i was shocked. i don't mind gore in generally, but this isn't even gore , it's real butchering. for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting. leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant. when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given, you can't stop and take a minute to think about it. the actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society. the movie is full of metaphors, but i'll let you figure them out. don't watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time. i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema.

this short film certainly pulls no punches. the story is of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter. the film goes onto depict how the butcher serves his time, and returns to life with his daughter in care, and having to come to terms with a life with no future.the graphic opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered, and the full frontal birth of the butchers daughter puts you a brutal frame of mind that stays with you throughout the film.the snappy flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality. consequently alot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes. you are taken in fully with the butchers non-life - particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business. his story continues in the excellent film seul contre tous

perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. the main roles seem more appropriate for clark gable and vivien leigh. i could care less about gary cooper, but ingrid bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. the movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast: flora robson is terrific as a mulatto servant. she is a white woman in blackface, and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress. jerry austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. speaking of scenes, florence bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady. i didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure hollywood dreck. it's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!

i first saw this movie when i was in elementary school, back in the 1960s. i was fascinated with the character played by ingrid bergman and it was my introduction to the french quarter of new orleans. the first part of the movie is the best as she comes back to exact some revenge on her father's wife and daughter (her mother had been driven out in disgrace). during this time she meets the wonderful clint maroon, played by gary cooper. the chemistry between the two is great. the second half of the movie takes place in saratoga, ny (the saratoga of the title) and i never enjoy it as much as the new orleans setting but it's still very good. i give this movie a ten - partly out of nostalgia but mostly because it's just a darn good movie and the characters besides those of bergman and cooper are equally wonderful (flora robson comes close to stealing the scenes from bergman). it used to be shown on tv periodically but it's shown rarely if ever - it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles.

i would rate this film high on my list of ingrid bergman films. ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is evident in scene after scene. she was sad, mean, witty,snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, tender, sorrowful, distressed, happy, etc. you name it, she was all those things and more. -and soconvincing. ingrid plays a notorious woman (clio) who comes back to neworleans and falls for a texas gambler, gary cooper (clint). i especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing, just staring at each other. she, in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboyoutfit, sitting there looking at her adoringly. what chemistry! what love!

i grew up in new york city and every afternoon abc would show the 4:30 movie- saratoga trunk was one of the first movies i remember watching as a kid. i loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years. i recently watched it again and still thought it was great - maybe i am just a romantic - but i thought it was well done. i do not want to say this movie was good only because of the main actors - i really did not know who they were when i first saw this movie - i guess i just knew quality acting as a child. both bergman and cooper were excellent. i especially loved seeing old new orleans during the time period of this movie . if you ever get a chance to visit new orleans - you should watch movies that show the city during that time period - when you get to see some of the old homes in the french quarter(not just bourbon street) or uptown, you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago. i love old movies - this one to me is a good flick!!

i have to admit i am prejudiced about my vote on this film, but i have strong reasons as i know some of the true history that was given the hollywood treatment here. edna ferber's novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can't be used. in a way, this film is all smoke & mirrors. even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after casablanca. ingrid bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette. she plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband. today that is a gold digger, but in this social era, she is desirable & the kind of woman who makes all the men want her, & all the old snooty society types talk of her & avoid her, while wishing they were her. ingrid is at her best & plays this role well. some sympathy for ingrids character is raised in the new orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave new orleans. the snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town. gary cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing texan bachelor/gambler. he pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. flora robison as ingrid's maid got nominated for an oscar as supporting actress in this film. jerry austin as cupidor was over-looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film & does it well.when the film moves to saratoga, it depicts accurately how important saratoga was in that era. i like the sequence when bergman walks to the saratoge spring to get some of the "sulfur" water which everyone considered so healthy then. when she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is & that she must have more. the real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in tunnel, new york- which is the actual saratoga trunk the film title is derived from. this battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for andrew carnagie & j. p. morgan. the line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country & the east coast. the references to it are throughout the film are very real. there is even some dialog describing carnagie as a "scot" though the reference is vague & unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle.the railroad line & the railroad tunnel in tunnel, new york (zip code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in california. the real tunnel is about 1 mile long. it is still part of a key freight line today, years after this occurred. i grew up there. gary cooper's line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right, it is still "mighty pretty country".

i gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with ingrid bergman:) lol. i really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful (even when they are awful) because she is in them. if it hadn't been her and vivien leigh (as it had originally been desired i hear) i would have given it a 9.0 simply because i love viv but probably not as much as i love ingrid. and any other actress would have made it maybe a 6. it's a good story, two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad. reminds me a little of gwtw except laced with a more highbrow attitude. gary cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film, but hey ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be.

nuri bilge ceylan's 2002 film distant (uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white the small town- kasaba), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film clouds of may (mayis sikintisi). the earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. that clouds of may succeeded on any level was a testament to ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. however, distant is ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like ingmar bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding, and he lacks bergman's penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and yasujiro ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation ceylan reconfigures). the bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal istanbul (the fact that it snows in turkey will likely surprise some), which lends the film a definite bergmanian feel, as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from krzysztof kieslowski's the decalogue. the natural images invoke the best of werner herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscapes range from the nearly precisionist compositions of michelangelo antonioni to the cultural hagiography of woody allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from manhattan, save the lack of the brooklyn bridge in the background. in another scene, ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from ozu's tokyo story. yet, like all great artists, ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's needs¬Ö. distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them, but it does not describe the film itself, for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the istanbul airport, and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. as he watches her, from a distance, we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. will she leave her husband and return to mahmut? not in this film. he pulls back behind a column, and nazan merely turns her head back to her future. mahmut is her past, and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. mahmut will never get it. most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. that some viewers will get the film, and that ceylan gets his own powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. distant does, albeit it at just the right length.

√Ω th√Ωnk uzak √Ωs the one of the best films of all times and everybody must realize this movie.i m a turkish boy and a big cinema fun. and in this days our cinema industry is highing up.and uzak is the best turkish film of last ten years.and maybe one of the best films of all times.director nuri bilge ceylan is quite amazing.telling story,characters,atmosphere is wonderful.he is a minimalist director and tells about routine event family,dreams,expects,life.tells about you ,tells about me,tells about us.i promise you will find a piece of your body in this movie.cinema life welcomes a new director.he is waiting to realize.i promise yo you will love this movie please watch it

a study of one of those universally familiar, physical and/or emotional states: isolation. i think the film also comments on cultural displacement too.the film presents the experiences of two turkish men (cousins). one has money (and the comforts that come of having 'made-it' with a steady income); the other has none and goes in search of work. neither are happy. expect no celebration of life here - this is loneliness, warts and all.the film succeeds in offering a powerfully bleak traverse across the 'low lands' of the human condition. brave film-making. well-acted and well-shot in my view (outdoor shots by the harbour being my own favourites). a film that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfilment in life (not to mention employment); everyone else will find a companion in this film. a film with all the warmth and pace of an ice-floe. expect a bitter pill, not a 'happy pill.'

the only complaint i heard about this film was that it was slow. though, perhaps this is the point. the two characters clash unforgivingly and the slow build-up of tension between them is anxiety-producing. the intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience. istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, scenery captivating, and the plot is thrilling - not in that "look, the hero blew up yet another car and he's now flying with his motorcycle" kind of way, though. i had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog engulf istanbul.

perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself. what i want to point out here is that "distant" is not only an art-house film but one of the best art-house films. from all the art-house films i have seen, "distant" is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold. it is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovsky's nostalgia. one commentator got it right, that sex, a jaded, common feature among foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "distant" and in a good way. what is most remarkable about "distant" is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world. fortunately "distant" doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings.

this is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant turkish director, nuri bilge ceylan, whose last film mayis sikintisi -which was very cehovian- was shown in prestigious film festivals. differing from his previous films, the story of 'uzak' is set on istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world. however, in ceylan's film, we do see only minor traces of that huge crowd. rather he choose to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships. the photographer, who -we understand that- has also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited the customs of the city life, not only in material sense. in his relation to his relative, we see him first as caring and tolerant, however, when he could not find a job, our suburbian character starts to be disturbed for sharing his private 'space' with someone whose leaving date becomes ambiguous. i will not reveal the tactics he develops in order to pull his relative out of his life to prevent any harm on your viewing pleasure, but it is enough to say that ceylan shows us the tactics that we acquire within the routine of suburbian life; 'tactics' to keep our own private space, 'tactics' in order not to communicate with other people, 'tactics' to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature (since our own experience, we believe that, is complex enough).ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the borders of modern (or postmodern ?) city by depicting the two characters in different manners. but, he doesn't condemn any of the two characters for doing this, rather he uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference. for example, in search of new opportunities, we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces. even within the house, he prefers balcony as his favourite space. on the other hand, we see the photographer always within the closed spaces, and generally at his home. although there are more than 10 million people out there, and lots of adventures, lots of interesting things to discover (or are there any?) he prefers sitting at home, watching tv, etc. his home is like his temple, a kind of sacred place.everyone living in a big city, and conscious of the experience he is living through, will find something belonging to himself in uzak. if you like this film, i am sure that you will like ceylan's other two films, mayis sikintisi (the clouds of may) and kasaba (the town). go and find them!.

this is not a film to impress you with high budget, high-tech shots, fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director. but it's a film by a director who is also a very good photographer, who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human, not as an half-god unlike most of the directors. this is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best 'performances' with unreal or, at best, learned gestures and mimics. rather, it's a film in which they act as real as it can be. actually, they are not professional actors at all. the dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life. you tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words. you show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest. this is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life. and this is your chance to see yourself from outside, impersonated by the main characters. i saw all of the films of nuri bilge ceylan, incl. his short film koza (cacoon) thanks to those who puts it in the dvd. many would compare him with tarkovsky, ozu and maybe bresson or bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur. and he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life. that is the kind of sincerity you'll find in uzak.

like all good art, this movie could mean different things to different people. to me it means that failing to open your hart to the others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty live. the convenience of the selfishness is like the junk food: it feels good, but eventually could make you sick.almost everything i see in the us is a commercial mass production of action garbage, shallow dramas, and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic movie really touched me. thank you, nuri bilge ceylan (and all the other in the cast)!ivan yanachkov

following the collapse of yesilcam (turkey's answer to hollywood) in the mid '90s few but the most prescient of observers could have foreseen such a recent pique in the turkish film industry, arguably built upon the work of ex-photographer nuri bilge ceylan.uzak is the director's third feature and forms something of a trilogy with his two earlier pictures (kasaba and clouds of may), following similar themes and techniques. the film finds mahmoud, a commercial photographer, living alone in a small istanbul apartment only visited occasionally by his brusque, married lover. yusuf, his nephew, has left his village home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. the younger man stays with mahmoud while fruitlessly looking for work in the city, drinking in caf√©s and nervously observing young women he never approaches.the film's title is translated as "distant", and the film beautifully illustrates every possible connotation of the word; yusuf's physical distance from his home, mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him and the generational distance between the two men.ceylan's films rarely contain heightened dramatics, instead allowing full and rich characters to develop from within the tightly framed, static shots. he acts as director, producer, writer, cinematographer and co-editor and casts friends and family in many of the roles. such a confined, insulated approach to film-making might be expected to lead to films hard to infiltrate and connect with for most viewers, making uzak's undoubted humanity all the more impressive.ceylan is, however, a better cinematic formalist than dramatist, taking the reigns from such past masters of cinematic language as ozu and tarkovsky. after viewing uzak, i can think of few better suited to the task.

the first time i saw the poster, i was stunned by its tranquility and beauty. then the city of istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since.not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture. it itself is a landscape.actually there are a lot of things going on in the film, but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination, thus creating a really flat life. **(mild spoiler)one can see mahmut's ladylove crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight; one can see mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness. the most dramatic scene in the film to me is yusuf laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece,** and that's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring, lonely life bursting out in such a way.with all the trivialities in life weeded, the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets...and as the story unfolded, i sort of finally grasped their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things intervened, which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost, especially for an irresponsible artist like mahmut.i've just finished my second watching. last night, i crouched into my quilt, had some vodka beside my bed and went through the whole film in a trance. i felt two real lives going on, one outside the screen, one inside the screen. i felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety 'cause the people inside were experiencing it. i just had myself removed from all those things.we cannot deny the universal problem of communication, and loneliness even puts us far towards it, and it becomes a vicious spiral. i bet mahmut still didn't figure out a way of living in the end. that's why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world, the coldness and landscape.

after some further thought about this film, i find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the boy's dream. i have actually received some spiritual strength from northfork.......angels do exist....we definitely are entertained by angels....most of the time we aren't even aware of it..... at a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life, i personally really needed this film. yes, as i wrote before, it speaks to so many......can't wait to get to heaven..."being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff, i found this film to be genuine cinema. all i can say is it touched me in so many ways, that i still am sorting it all out. north fork is a wonderful film. one that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart. the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me. pay attention, as you'll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story. i think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some, but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly. i want to view it several more times, just so i can take it all in!the industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist.my thanks to all involved in the making of this film."

i recently attended sundance as i have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little indies, the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. but then i saw mark and michael polish's 'northfork' and i remembered why i so fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'northfork' sweeps across the screen with visionary daring and harkens back to the seminal early work of terence malick and the existential landscapes of antonioni. it's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths. suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning. it reawakened my imagination and cast an imposing shadow over all the other films i saw this year. it is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most american movies. i plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. for it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery, a haunting work where one can roam the plains of montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. the cast performs this luminiscent piece with striking conviction particularly james woods and nick nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers. maybe 'northfork' will help us find a new wave of american cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception. see it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred by seeing 'northfork' will awaken memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of the polish brothers.

at first glance a film like northfork, a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could be just an ordinary film. as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child, a greedy land owner, we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest. however, when one is first introduced to this film, you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing. it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction, that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique.at first glance things are not as clear, but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning, and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing. it's what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film, or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen.the films deep spiritual and dream like qualities, give it a slow and methodical approach which i am sure will bore some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture, the film is great to witness.rating 8 out of 10

imagery controls this film. the characters, although interesting, ultimately take a back seat. the first scene i remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean, that then opens to full screen and color. the bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. the theme of the movie here, being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living.water as an ultimate consciousness, as a tool of god, is used to here to force people to get their "houses" in order (judgment day). the dead have to be accounted for and lifted to a better place. whatever one has left unresolved or unsettled, will be washed away. there's no clinging on to the past, to a buried memory of what was.this movie has been compared to o, brother where art thou, and the threat of water and its use as a cleansing force is similar to that film. what's different in this movie is that the coming of the water is knowable and so, again, the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now.i agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a david lynch work. take, for example, the dinner segment with the deep-voiced and androgynous waitress. one gets the same surreal feel from the setting and odd character as one does with the backwards talker in the scene from fire starter. the difference is that lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a troubled character, whereas this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. the men in black suits can't have anything they want-they must be patient and accept what is available.

it is a rare and fine spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither preachy nor mawkish. a work of mature and courageous insight, northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind. unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison, wim wenders' 1987 wings of desire (der himmel √ºber berlin), it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural. this story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the american west withholds the fairytale literalness that marked its german predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with obsequious sentimentalism. its celestial transcendence, be it inspired by doleful faith or impelled by a fever dream, never parts ways with crud and rot. this firm grounding redounds to great credit for writers and directors mark and michael polish.

one of the great tragedies of life is that disney is so very successful at everything that they do. if they were not, we might have more unique little gems of animation such as "the curious adventures of mr. wonderbird." the story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called up-and-down-land (i could have the name wrong). he is hated by everyone. his favorite hobby is shooting birds, and at some point in the past, he presumably killed the wife of mr. wonderbird (a bird, played with typical flair by peter ustinov) leaving him with four young chicks to raise. meanwhile, we see that another of the evil king's hobbies is painting. he has done three paintings in particular: a self portrait, a painting of a shepherdess (which he has fallen in love with), and a painting of chimney sweep (of whom he is jealous). one night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep climb down out of their paintings and run away together. the self portrait of the king climbs down out of his frame as well, and does away with the real king (you think i'm making this up? its the real plot) and sends the royal police force after the young lovers. mr. wonderbird then assists the lovers in attempting to escape the king's forces.the plot is wonderfully surreal, and the setting up-and-down-land is an incredibly imagined place, full of towering buildings accessible only by elevators. its an equal mixture of the worlds of "metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of dr. seuss.watch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most animated features.

wonderbird, certainly an unbelievably refined cartoon, drawn in a deliciously old¬ófashioned way, and sensationally old¬ófashioned in almost any respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and heinous monarch; accordingly, the kingdom, or at least what we see¬óthe surroundings of the king's palace, seems devoid, uninhabited.a few inhabitants there are¬óaway from the sun¬óin the withered underground city.an advice¬ócall it an allegory, call it a parable, only do not call it a fable.because imdb encourages prolixity, and maybe for other reasons as well, i will add that this cartoon is the work of the great paul grimault.

(review is of the original 1950's version not the restored 1980's one) in a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run off. a portrait of the king, who loves the shepherdess, kills the real king and takes his place. a huge bird, the wonderbird of the title, acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers.this is a strange strange movie... no surreal, very very very surreal.the style of the background is very european while the characters are fliescher meet warner but early arty warner of the non major characters. they move in both realistic and cartoon like manners.this is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but peter ustinov as the bird is a riot, his kids and the puppy are wonderful. there are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile.and there is deep philosophy in the film, about the existence of a world out there...out beyond a metropolis subterranean city.this is a really neat movie. there is something just so odd and unique about it that rewards you if you stay with it for the whole ride. its not perfect but what the hell.this is a movie to search out. if your local bargain dvd bin has the capcom version (paired with alice in paris) buy it. it should run you under ten bucks, probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons, two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things.

heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks. i wasn't expecting much but wow, was i ever surprised. it's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ico for ps2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo.sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane! it's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952. also, the king was probably one of the creepiest character's i've seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, weird eyes (usually crossed), and a soft but scary voice. the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr. wonderbird (a large talking green bird)to save them. the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked. it's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times, it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film. check it out sometime.

i just want to comment to the woman above, that the movie does credit beethoven in the begging. in the beginning credits they show it. thank you. i think this is an amazing movie. they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is wonderful, and they picked the voices for the characters very well. it teaches children to never give up, and to always have hope. princess annika doesn't give up , and it shows children that they can do the same. the movie also has humor in in for all ages, parents and children, to laugh at. the colors in this movie are great, and kids can really feel good while they are watching it. i watched this movie for the first time, now i am a huge fan, and i'm sure your child will be too. walmart sells tons of barbie and the magic of pegasus stuff, so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren't watching it. thank you!

for a kid's movie, this is great. as an adult and mother, i enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. there is a lot going on in this movie. the following *might* be considered a *spoiler*... barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie. she also learns not to give up hope and to master her anger. i loved the sense of teamwork you get from watching barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. there's nothing in the movie i found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. in fact, i felt that the moral messages of the movie were superb and well done.the animation was pretty good. i really enjoy the ice-skating scenes and think that they were very well done. there's a lot of action in this film, so i suspect that most kids would enjoy it... not just the ones that are really into barbie. my daughter actually picked it out because of the pegasus. she loves horses. but she enjoyed the movie very much. my daughter is autistic, and was able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it. she really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved.one thing that i was thinking about was that many people object to barbie (and ken) because they are so beautiful. yet, i think that kids, just like adults like to look at beautiful people and things. it's natural. as adults, we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars too. it's wonderful though, that the barbie character and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. while it's fun to watch pretty people, it grows old if there is no substance behind the pretty face.overall, i'd say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it, too. :)

for once a barbie movie that is good. i'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but i'm hooked on these movies. i hated barbie when i was younger but the movies i love. shiver is so cute and i've fallen in love with him. he's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with aiden. oh man i'm in love with shiver. i love annika determination not to give up on hope and eventfully it works. i love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones. barbie & swan lake is other brilliant movie. i would recommend this movie to children of all ages (even boys) because the movie is that good and i'm hard to please. barbie and the magic of pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting.

i would have to say that in general barbie movies have impressed me. i have a 5 year old barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say i have seen quite a lot of barbie these holidays, but i am not sick of them.this film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of barbie's hair in this film. it has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and i think that this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. this film is well worth ago, especially if you have young relievers. they will be entertained for hours!

my 5 year old daughter is very into the barbie series of movies. i've had mixed feelings about that - not wanting her to buy into the whole barbie-doll image of things, and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for mattel. this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her, and - it being a lazy saturday morning and with not much else to do - i agreed. i don't know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls, which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what i've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies (or, more likely, a bit of both) but whichever is the case, i have to admit - somewhat to my surprise, this wasn't half bad.it's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) essentially, annika ("played" by barbie) has to find a way to build a "wand of light" to reverse the evil spells of the wizard wenlock, who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone. the animation here was pretty good - not disney-calibre (if one thinks of disney as the standard to aspire to) but generally pretty good, and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middle-aged men, i still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out. it's true that there were some holes in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again one must remember the target audience, who wouldn't really think of such things. this is an all around decent family movie. 7/10

normally i try to avoid barbie films, but this one was unmistakably awesome. kudos to the graphics and character voice overs. it all flowed well. this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others, but is well worth buying! i don't have kids, but the kids i babysit, (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd. i honestly don't know why this is rated so low, but for kids, especially your barbie lovin' 8 year old will love this. its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are. this "childrens" film has excellent morals and shows teamwork. it has no swearing, bits of romance (if your old enough to figure it out) and beautifully written storyline. thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten!

after all these years, i am puzzled as to why julie brown (west coast) isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star. she is one of the funniest females on the planet. in this spoof, she takes on madonna who is one of her favorite targets. she is medusa, a hugely successful singer, like madonna who also happened to have documentary "truth or dare." julie brown spoofs madonna as medusa who came from wisconsin, the land of dairy and beer. i remember the segment where she went to wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. i don't remember if it was a parent or her pet. i remember somebody saying that medusa did nothing original. she was just copying others. i have to say that i hope this spoof documentary is available on dvd somewhere. julie brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others.

this parody is cleverly done: from the songs (express yourself becomes expose yourself, like a prayer is now party in my pants and vogue is now vague) to the fake interviews of the cast of the show, this movie is hilarious. remember madonna saying she didn't know about the rain season in asia? in this one, she doesn't know about the volcano season. it is a precious jewel. they got a lot of money on that spoof, and it pays off. highly recommended!!!

this is one of julie's greatest tributes to music, alongside her "trapped in the body of a white girl" album. to quote the great medusa "dare to go bare, just wear your underwear, you'll get a ride home everytime" - wow!!! now that is some good advice. "you can dance, at my party! yeah, justify your dance shoes!.....you're invited to the party in my pants. yeah come on boy let's dance, at the party in my pants" julie brown is hilarious!!! it is almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is awesome!!!

i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. since i am part of a sorority i didn't want them to make greek organizations look bad....but i think greek is hilarious. yes, they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor.all the characters are pretty likable minus rebecca logan (i just can't stand her), casey and rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. then there is cappie. who doesn't love a guy like cappie haha his character brings so much to the show. rusty's room mate, dale played by clark duke, is hilarious as well.it's definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2. i can't wait till it is back on!!

"medusa: dare to be truthful" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, "madonna: truth or dare". julie brown's brilliant creation skewers madonna's highly entertaining documentary (although it wasn't exactly daring, insightful, candid, or truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. i highly recommend this for madonna fans, julie brown fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.

julie brown hilariously demolishes madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival madonna's own. cinematography and sets are top notch.kathy griffin and chris elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film. appearances by bobcat goldthwait and wink martindale, as themselves, is an added bonus.it's hard to tell if brown's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease madonna, though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it.my favorite line: "why don't you come here (to the phillipines); all they eat is dog and i'm a vegetarian."

this movie was a riot, it pokes fun of "madonna - truth or dare" in all the right places. i love madonna & i love julie brown. how could i ask for more..julie's spoof of "vogue", entitled "vague" was hysterical.. "kelly lebrock thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paper plate". "brooke shields, dawber, pam personality of spam"!! i could've died! and just wait till you see what she can do with a watermelon!!

i really liked this movie. i watched it last night on the public broadcasting system. the part i liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past. they basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. i think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time. it did show the fact that england, or any other country, isn't prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed. i have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so i can't really say if they are normally their parts. after the movie, they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the u.s. it was a thought-provoking discussion!

before seeing this picture i was quite skeptic, i don't like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer. i was also afraid this would be like the 2-part mini-series "10.4" which had a far-fetched concept, little relation to the real world and very poor execution. at the beginning is says: "this film is fiction, but the events portrayed and the information about uk emergency planning are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea, but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness. the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start: it is coming and we're not prepared. the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen - there are plans for when it does - all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have, on even the most cynical of viewers. the movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart-breaking personal moments, which won't convey the message, so none of the romeo-juliet drama we're used to.

seeing this film brought back to me memories of 9/11. the first thing i remember of that morning was seeing tv pictures of an airplane flying into a large building, and my immediate thoughts "must be a preview for a new tom clancy film".this was not a tom clancy film. this was certainly not a british version of "the sum of all fears". the typical tom clancy film or novel has a relatively small cast, a linear plot, and usually some sort of resolution. this film had neither. sure, what i saw directly on screen was a small cast, a plot, and a vague resolution, but, like 9/11, the point was that reality was so much larger and more complex.i work in systems planning, and the reality of the disaster preparation exercise, and the disaster itself, is painfully obvious. it's impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor will it be any more possible to deal with this when it happens.from the argument between the police (not enough is being done to prepare) and the politicians (giving everybody on the tube a gasmask would cause panic), to the constant loudspeaker announcements (you are in no danger to your health, but don't go home before we decontaminate you), and (don't eat, drink, or smoke before we decontaminate you), i was on edge during the entire film. not the slightest urge to channel surf.this film was 90 minutes in length. it could have been twice that, and still not shown all the possible details. instead, it left enough unsaid to allow each of us to imagine the details, each of us in our own way. that made it so much more real to me, than any tom clancy film.i lived in london once, and just off the edgeware road. and i took the train from waterloo station many times. as i watched dirty war, i kept telling myself that this is only fiction. right now.allah and jehovah willing, this film will remain fiction, and sometime in 20 or 30 years, my nephews may watch this film and remember the early 21st century, and the panic we felt too much. hopefully to the same degree as i feel currently, when viewing memorabilia of the cold war with the evil communist regime of the mid-20th century, and remember "drop and cover" exercises in school.

dirty war is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written t.v. drama's in the 25 years.the acting is superb, the writing is spectacular.diry war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological, and radiological terrorist attack here on american soil.dirty war should be made into a major motion picture - it's that good! i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth.this t.v. drama reveals how british intelligence (mi5 & mi6) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of england's involvement in the iraq war.the scenes of different parts of london, england are also spectacular.dirty war is a must see!!!

the film is partly a thriller and partly a public-service announcement when seeing the events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and of course victims. in this smart drama lessons are given about contamination and surviving chaos while meantime the backstage look at the way crisis is managed prompts viewers to distrust guardians and to be scared by assailants. the film, originally aired on bbc, gets to arouse effectively doubts on official prepareparedness. performances are proper, understated though never terrific. the flick is just a beginning, a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it gets to work in my opinion, giving the right thrills and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself questions.

this movie was really interesting... it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premiered.it was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are - you aren't. if this was made for an american audience - it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the bbc did! it still is propaganda, in some extend - no film today with these themes can not be - but it dealt with the issue successfully.a film that should be shown in all terrorism/counter-terrorism courses but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged! a great film in which the bbc took a few risks and unfortunately, london does not need a fictional tale any more, due to the reality of july 7 2005.

i lived in london most of my adult life before i moved stateside so missed this film when it came out and only saw this now on hbo. i disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a hollywood production, the uk team gave it a chilling and foreboding atmosphere from day one and i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what was going to happen to my home city. and of course,nine months after the film comes out 7/7 happens. yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. having lived in both countries, it is also clear the likelihood of this happening in the uk is much greater than in the us, muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the uk, in the us they assimilate much more readily.

i'm not a big tv person... but when i saw the premier episode of greek, i couldn't wait until next week! i don't miss the show for nothing!thank god for dvr! lol i'm in love with cappie... he acts like a bad boy, but he is so sweet... everybody has their own character so, we have pretty much all types of people. you could still throw in a hispanic and a chubby persons.i didn't go to school in usa, so, i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that, so, when my husband told me about the show i didn't pay attention, until he asked me to watch it and since i didn't have noting better to do, i agreed. i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching it.so.. i'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on! i will hope for a second, third and who knows how many more episodes! its a really good show, very funny and entertaining!

i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. i remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on abc family.never doubt an abc family show! this show surprised me in the best way possible. not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny, and enjoyable. i was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like "this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid... etc." but this show is anything but! the characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all. there is a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening right before your eyes.don't doubt this show, it is truly enjoyable to watch... and get hooked on ;)

so when i first saw commercials for greek i did have a few questions to how they were going to approach greek life, if they were going to give away sacred frat and sorority secrets, if they were going to focus on the brother and sisterhood a fraternity or sorority brings, or what most college kids think of greek life as a huge party.luckily, it covered everything. the story plot was great, it gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be like, someone you don't want to be like, and of course a crazy roommate!it was one of my first looks at what writers believed greek life to be like, and i can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead on.i love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between rusty and his crazy roommate. its hard enough moving away from home, and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, then come to find out.. you have nothing in common. probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmare.rustys sister casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus everyone is jealous of. what didn't she have? oh thats right.. evan all to herself. rebecca and evan had an "affair" early into the season, which made you feel fairly sympathetic for casey. her character evolved, and her relationship with rusty became more and more loving and outgoing. cappie is one of the most fun loving characters, and absolutely insane. one of my favorite episodes included him getting completely trashed at a strip club, and rusty having to call casey to bail them out. i like how they addressed the issue of gay people in greek houses, calvin was a very real feeling character, and i really respected him because he stuck to his standards. so jen k was fairly crazy, but she actually liked rusty. it was surprising and i continued to question her from the start, but of course, i did want it to work out between her and rusty.i am definitely looking forward to the return of greek. it takes you into the truth of greek life, something that a lot of people look past. one of the biggest things that frats and sororities are known for is parties and drinking. greek is a great show, and the characters are easy to relate to.

i really like the show!! as a part of greek life, i can say that some things are over-exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny.rusty is a likable lead character, his roommate is hilarious and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights. i like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations.this show covers it all, and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad (how else could it be on abc family?).my favorites are cappie (of course), rusty's roommate and pretty much all of kappa tau. this show is a great launch pad for them and i'm excited to see what doors this opens. please renew this show next summer, abc family. like i said, love love love it!!

when i first heard about "greek," i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. another of abc family's so-bad-they're-almost-good shows. but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.as a member of a greek society, i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. and are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a tv screen. the opening scene harkened to an only-slightly-dramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there.this isn't a show for over-sensitive greeks. if you get offended even at jokes about things that aren't-so-great about greek life, then you'll spend the entire first episode, and probably many other, cringing and yelling. but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it. it's nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing ever is.

i saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and i didn't know where it had come from, and i looked for about six years to find it, and i finally found it here at imdb.com! just the whole concept of the movie is great, i believe it's got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings, keeping tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity. and the way that he does it,to keep himself from being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining. i don't remember exactly how it ended, but i remember, it finished with a great climax, and a good twist.

ten years before "the matrix" and hot on the heals of "they live" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. if you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, david lynch meets john carpenter style movie-making you'll love "split". there are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. the plot involves a man named starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream. similar to "they live", "1984" and "the matrix", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy big brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city. this is all revealed pretty early on in the plot. possible spoiler: starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality. along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. i challenge anyone to not be rewinding, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.

this is a absolutely masterful stroke of genius by paul thomas anderson the writer/director of this movie. it really examines the pluses and minuses of the world of porn and consequences for your actions living in a world literally fueled by sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. only of the finest casts assembled with mark wahlberg, burt reynolds, heather graham, julianne moore, william h. macy, philip seymour hoffman, don cheadle, philip baker hall, and others.

"boogie nights" is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director. this film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances. though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people. this movie has an unexpected emotional impact also, you will remember it long after it is over.

what a movie! it has undeniably entertaining subject matter (unless you're a prude) and a mature, funny, and complex script from paul thomas anderson (magnolia, hard eight). pt anderson will undoubtably be around for some time. the evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece. every character is expertly played and touching and fully-shaped. from burt reynolds as jack horner (the director) to julianne moore (his movie-star) and mark whalberg (as dirk diggler) they all are fabulous. and the story? wow! honest look at business and failure and consequences and family. one of the best movies of all time! i give it a >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>a+

sometimes the academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films, or doesn't nominate them because they are controversial or strong. sometimes they are nominated, but don't win anything (i hope this doesn't happen this year with "american beauty"). this is exactly what happened with "boogie nights", which was the best film of 1997. the academy preferred to give the best picture oscar to "titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards to the overrated "good will hunting" and the irritating "full monty". the other pictures which were nominated in the main category were "l.a. confidential" and "as good as it gets", great movies, but "boogie nights" is still better and should have been remembered in more categories.this amazing film tells the story of eddie adams (mark wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17 year old barman who takes the attention of jack horner (burt reynolds, in a redeeming acting), a director of porn films. eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies. he changes his name for dirk diggler and starts to make a huge success. but fame... doesn't last forever. other characters also have their parallel stories- amber waves (julianne moore, perfect), buck (don cheadle) and others, including rollergirl (heather graham), an actress who accepts to do anything, but she has to be wearing her roller shoes.what could have been a banal, trivial film, turns into a perfect, memorable one in the hands of paul thomas anderson. what makes "boogie nights" such a great film is its execution, added to a clever, well written screenplay, great soundtrack, etc. each character is very well developed, and each of them has his/her importance in the context. each feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern american cinema."boogie nights" is a strong, impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema. under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of highs and downs, things that we face in our lives. it is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s, exactly an age of highs and downs. that's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. 10/10

the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds, mark wahlberg, and julianne moore. these three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. the film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise. on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, i think there was some overkill in this department. paul thomas anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work "the dirk diggler story." one thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. the wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. there are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.the story is about a gifted young man named eddie adams (wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. he changes his name to dirk diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. jack horner (reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. however dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. although a greater focus is placed on the character dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. you will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. all-in-all a well done film.

this is a classic that will be able to hold up with drama's to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70's style and it's a story about the 70's. it is funny, action-filled, entertaining and sad at the same time. it has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions. 4 stars!

some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it, it seemed like a good movie. so i'm in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvd's and i decide what the hell. so i rent it. after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it was.this movie just touched my heart. everything in it was so amazing. the stories, the actors, the dark humor, the music!!! oh don't get me started on the music in this film. pt andderson is one of the greats. definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantino(a god.)after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with anderson's commentary (i was suprised on how such a cool guy he is.)anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie, if they haven't already. anderson is obviously a film lover. in the movie he rips off so many other directors tecniques. such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. obviously ripped off from "i am cuba." but i have no beef what so ever with that. the film is very respectable with it's ripoff's.i recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film(porn.)10/10

sometime ago i watched a video of paul thomas anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape. paul thomas anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by burt reynolds. his name is jack horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with the beauty¬Ö and with the "big cocks and tits". soon as he meets eddie adams (mark walhberg), he believes that he has found the new star for his films. and that's how the story of the young eddie in the porn industry begins.the film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. but soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party, the story of the new eddie begins, the story of dirk diggler. all of them will taste the real success with dirk as the main star, winning lots of prizes and helping jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about brock landers, the new character of dirk. this sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for jack are his firsts "real" films. but here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible 80's" when there is going to be $ex, drugs and rock & roll for dirk and pals. but we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses. in dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for dirk and his friends. that sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of alfred molina, which ends in a total mess. is funny for us and a terrible experience for dirk and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when dirk is back, brock is back.well i haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but i must say that all are amazingly well developed. the cast is just superb with the best performance that i have seen of mark walhberg. julianne moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character; reilly, macy, hoffman, heather graham, guzman, etc are just memorable, all of their characters with funny and sad moments.finally, i really love the amazing cinematic style of anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. i used to say that "magnolia" was my favourite of anderson but right now, after watching all except "sidney", i can't say that i have a favourite because i love them all!ps: somewhere i read that this film is the "scorsese film" of anderson so i'm more than sure that if you love "goodfellas" and "casino" you will love this one too. i f*cking love "boogie nights"!

this picture's following will only grow as time goes by. better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings. i've seen it three times now so i know. anderson was compared to some of the great american directors (altman, scorcese, tarantino) and he may have those influences but chances are, after a few more films, he'll be considered part of that short list himself.one last note: julianne moore's "amber waves" will resonate in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded. the best performance of the year -in any of the four categories.

altman and scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest american films of the past 20 years. boogie nights didn't make a huge initial splash, and i still don't think it's received the credit it deserves. the immediate clamor surrounding the film ("some porn movie with marky mark") was wholly without merit. what paul thomas anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the american dream (if such a thing still exists).for those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, boogie nights tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young eddie adams (wahlberg). eddie is just a dopey kid from torrance, california who wants something more out of life. his room is soaked in muscle-bound, naive americana. his dreams are far bigger than his potential, but not quite as large as his...special gift. his bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, omni-present adult film industry. jack horner (burt reynolds as the film's twinkle-eyed papa bear) gets wind of eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.before you can say "deep-throat," eddie has changed his name to dirk diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. fame and fortune make dirk's acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs. his friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but it soon proves to be a sunday picnic like no other. as the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, dirk & co. begin a dangerous backslide. anderson put everything he had into this glorious, moving epic. it sizzles and never fizzles. nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after elo fades from the soundtrack. see this one immediately. and then watch it again.and again.

if you listen to ween (the pod, god/satan), then you know what's going on with "split" i found that watching the film under the influence of lsd helped to deal with audio/video tracers from fantastic editing job. the plot was only important from second to second. the acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. don't bother writing about something out of your comprehension's reach...there just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw , amateur level. i dare anyone to make a movie that can equally mess with my head and change the way i look at visual arts and the world's reality. not to mention the many realities that haven't yet been explored by this humans mind. i love the vision of chris shaw. i also appreciate the texturing terroristic film "the begotten" by e. elias merhige.

a small town kid working in a big city becomes a huge star and then spirals out of control. it shows you the rise to fame and then fall from fame and back to a little rise. great cast of actors, and a great director = a great, great movie called boogie nights.p.t anderson. an amazing director who made boogie nights amazing. from the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends you can feel how beautiful this movie is. some scenes are breathtaking, literally. a great story, a great movie. mark whalberg was fantastic, philip seymour hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything. thomas jane also was magnificent and although he only had a small part he played it to perfection. there is one scene in this movie i can't get over, "the drug deal gone bad scene" it was amazing, music acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing. i hadn't seen boogie nights and thank god i did, its so well rounded and i am now a huge fan of pta (paul thomas anderson).do whatever you have to do and watch this movie.

boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997. i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it. i'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance/disaster epic titanic again. the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow-minded the academy is. only atom egoyan's the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckis's contact came close to being as great as boogie nights. no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantino's pulp fiction -- until now. paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. just as tarantino gave john travolta's career a kick, p.t. anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs. boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle, heather graham, and john reilly. overall, a wonderful film. the best since pulp fiction. maybe even better.

'boogie nights' uses its protagonist, dirk diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in america's shameful past, which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography, therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth. its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors, involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in hollywood, and all-too-often exploited by the press. it seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an e! true hollywood story special. drugs, sex and violence -- the american dream. but what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls.dirk diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset on his body. dirk's real name is eddie adams, a californian who dreams of becoming a star. he believes that god gives one great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is a rather unusual one. after falling out with his mother, eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy jack horner (burt reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the leading "actor" in most of horner's films. with newfound success, eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself, and so dirk diggler is born.eddie/dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star john holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'wonderland', which starred val kilmer. 'boogie nights' is unarguably the better of the two, proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience: regular cinema-goers.the film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography -- filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of x-rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere. in a way, the film's director -- paul thomas anderson -- implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in american history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic. anderson's style is so deep, and so distinct, that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first-hand. not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film.all was not happy on the set of 'boogie nights'. prior to filming, anderson approached reynolds repeatedly, asking him many separate times to play the role of horner. eventually, reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career, publicly disowning it, before being nominated for a best supporting actor academy award and suddenly shutting up. a year before, anderson had suffered title disputes over sydney/hard eight. he preferred the latter title for his film, and new line cinema thought the former was more marketable. he essentially lost the battle, and anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his movie through the mouth of a character.the casting of the film is one of its finest aspects. the paul thomas anderson regulars are here, as well as a whole top-notch cast of first-timers. to name some of the more well-known stars: john c. reilly, phillip seymour hoffman, luis guzman, william h. macy, heather graham and julianne moore. but the entire movie essentially borders down to mark wahlberg, as eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary traits to portray such a character. this is his best role to date.anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene. when jack horner first meets eddie, anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be. the opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot that follows jack and amber into a night club, where most of the characters are first introduced. it reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in robert altman's 'the player' -- it works so brilliantly in boogie nights, and is the first indication that anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. his style is fast-paced in the vein of martin scorsese, where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed. incidentally, anderson references two classic scorsese shots -- the closing de niro mirror speech from 'raging bull' and the tracking nightclub scene from 'goodfellas'. anderson is a young, growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction, despite his age. whereas his first feature film, 'hard eight', was noticeably wise and poignant, 'boogie nights' is even more so.'boogie nights' began as an effort of love on paul thomas anderson's account. having filmed the extraordinary hard eight in 1996, anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine. boogie nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content, occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography, only it is far more sophisticated than such trash. it is a blazing, wonderful modern-day masterpiece that is as mind-numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish. arguably anderson's best film and among the greatest -- and most important -- projects of the last decade.

everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in paul thomas anderson's boogie nights. although the film is completely fictional, it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin john holmes.in southern california in 1977, eddie adams (mark wahlberg) is working as a busboy in a nightclub. one of the regular customers is pornographer jack horner (burt reynolds) and two of his starlets, amber waves (julianne moore) and rollergirl (heather graham). jack and eddie meet and jack realizes that eddie is well...a little...gifted.so eddie stars in jack's films under the pseudonym of "dirk diggler." he becomes a "big" porno star (no pun intended) and seems to be on top of everything. then comes the 80s when video replaces film and jack's porno empire begins to collapse, along with dirk diggler and everybody else working in the field.boogie nights is a really well-filmed drama. there is a little bit of violence, but p.t. anderson makes it more stylized. and it kind of is a scathing approach to the degradations of pornography, especially when vhs became the standard medium for making pornos.a lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced. william h. macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films, whose wife keeps having sex with everybody. i especially liked don cheadle's role as buck the stereo salesman. the best performance is boogie nights was definitely burt reynolds. a 90s classic!

what has to change in today's attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach. the approach is awful! comparing it to pulp fiction, seeing only the pornography, and all its aspects.. come on people, there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture. and to all the sceptics, hasn't paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again? magnolia is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this "industry" that film-making is today.. and what about there will be blood? that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not! yeah, you! the so-called consumer.. you know something: f#*k you! you don't deserve this, you don't deserve anything. so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films, even mainstream, because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff.. like that sell-out britney spears.anyway, this was very painful for me to say because i don't want to see this, i don't wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers.. sales revenue and sales return.. i want to see magic, the magic that fellini, bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema.. because thats what pta is doing.. he is creating magic!!

i rented boogie nights last week and i could tell you, when i watched the film i had a blast. if you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn. i mean yes, if your not a porn person who can't bother being by it, than this isn't the film to see. but the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. the actors played there roles perfect, especially mark wahlberg, john c. reilly, and william h. macy. the sex scenes, of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles. excellent film, one of the best! hedeen's outlook: 10/10 **** a+

the brilliance of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience. this story is about success, it's about failure. it's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. the story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. keep this in mind as you watch the movie; it's more than eye candy. the sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.

boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and i'd go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250. i can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. i personally feel however as many do, judging from the aclaim this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making.the direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.there is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. the individual characters reach out and touch you. given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. the direction is among the best i've ever seen-and i've seen a lot of films.the film isn't about one particular personal individual's story, it's about many.it's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and though the film is long(i believe almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even notice. and when it ends you kind of don't want it to....i'm not easy to impress, meaning there aren't many movies i'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. i have never, in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.there was such flawlessness to it, you know it's not something your gonna see everyday.burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best i've ever seen him do, and mark wahlberg is incredible(i'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well. i don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that)but the person who really surprised me was heather grahem(rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo, towards the end.again, i'll echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody. but i still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.

boogie nights is full of surprises, nothing quite prepares one for it its soul. yes, it does have soul, whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter, with both a wry smile and respect. brillantly cast and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style.the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each "b grade" human being is brought, through crisis, into perspective.a sociologist's dream case study, the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, parental love and lack of it, attention/love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. something for everyone here.. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal.the film works on a number of levels. the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur, who happens to be watching the film...boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters, a rarity. it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more.

one of the things that i like about pt anderson, is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars. case in point, a washed-up... burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film. and if proving adam sander can be a great actor (punch drunk love) wasn't enough... here comes mark whalburg... like you've never seen before.i think many people pass up "boogie nights" cause they are anti-porn, or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film. but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves. there is a beautiful film... and it's too bad that enough people see that.

this is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence { just like curse of frankenstein from 1957} . if you don't like odd, non-mainstream films, steer clear of this masterpiece. for me, the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassete. the storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today. for being produced in the 1980s, this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with big government and big brother wanting to control and monitor us.there are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes { thats why i've watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all, it may prove to be well worth your time.the film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism . they are only concerned about accumulating and procreating. the hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been " tagged" and monitored by big brother. his mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow individulaism to once again be a part of humanity.yes, its very low budget, but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating. if you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.

this is not so much of a review as it is a testament that it has been proven, yet again, that the academy rewards money, not artistic accomplishment. and i must say i am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members have left this off the top 250. boogie nights is powerful, raw, and gutsy through script, direction and acting. very few movies can claim this triple crown.

paul thomas anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows eddie adams, aka dirk diggler (mark wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. his chance meeting with pornography director jack horner (burt reynolds) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. dirk's character is based on real-life porn actor john holmes, who, like dirk, was renowned for being extremely "well-endowed". this is where dirk finds initial success.the main themes in boogie nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. boogie nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. it is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on screen.throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously, and the film's setting, los angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film captures perfectly. however, boogie nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. for example at jack's party, they find a girl who has recently, and graphically, overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. the film, before this scenes, has been fairly upbeat and comic, but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur.the music scenes are executed brilliantly, from superbly-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out dirk singing terribly in his new music career. the soundtrack too is excellent, featuring tunes from the emotions, elo, the beach boys and the unforgettable sound experience. the standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music; dirk, redd rothchild (john c. reilly) and todd parker (thomas jane) visit drug dealer rahad jackson's (alfred molina) house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs, but night ranger's sister christian, which is playing in the background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. boogie nights is filled with those kind of scenes, which makes the film even more fantastic.the standout performance in boogie nights is burt reynolds as the enigmatic, yet moody, film director. in the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies, it is a complete shock for the audience, because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. other notable performances are julianne moore, heather graham as the beautiful rollergirl, john c. reilly, and mark wahlberg, who delivers the performance of his career.boogie nights is also a surprisingly original film, using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong, or at least until the 80s arrive. from then on, things turn very dark indeed, and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. this does not, however, reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers.boogie nights was not a box-office success, earning only ¬£2 million at cinemas in the uk. but this is not the film's, or the director's concern. anderson recognises quality, not popularity, which is evident in his three other films, hard eight, magnolia and punch-drunk love. i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will realize that boogie nights is a simple morality tale, but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. boogie nights is at once shocking, hilarious, devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.

boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at. sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from hitchcock to scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.where to begin, i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry-and what an industry it was! the other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber. but honestly, boogie nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema i haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius. the story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them. among the characters the two performances which stand out are: burt reynolds as director jack horner, and mark wahlberg as eddie adams/dirk diggler. julianne moore is also brillant, as is heather graham...but if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c. reilly. john's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...i'm a sucker for the line "ever see the movie star wars?...people say i look like han solo." anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the director of photography and director/writer/producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to martin scorsese, and stanley kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot i'ver ever seen...that being the new year's party sequence.the music, like in any great film, is a character of its own. at times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. ok, back to the performances.burt reynolds plays the character of jack horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "film" means to his genre. the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. the lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with. walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character. for all those individuals who have seen burton's planet of the apes, pay no attention to the performance of wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!julianne moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her. heather graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr. reynolds himself. each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.the film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's. it makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. but even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.

i've seen both movies and i saw without a doubt the re-make is the best, i know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re-make, but i thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, it was so good i'm going to see it again tonight, the original creeped me out because they kill the children, i mean who does that in movies anyway....but in this one the children have at least half a chance...the only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter (jill) walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the bushes to check for someone, clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst babysitting, so that is the only thing i found wrong with the movie, and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense, i don't want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it, i recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original, it would be a better movie for teenagers, as it displays things that most of us are scared of, but when i was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 in there watching it, and they enjoyed it, if they enjoyed it i think you will to! i give it a 9 out of 10!

i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie. i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money. i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is. little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling. the shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films, anything could happen in the film. the acting is by no means perfect, nor were they bad. the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her. in the end, i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects.it is definitely a film i would recommend.

i went to this film having no idea what to expect. i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it.i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. it's not as disjointed as liquid sky or as fanciful as forbidden zone. the original plot is very easy to follow. there's a lot of subtle humor.here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: a big-brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society. suddenly a new person appears and there's no data on him (he appears insane). he may or may not be the second-coming of christ. the over-cautious government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives. the ruler is also obsessed with immortality.some scenes are frantic while others are completely low-key. we follow the lead character as he encounters all different kinds of people in society.i didn't need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film, but i know that some of my friends felt that helped.split was also filmed around santa cruz and san francisco.

in a very-near-future world, a corrupt government monitors everyone constantly with computers and surveillance. one man has managed to evade assimilation, and operates outside the system, fighting to preserve his freedom. an engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work. there are some confusing and slow parts, but all in all, an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do on a shoestring budget.

i agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. here are some dialogue snippets:raisuli (sean connery) to eden pedecaris (candice bergen): "you see the man at the well, how he draws the water? when one bucket empties, the other fills. it is so with the world. at present, you are full of power. but you're spilling it, wastefully. and islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket." raisuli: the english have paid very well in the past. pedecaris: well you'll not have your way with the americans. president roosevelt will have your head for this. raisuli: roosevelt. this president roosevelt--he would try and take it himself? pedecaris: he certainly would! he is a man of grit and strong moral fiber. he does not kidnap women and children! raisuli: what kind of rifle does he use? pedecaris: a winchester! raisuli: winchester. winchester. i have no knowledge of this rifle. pedecaris: you will. teddy roosevelt (brian keith): the american grizzly bear is a symbol of the american character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. a little blind and reckless at times, but courageous beyond all doubt. oh, and one other trait goes with all previous. newspaper reporter: and that, mr. president? teddy roosevelt: loneliness. the bear lives out his life alone. indomitable. unconquered. but always alone. he has no real allies, only enemies--but none of them are as great as he. newspaper reporter: you feel this might be an american trait? teddy roosevelt: certainly. the world would never love us. it may respect us. it may even grow to fear us. but it'll never love us. for we have too much audacity. and we're a bit blind and reckless at times, too.

i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. seriously, i couldn't find anything wrong with it. one definite plus is how it was filmed. set in morrocco in 1904, the wind and the lion is filled with stirring images like the great raisuli on horseback especially. the cinematography was faultless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking. and i have to mention the music from jerry goldsmith, it was phenomenal. i have used this phrase a lot recently, but goldsmith ain't my favourite film composer for nothing. his score here is so rousing and exciting, it shows the man's true musical genius, and this gem of a score should be up there with goldsmith's best scores with legend, rambo:first blood, patton and the secret of nimh.the action is exhilarating and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated. the direction is sensitively handled too. the performances were astounding as well, with sean connery, ever the picture of charisma and suavity, magnificent as the great raisuli, he almost dominates the entire picture on his own. he is joined by a feisty candice bergen, a wily john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of his more understated performances. the history is fairly accurate, perhaps flimsy in some areas, but with the acting, music and visuals so good i am past caring. 10/10 bethany cox

the wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture. it is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.connery, despite the thick scottish brogue, plays the raisulu very well. he inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot. candice bergen, in one of her early roles, is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite mrs. pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and plenty of humour as well). a marvelous film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted. it is a tale that exemplifies the american spirit and the american character. this movie is a story from the early 20th century that is strangely relevant to the political landscape of the world in the beginning of the 21st century. it is a true classic.

the portrayal of the marines in this film is spot on. the action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content. the uniforms and weaponry of both the u.s. and german troops were perfect. the costumes and weaponry of the berbers were perfectly accurate as well. this film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the usmc academy for this purpose. the scenes depicting roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful. procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for. millius is a genius.

average adventure movie that took a serious story and "holywoodised" it.the watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie's place as a would be solid classic. why water down such a great storyline?probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat,just quick profits thank you.the directing,cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good.the screenplay was average.the charm of connery made up for his wrong arabic accent and all the scenes with president t. roosevelt were masterpiece takes.the costumes/sets here was very good.too bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demands.only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance/adventure holywood movies.....

in a morocco completely invaded by europeans and americans, in the beginning of the twentieth century, the moroccan leader mulay achmed mohammed el-raisuli the magnificent (sean connery) kidnaps the american eden pedecaris (candice bergen), her son and her daughter. his intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt sultan of moroco (marc zuber). in times of election, the american president theodore roosevelt (brian keith) agrees with the proposal. however, raisuli is betrayed and eden helps him to be released from the prison with the american soldiers. i do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries, but `the lion and the wind' is indeed a great adventure. the action scenes are very realistic. candice bergen, the most beautiful american actress in the 70¬¥s, is wonderful, performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie `soldier blue'. sean connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. brian keith is great as the american president. i do not know much about the morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. in brazil it is only available on vhs. my vote is eight.title (brazil): `o vento e o le√£o' (`the lion and the wind')

i just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. justthe memory of this movie right now enchants me. if you want tosee a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vividscenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early americacould have been like [what the world could have been like backthen]...well...i highly recommend this movie. especially during atime of war and conflict in iraq...when our american image is not atall what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when wewere just starting out. when being an american meant reallypicking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going. whenthe world was such an untamed and unknown place. well, thismovie has that...and more. enjoy.

got back from morocco then, where my dad was attached to the german embassy, when the film came out in europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the beauty of the country, where jimi had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa. sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in marrakech recently, the djema el fna was much wilder in those days than it is now; the stones went there earlier, brian recorded in tangiers ; so it's memories and family entertainment and i'm glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie. candice bergen looks beautiful and oo7/connery is pretty funny indeed; and teddy roosevelt as played by brian keith quite impressive.

now, lissen you guys, i loved this film, though not quite as much as farewell to the king, another beloved john milius epic. it was fun, a lot more than if it were based on a tennessee williams drama. it's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. i love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the bad guys (berbers) and the real bad guys, the spear- carriers for the acquisitive 'civilized' world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor. the standout scene is the berber encampment with blue-gray smoke from the cooking fires rising into the chill desert air. it is visually eloquent, highly evocative.set in 1904 morocco, wind features a helpless american woman (candace bergen) who is taken hostage by a dashing, albeit immodest, berber bandit (sean connery-the very model ofa scottish muslim nomad). the exciting story is based on a few historical facts. the photography is milius beautiful, punctuated by jerry goldsmith's outstanding score.mrs pedicaris and the raisuli conduct protracted foreplay and bounce around in the desert between oases. even though the raisuli proudly traces his lineage back to the apes, he is a perfect gentleman - he even lets her keep her head after she beats him at chess! a marine detachment storms the bashaw's palace, putting out the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline. don't mess with the corps, abdul. there are many entertaining stereotypes:despicable sultan - resembles a dissipated ferret. definitely not a liberal.cruel german officer - a large, bellicose dachshund sporting a monocle. he gallantly chooses to fight the raisuli with swords instead of gunning him down in the manner of indiana jones. noblesse oblige, by way of von clausewitz?dashing marine officer - kicks the crap out of the bashaw of tangier's army and storms his palace while chewing tobacco. his speech is mildly aphasic. the bashaw begged him not to breathe on him.the berbers - a horde of groveling sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac. none of them take baths, except perhaps in camel urine.president teddy roosevelt is undeservedly portrayed as vacuous and preoccupied with guns, toys and stuffed grizzly bears.beautiful american widow - gives the men a lesson in courage, as do her two children. she evidently has a huge supply of clean, starched clothes and rarely has a hair out of place. the raisuli sends teddy roosevelt a message, thanking him for the gift of a remington repeating rifle, declaring,"meester roosevelt, you are the lion and aiee am the breaking wind."how true.please do not take my acerbic remarks to mean that i did not like the film. i had almost as much fun writing this as watching da pitcher.

one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with "only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance/adventure holywood movies...," as if those weren't reason enough to love it! anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of the political motivations, or any other extra-movie concerns, simply doesn't love movies. see it and be awed by the star-power of the two leads, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film. this is proof that hollywood can "make 'em like they used to" when it really wants to. a solid 8/10.

okay,i'm a history buff,and okay,i'm a action film junkie,so of course,this film is on my top ten of all time.i really love the action scenes,and the unique weaponry of the period.i sort of have doubts about fighting two-handed sword from horse-back,and the raisuli sword seems more katana-like than scimitar-like,...oh well,i've never fought from horse back,either.i love the attempts at philosophic proverbs,too.the typical desert tribesman probably couldn't read the koran,so they'd take his word for it.several writers have criticized connery's brogue;well,on vacation as a youth,i met a family of south africans in our west,dinosaur national monument,and although they spoke africaans between themselves(yeah,second generation germans can hear the difference),they spoke english with a scottish brogue.seems that who teaches you affects your pronunciation.scottish missionary?

taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident "the wind and the lion" is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of africa.el raisuli (sean connery) head of an arab tribe kidnaps an american woman(candice bergen) and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of american president theodore roosevelt (brian keith). out of this simple plot john milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre.the outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photography, very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness. the musical score is also remarkable an fits accordingly.sean connery is very good as the arab leader and proofs he can handle almost any kind of role. so is candice bergen as the woman who shows strength under dangerous circumstances but deep inside is scared and has her weaknesses; she gets to admire connery and even understand his complete different focus on life arising from their also completely different cultures. brian keith plays one of his best roles ever as american president teddy roosevelt.most entertaining and very good cinematographic sample in the genre. give it chance, you won't regret it.

1904. the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence, as the various european powers - france, germany, britain, russia, spain, and now the united states - are vying for influence in the region. the sultan (marc zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, the bashaw (vladek sheybal), who is being manipulated by the french and germans, is the real power behind the throne. enter berber chieftan raisuli (sean connery), the leader of the rif tribe and "the last of the barbary pirates", who kidnaps an american missionary, eden pedecaris (candice bergen) and her two children and takes them hostage. back in the us, president theodore roosevelt (brian keith) threatens to go to war over the issue: "pedecaris alive or raisuli dead!" - seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his "big stick" diplomacy, though secretary of state john hay (john huston) is not so confident. however, the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises, who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event.john milius's great historical film, based very loosely off of a true story (i.e. pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful bit of escapism. it has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material, and does not overstay its welcome like, say, "pirates of the caribbean" or the "lord of the rings" movies. it's not really an "epic" film in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made.while the historical context is shaky, the storyline is interesting, and as some reviewers point out, it is even more pertinent today than it was when made. as president roosevelt says, "america is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. at the time of the film's setting, america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower, following their resounding victory in the spanish-american war - and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove america's worth. in real life, it didn't quite work out that way, but allegorically it works well. while written from a right-wing perspective, milius's screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world. he admires roosevelt and his method of "big stick" diplomacy, and correctly recognizes (in the words of roosevelt) that while america may be feared and respected, they'll never be truly "loved" by the world, no matter what they do. and there are some scenes - like roosevelt's target shooting of european leaders and the almost-comic surprise attack by marines on the bashaw's palace - which show america's reckless and violent side, while others - the climactic showdown with the germans - show their heroism.the historical/political context of the film is, of course, merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action/adventure film. there are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as raisuli's rescue of the pedecaris's from double-crossing tribesmen, which features some of the best swordplay in any film. the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces. and the final battle, which combines elements of "lawrence of arabia" and "the wild bunch", while a major historical fantasy (a three-way battle between germans, americans, and the rifs), is a superbly staged, adrenaline-pumping sequence.the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances. everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film, and it shows. sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent, but manages to pull off his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern, uncivil warfare. candice bergen, an actress whom i've never been fond of, gives a fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris, who is every bit as tough as her captor. brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr - you really feel he must have been like this, an athletic, blustering, yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self. the scenes of roosevelt boxing and target-shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest "bad ass" moments in movie history - and who can forget lines like "why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?" john huston provides solid support as the weary, cautious hay, acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt. among the fine supporting cast, the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue, and steve kanaly, as the gung-ho marine captain who cheerfully advocates (and carries out) "military intervention!" as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation. other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal, nadim sawalha, roy jenson, larry cross, marc zuber, and darrell fetty also do fine work, no matter how small their role. spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saint-john ("a fistful of dynamite") as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisuli's tribesmen."the wind and the lion" is, all around, a wonderfully done adventure film. it has something for everyone: wonderful gun- and swordplay, a lot of humor, a tough, feisty heroine (and her two cute children), a nice (if unconsummated) romance, and an interesting (if fanciful) political/historical context. it's not a masterpiece, but hey, it wasn't trying to be. i give "the wind and the lion" a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation.

why couldn't the end of the movie have been sean connery's men fighting the french instead of the germans. ever since the french had occupied algeria in 1830, the tribes from morocco and those of algeria were making raids on the french military and civilian settlements. this movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the french had seize the rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the french to free him.the movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the germans and the americans. when the americans shoot the germans, their guns (even the pistols) make loud noises, create large bloody bullet wounds, and their enemies are screaming after being shot. when germans shoot at the americans, their guns don't make large sounds, do not create bloody wounds, and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot.in real life, the american krag rifle was the worst rifle america had ever produce until the early version of the m-16 came along. the krag was hard to maintain, not reliable, and the rifle bolt was always jamming. the german mauser was one of the world's finest rifles. we were so impress by it during spanish american war, that we made a copy of it and call it the springfield rifle.finally, the people of morocco must had a word for artillery since the french were using them in their raids against morocco. i didn't like it when they made the rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the moorican vocabulary. instead, the rasuadli stated that the europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake.

this is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch, with a great cast and a good story, based on true events.it's interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events. it's above all for most part an adventurous story, with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an arabic world. so, lots of sword fighting, good old fashioned honor, religion and a rich proud country. but the movie is also filled with humor, to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch.the constant cutting back and forth between the morocco plot involving sean connery and candice berger and the american plot line involving theodore roosevelt (brian keith) wasn't the best possible approach in my opinion. the two things have totally different paces, totally different characters, it are just totally different worlds! of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out. it doesn't at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed. the american plot line is most of the time more political while the morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and action filled. in the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or roosevelt in this movie was. seem that john milius is just a big admirer of him. often the american plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced morrocan plot line. after all, john milius always has been at his best as an action director.it isn't until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam. the most- and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in. especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint. i wish the entire movie was like this. that way this movie would had also been a better known one, no doubt.the movie has a great jerry goldsmith musical score, that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself. the movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it. appereantly the movie only costs $4,000,000 to make but that is really hard to believe, considering the settings and size of the movie. i mean john milius his best known movie "conan the barbarian" cost about $20,000,000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale.quite funny to see an arabic speak with a big fat scottish accent but hey, it's sean connery so you just simply tend to accept this. he suits his role well. so does candice bergen. it's always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages. also john huston plays a great role in this movie!a perfectly fine watchable movie!7/10

writer/director john milius takes a little-known incident from american history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. the result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable, larger-than-life roles: sean connery as the wily arab sheik with an inexplicable scottish brogue, and brian keith as president theodore roosevelt, itching for the chance to put that "big stick" to good use.aided immeasurably by billy williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable jerry goldsmith, this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries lucas, coppola and spielberg. although milius served up tantalizing glimpses of his ability in scripts for jeremiah johnson and apocalypse now, his career seemed to take a downward turn not long after he started directing, ultimately foundering on dreck like conan the barbarian and red dawn. here's hoping that he will again find his way.

this is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. it is about history, america, the change of times, teddy roosevelt, morocco, a kidnapped american and her children, and the leader of the berbers, with the blood of the prophet in his veins.this movie is based on a true story--like jesse james was a banker. an american was kidnapped in morocco and the marines went part-way to the shores of tripoli to rescue him. so much for that. you know hollywood. sean connery is the berber chieftain and muslim leader. candice bergan is the guy who was kidnapped, along with her two kids; the son is rex harrison's grandson, simon, no less. john huston is secretary of state, with a great john-huston-style straight line at a state dinner, watch out for it. brian kieth is teddy roosevelt, all-american, all-male, a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today.the sweep and beauty of the desert and morocco are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film, which will stay with you, a haunting and compelling memory. the score is as sweeping and exotic as the images.this is a story about two cultures, both with grand ideas and historic pasts, struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another. in any event, the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity.then at the last, there is the little boy--remember the little boy? what do you think he thinks?

i saw 2 hour version of choker bali. i cannot say that is long. the movie has a certain natural pace to it and does not seem to lag at any time. the costume and the set are reminiscent of what we would see in old movies.aishwarya rai has done a good job of acting. it is indeed a mature role with enough scope for acting within the story. the script also supports the story very well. aishwarys acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. the movie is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the downtrodden condition of widows in those times.her best friend in this movie is played by raima sen has also been well-handled. her innocence and her admiration of aishwarya's capability to speak english and act educated has been done very well. these are indeed some of the prevailing mindsets of those times. we can see how far we have come from such an era! the movie speaks of womens liberation as subtle line of the story. i found the development of the story very similar to ghare bahire also written by tagore. it does rope in some action from the independence struggle and puts in contrast the struggle for indian independence against the silent struggle for womens rights.a well made movie definitely worth watching. aishwarya's acting: par excellence. rituparna has handled the story with great care. yet another classic from rabindranath tagore.

chokher bali ¬ñ a passion play.based on rabindranath tagore's novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. set in 1900 bengal, director rituparno ghosh transformed the nobel laureates' acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat.tagore's story elaborately deals with the bengali society, through his central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live a life of her own. we are taken into the picturesque part of bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful, young widow binodini (aishwarya rai).despite her gorgeous looks, two handsome men, the rich mahindra (prosenjit chatterji) and his friend behari (toto roychowdhury), denied marrying her.mahindra chooses a naive ashalata (raima sen) over binodini and marries her. leaving behind the country life, the free-spirited binodini accompanies mahindra's mother to calcutta as a caretaker. soon, her friendship with ashalata flourishes. it looks like, the two, addressing each other as 'chokher bali' (sand in the eyes), share an enduring bond. the english-speaking binodini captures a special place in the house. but, soon, she unmasks her real face. manipulating good-natured ashlata, binodini gets closer with mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires.when, she is thrown out by the enraged mother of mahindra, binodini seeks solace from a reluctant behari. the remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax¬Ö aishwarya walks through the role¬óa manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the viewer's sympathy¬ówith a ballet dancer's elegance. the other lead artistes¬óprosenjit chatterjee, raima sen and toto roychowdhury¬óare equally brilliant, in enacting their characters.while tagore penned this 'mould-breaking' story at the turn of the 20th century, the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper class! narrating the nations' freedom movement in parallel, the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life. kudos to the art director, who gave life to the early 20th century bengal, and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve.this 'passion play,' by tagore, has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality.

chokher bali was shown at the (washington) dc filmfest april 15, 2005. the director, rituparno ghosh, was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards.as always, i think aishwarya did a fantastic job. i can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy, but would that really be realistic in 1904? possible, maybe; realistic, i'm not so sure. i think her interpretation was valid, although there could certainly be other ways to do it.i hate to use the word, but this was the most "inaccessible" of the indian movies i have seen so far. i know a fair amount of indian history, hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far beyond me. clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with hinduism and its customs, esp. as they were c. 1904. i missed a lot of things--one of them being the fact that the mother-in-law would want binodini in the house as sort of a counter-weight to her daughter-in-law ashalata.*spoilers* ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me. first, the original bengali version was 20+ minutes longer. so what was left out? apparently three main things: a beginning segment where binodini (aishwarya) leaves e. bengal for calcutta. according to the director, different characters are speaking w. bengali vs. e. bengali--setting up some of the political comments later. of course all of this is lost in the hindi version, and certainly to a non-indian like me, it wouldn't have mattered anyway--but a set-up of the bengali situation sure would have. next, there was a segment where binodini was writing a poem--a sign of her independence, etc. finally, some more business about the jewellery. so, although some people think it was too long, i think the original, longer version would have been clearer.the women's hair was apparently another sign (ghosh again)--the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for hindu widows), her sister--also a widow--had longer hair (more modern!), and of course binodini/aishwarya had extremely long waist-length hair (rejection of status of widowhood).the ending really threw me--all of a sudden binodini, who had never had a political thought, is writing a political manifesto? whoa! ghosh explained that he was in locarno, at a film festival, when the subtitles were done. the subtitles use the word "country" throughout binodini's letter. gosh said a more appropriate word would have been (i forget his exact word) something like "self" or "independence"--she was talking about her own liberation and "finding herself"--not about bengal, india, and the british. so why does binodini just disappear the day after finding behari again? apparently because during her stay on the ganges she realizes that she doesn't need a man--any man--to define/complete her. she can just be herself. so she rejects behari, who she threw herself at a few months (?) before, and just goes off. of course i'm not sure how she buys her next meal, but that's another question.the red shawl (ghosh again)she buys represents "revolution" as well as "passion." i'm not 100% sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman, but perhaps she is rejecting passion/revolution? the binoculars, which binodini uses throughout the movie (to watch mahendra and ashalata, the boat on the ganges, etc.). she is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but can't have. at the end (i missed this!) she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter, showing that she doesn't need them any more--she's going off to lead her own life.finally, the tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending... apparently tagore wrote this as a serial, hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits. but at the end he sold out to conservatism and had binodini kneel down at the feet of mahendra and behari, begging their forgiveness. one of his students (?) wrote to tagore taking him to task for his sell-out ending...and tagore replied with his apology for the ending. in the movie, of course, ghosh goes in the other direction.

i¬¥ve been able to see this great movie at the fantasyfilmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down *g*! i¬¥ve really seen lots of movies and there are just a few i¬¥d call perfect like fight club or koyaanisqatsi! subconscious cruelty is now one of them! half of the people watching it in berlin went out of the room and i can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his/her perfect world day by day dreaming his/her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet-in our life! i don¬¥t think i have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page! it¬¥s a movie that shows everything and more!!! gets 10 points + from 10!!! it¬¥d be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e-mail!so far i haven¬¥t met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as i am!!! finally sorry for my bad english-i¬¥m not a studied person (und das ist auch gut so!!! :-))))))

i¬¥ve seen this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being "drugged down"! i¬¥ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that i¬¥d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight club-subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them!!! half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely! this is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! a person that is living in his/her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film! if someone reads this now who has seen s.c. and also thinks it¬¥s great: just contact me-so far i haven¬¥t met anyone who shares my opinion-it¬¥d be cool!!! this film earns 10 points out of 10!!! finally i¬¥m really sorry for my bad english-i¬¥m not a studied person!!! (und das ist auch gut so *g*)

the dreams of karim hussain are to be feared. when the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment, and various abominations are released. religion won't save you, nor will mother nature or your own family. hussain's dark poetry, because that's what this film really is, destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary.`subconcious cruelty' is a current crowd pleaser on the horror\fantasy festival circuit. the film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. the protagonist's desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic. from here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature. hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. nature is exposed as blood-drenched and violent in hussain's frightening enlightenment.`subconcious cruelty' is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life, lust and madness this very worthy film explores. cj goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up, as do david kristian for unnerving sound design and teruhiko suzuki for score.

when you have waited years to see a film that you have heard on the grape vine about obviously your expectations are high right? f**k yeah!but when this baby dropped through my door little did i know what f***ed up visuals would grace my tv and warp my fragile mind. first off karim hussein is a film fan like all of us growing up on a diet of argento/fulci/lynch etc.....and it shows in this film, but in a good way. although i didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first watch of this gem i was just amazed by the visuals,the lighting and of course the performances from everyone who was involved karim must have truly believed that he was going to push the boundaries in film-making(which trust me he does)and that he was going to have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same........so what can i tell you about "subconscious cruelty"?well without spoiling it....its a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness which toils into madness.....a truly unforgettable experience.......keep you eye on karim hussein he can only go onto better things.....i viewed the full uncut print of subconscious cruelty on a double disc dvd from infliction films which is loaded with extras.....please note there is a censored hong kong release out there avoid this version.

this review may contain spoilers! the decline of western civilization......what a great title eh? and of coarse a great movie. this is the best concert film i have ever seen. a close second being the talking heads movie "stop making sense". i first heard of this movie when waynes world came out in 1992. i looked at the director's name penelope spheeris and thought cool name, what else has he directed? i thought the first name was pronounced like envelope. after some time looking in movie guides i came across the critically acclaimed decline and realized penelope was a woman.....my mom corrected me. i spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down. i finally saw it on vhs in vancouver, where i currently reside. it was worth the wait. this captures the la punk movement very well. this is teen angst at it's best folks. my favourite is the band the germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because darby crash sings so crazy, you cannot understand it. i laughed when i saw this. the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band x are a very intelligent bunch. also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the whales, there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in! i became a huge penelope spheeris fan after this, and saw all her punk movies-dudes was ok, and suburbia is a cult classic! i own both of these on vhs. she is a true underground film maker and i love her stuff. i would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular. i was a big nirvana fan then, but alas i saw this in 2002 and by that point i had grown out of grunge and now i listen to crystal method/fatboy slim. quite a change of pace, i know, but what can you do? but if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything. much better than 1991: the year punk broke. this is a tough movie to track down, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you don't like the music it is an excellent piece of work. now days it might be easier to find with dvd's being so popular. by the way penelope produced a little known albert brooks movie called "real life" which i also own. very funny stuff in todays reality tv craptacular! rent decline......highly recommended! thanks!

i love this film. it was made just before the la punk scene changed for the worse. it perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. i feel really lucky to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at the fleetwood that night. the only part that doesn't fit in too well is the sections with catholic disipline and their socio-political commentary. i didn't see too many people who were into that at all. the rest of the film shows attitudes that i witnessed a lot; people dealing with hard lives, or taking a swing at the music industry and/or lousy hippies. i don't think i've seen a documentary that captures so authentically and personally the subject matter being covered.

absolutely one of the 10 best music films ever! a totally essential educational experience for any music fanatic--especially young rock/punk fans today...understanding the beginnings of any particular "artistic" movement absolutely requires understanding the roots of the music,as well as the mindset and musical environment of the times....not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. and,besides all that,this documentary is flat-out rock-n-roll f u n !! do not miss it!!! that said,can anyone tell me when,if ever, "the decline of western civilization"...part 1,( not part 2,the metal version) will be made available again..hopefully on dvd?

the decline series is amazing and director ps can't get enough credit for making these movies. i'm slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one, or the other two, but their worth unearthing if you want the picture of punk in the trans-formative years between the late seventies and early eighties. the film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band x. many interviews with bands and punker's that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder. no internet, crappy jobs, and all out hostility collide in this genre. for new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock. all the band performances (and there are many) are awesome, especially fear who never cease to amaze me. this and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people. it's true punk, like in the interview with darby crash's girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously/suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out, they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the emt's had a chuckle on this one, and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house, the response "no i hate painters". how about black flag renting their apartment/rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month! my jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400. between watching this and deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period, just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way. the people and bands associated with the movie paved the way for what harder music today is, and they did it in their own unique way. brilliant film, ten stars, see part 2 as well its equally awesome, part 3 though, i don't know what to say about.

crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the australian suburban lawn bowls club of cityside. mick molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces at cityside. when the club is put under pressure to install poker machines in it's premises they need to raise $8000 to keep this from happening. the club needs new members to help and this is where mick molloys character comes in and has to bowl to save the club. with many up and coming and aging australian actors crackerjack is a hidden gem. be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief. sam johnson and judith lucy co-star. overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn bowls or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding. if you enjoy australian humour i suggest you get you're bowling whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn bowls comedy of the year(also the only one).

this movie would had worked much better if this was the first critters movie, this is a low-budget movie with only two (2) critters shown on-screen. why this looks like a fail is because this is the last critters movie and it's so low-budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. however, i did like this movie, i compare it mostly with the third movie (which were bad). critters 4 have a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing one critter yet) you have a scary feeling watching it, too bad they didn't "milk" out the critters, i mean even if they only had two (2) puppets they could still have used them on-screen a lot more. the critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special, especially at the end with the frozen critter. ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise. lastly i liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see a critters 5 anymore. oh, one last thing, i missed one scene in this movie, we never see a critter shoot a spike from its back, maybe these puppets didn't have that feature, but i was very disappointed not seeing that (in critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting, which was the only good thing i liked about that movie).

critters 4 ranks as one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. the word classic has never been so aptly used as in describing this mind-blowing epic. i agree that the original critters is the best of the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which critters 4 is set really must be seen to be believed. i strongly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of twentieth century's major film landmarks.

this film is a fine example of why the shaw brothers are among the finest directors (probably the best in the kung fu category). the movie is well paced, the story is excellent and intriguing, and while the humor may not be in your face, it is nested within the character interactions. once the story builds up, and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes (tiger, crane and crab hung gar are very present). there is even a scene that mocks 18th century western social events, and ends with clever and entertaining fighting. the movie ends with a sudden, cheesy moment, but if you are a fan of the shaw brothers, you'll understand that the cheese is just a topping, and not the main course of the movie.

my young auntie is unique in a lot of ways. first this is hui ya-hung's (kara hui) first action film. second she was actually doing the fight scenes after having a surgery done to her a few days before filming. third this movie is off the chain.the movie starts out with wang lung wei trying to take the inheritance from his brother. his brother then has kara to marry him so wang can't take the treasure. the story is pretty good leading everything to it's rightful place.in comes the action, what can i say that hasn't already been said for movies like this, or disciples of the 36th chambers, the victim, or even the magnificent butcher. the fight scenes are what sales movie, and this one won't have any problem doing so. liu chia liang and wang lung wei engaged in a fight that you have to see to believe. why have these two men not fought each other more is beyond me.i don't want to spoil anything really, but you have to see my young auntie to get the full blast of excitement. my only gripe is that yuen tak was not used as broad as he was used in 3 evil masters, or even invincible pole fighter (8 diagram pole fighter) to excellent must see movies. 9.2/10

if you're looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. while there are fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who struggles to find her way in americanized canton. unlike most "kung-fu comedies," the action scenes are used to reinforce the comedy, instead of the other way around.cheung booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kung-fu movies, where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight. instead of some grand drama about honor and respect, minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other up.my young auntie, as it's known in the west, is the story of cheng tai-nun, played by kara hui, who is a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to keep his holdings from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. after he dies, she moves to canton to live with her nephew, played by director lau kar leung, and his son ah tao, played by hsiao ho.the basis of the irony is that although cheng is the same age as ah tao, her manner is more akin to her status as his step-great-aunt. while ah tao speaks english (extremely poorly), plays the guitar and goes to costume parties, cheng utterly fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in canton, complete with makeup, revealing gowns, high heels and dance scenes.what makes this movie great is its realization. lau kar leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest director of his generation in hong kong, and kara hui won "best actress" at the first hong kong film awards in 1982. also, this is arguably hsiao ho's finest performance. his chemistry with hui is remarkable, and although he went on to have a storied career in kung-fu comedies, often working alongside sammo hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. as the romantic tension and intrigue build in the second half of the movie, his entire countenance changes. no longer does he easily jaunt through life without a care in the world. he becomes the straight man and his cohorts the kramer, elaine and george.my one complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film die off during the conclusion. the film transitions from outright farce to dramatic intrigue with little but a change in incidental music. but there is a certain symmetry in it. the film begins focused on the intrigue, focused more on lau kar leung's character, and it ends that way, too. but the final scene returns to the movie's comedic roots, giving conclusion to both aspects of the film.

this is one of the great modern kung fu films. a lot of the reviews seem to miss the point that the comedy is based on a quite subtle at times (at other times right in your face) contrast between old and new china. kara hui for instance is called a country bumpkin and gets into trouble whenever she tries to adapt to the new but in the end to save her families honour dresses as an old fashioned heroine in contrast to the modern military style of hsiao ho. gordon liu seems to have played his part for laughs playing off his serious, monk persona with silly wigs and a guitar. the end fight is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for johnny wang rather than death. kwan yung moon should be mentioned for his great playing of a thug with 'invincible armour' - simply terrific. and kara hui does some magnificent acting and fighting. a great film.

some martial-arts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old-school kung-fu flick; and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the "chop-socky" period in hong kong film. but the fact is, one can only carry-on a primarily physical exhibition of prowess for just so long, then everyone gets bored with it. and that's really why the chop-socky died and how the hong kong "new wave" action film was born: the producers, the actors, the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninety-minutes straight.given that, and given the fact that liu chia liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume, this film has to be seen as something other than just another kung-fu comedy. rather, it is a comic film within the martial-arts genre, and in fact one of the best ever made.what liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise: he has taken a martial-arts plot and re-constructed it along the lines of a hollywood-style musical! complete with episodes of singing and dancing! it was around the time of the making of this film that some film-makers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martial-arts (really derived from the acrobatics of the chinese opera) has more in common with dance than with fighting. (i will continue to point out this connection until most americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film - well-choreographed body movements, using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance.) at any rate, quite clearly liu chia liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limits.the result is an incredibly charming entertainment, filled with marvelously human characters attempting miraculous kung-fu (and tripping over their own shoelaces as often as not when they do so). and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, allows liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the westernization and modernization of china that contributed so greatly to the making of the china we know today. so the film has considerable historical import as well.also, fans of stephen chow's recent kung fu hustle should really watch this movie carefully, as chow clearly learned from it before the making of his own film.a very amusing, well-made film. oh, yes, and the kung fu in it is really, really good.purists won't admit it, but this is probably director liu's best film.

el padrino has just been released in europe and is really kicking ass. this film with its great cast - damian chapa ( blood in blood out ), robert wager, jennifer tilly, robert wagner and many more ) - is the best gangster movie since scarface. a film that everyone must see. 2 hours full of action with fantastic unbelievable stunt !!!!gracias jennifer !!!! we are eagerly waiting for part 2 !!!! does anyone know if there will be one ? keep up the good work !!! i loved it !!

i have seen this film more then once. actually el padrino was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of time.there was a big cast jennifer tilly, faye duanway, brad dourif, and damian chapa who really shined like a real star in this part of kilo.i heard this film was shot for under two million dollars. i have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value.damian chapa why are you not getting offers and more film work!!! excellent job!!!!!!!!!! i cant wait to see the sequel, and i hope it has the same action.jennifer tilly has made a cult classic character with sabeva.damian chapa moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's so sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like ben stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show. a great film.go go go kick some but in sales el padrino!!!

i just finished screening el padrino in germany. a great film. we look forward to seeing more films from mr. chapa in the future. it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic. the ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. seeing a film with great quality truly outlines chapa's serious potential and his adept skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. chapa has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control. something that few film makers can afford.

we just finished screening el padrino in australia. a phenomenal piece of film work. we look forward to seeing many more films from mr. chapa in the future. it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic. seeing a film with great quality truly outlines chapa's serious potential and his adept skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. chapa has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control. with his lead role kilo vasquez being a perfect combination between milo velka from "blood in blood out" and al pacino from "scarface" the film will do wonders for us here in australia.

i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.we have all seen this plot line before (top gun, gi jane, an officer and a gentleman) but a good script still works. this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines. kevin costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader, ben randall, who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission. the movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the costner character and that of jake fischer, played by ashton kutcher. i am happy to say that ashton is great in this part.there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives. however, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ben randall "do his own thing as a trainer", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained. i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud, gasp here and there, and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie.we all had a good time (despite a couple of tough moments in the movie)and, i think, you will too.

when i saw this movie at age 6, it was in the childrens' section at erols video because it was animation. we watched it and it was a whole different ball game! a very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and compelling, but not for children. avoid for family viewing, my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart!

this was a great anime. true the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than ninja scroll, the problem that it was kinda long.japanese movie star hiroyuki sanada who played ujio from last samurai played the main character jiro and it was directed by rintaro who did galaxy express 999 and metropolis.the anime has some good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain tenkai and ando shouzan and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film.all in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action, and samurai/ninja flicks. despite the lows in the film that didn't the film from being a great film to watch.don't miss this film.

this is an excellent anime movie. it is well animated, has a good intricate plot and very good music. i understand that some may think of it as a little long, but i think that it is a good length and the animation is good traditional anime.three characters:the way they use tenkai is masterly. for example the body double showing up at all these locations adds to the ominous tone of the movie. the design of tenkai is good too, the way he looks as a monk and in the end scene the armour he is wearing.the old man andou is down to earth and a very likable character. when jiro meets him it's a turning point in the movie.sanpei, the satsuma shinobi who infiltrated tenkais clan saves jiros life twice. he stays in the background most of the movie though, but he is really one of the heroes of the movie.the plot: the plot is good. it is traditional without being unoriginal. the historical time it is acted out in is interesting, the meiji restoration. the treasure is sought after by tenkai to restore the shogunate while when jiro finds it he uses it to help the anti-shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate.the way tenkai tricks jiro is interesting and has sort of a "hamlet" feel to it. there is also a sweet irony to the fact that if tenkai had not gotten jiro to become a shinobi i don't think that he had been able to kill him in the end(maybe by firearm, but not hand to hand combat weapons).the plot with all the death makes it mostly very dark, but there's some light moments when we see some of jiros childhood memories. all in all it's a good, dark, intricate plot.the music: the opening theme for example is very good with the electric guitar and drums. they occasionally in that piece use what i believe to be taiko drums, but i'm not sure.there is a lot of good music. like the one played while they are traveling to the iga shinobi. i believe the piece is called "numatou" and has an incredible flute in it. the flute might be a pan flute, but more probably a shakuhachi.the end theme "kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. the vocals are beautiful and so is the song in general.the animation:the animation, while good, is not perfect and the blood that runs down the characters do sometimes appear to be orange. the transitions are interesting and i think some transitions are very nice. one example of a nice transition is when jiro and the iga shinobi are running, there is the sunset in the background and the music is playing. the transition is simple, but effective and has a nice feeling too it.my final words: i think that the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make this into one of the best anime movies i have ever seen.

i enjoyed this for a couple of reasons. the emotional tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved, but the blend of newsreel footage with the film's narrative was often compelling. the other element that i appreciated was the depiction of the werewolves, the fanatical nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender. i don't know of another film that deals with them. they assassinated burgomaster oppenhoff of aachen on palm sunday, 1945, for example, and did create problems for the occupation. the film, then, challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities. the "human issues" are presented not so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived hitler -- both conquered and victors.

samuel fuller knows war, and is one of the only directors in american movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture. his pessimism and idealism, if that sounds a little odd to mix together, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he's always out to tell the truth, however brutal (or put into melodramatic constructs) it can get. verboten, however, deals with the post-war experience, as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of war- in bold for a point. the opening shot is like one big exclamation point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera pans up, we see another soldier shot down in war-torn terrain. simple, direct language. then fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity, and then beethoven music over a shoot-out between americans and the nazis. sgt david brent (james best) is shot, the battle goes on, and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds.it might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional ww2 flick (somewhat in that one usually wouldn't find beethoven and, later on to an extent, wagner put into these images), but this isn't the case. instead, fuller makes this a 'coming home' kind of movie, though not at all in the sense that 'this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on'. instead of really going home, brent stays on in germany, as he's fallen head over heels for the woman, helga (susan cummings, pretty good at pulling off the german accent), and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her. what he doesn't realize is that a) she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother, however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt brent, and b) there's an underground hitler youth sect called the werewolves, who want to pick right up off where hitler ended- starting small, despite argument within the group- by attacking the very government that's now embedded in germany to give them, as brent describes, a "blood transfusion." with this, plus footage from the nuremburg trials, and (as narrated, i think, by fuller himself) a quick, no-punches-pulled history of the nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multi-faceted look at a society in the dire straits of an immediate post-war environment. while rossellini handled it his own way with germany year zero, fuller tackles it with layers: first there's the love story, or what is the tragic downfall of a man who can't see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable, that it's his wife and a child on the way that he can't leave, until the revelation that he's (partly) been swindled. baker and cummings, along with harold daye as helga's young, confused brother, perform at with the utmost detail to emotions; these aren't very easy b-movie parts, though they could've been that. then another layer is the political one, the struggle of a society to come to grips with being conquered, and a mentality which is made sensationalized, to be sure, by fuller, in respect to making the nazi's a total no-gray-area thing: they're evil, particularly when they cancel out reason to meet their ends.and finally there's the layer of style, which is strangely absorbing. this is probably one of fuller's 'talkiest' films, which isn't a bad thing considering it's one of his best written scripts, as the characters don't talk simply or in too many platitudes (with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the hitler youth as juvenile delinquents, which is actually, according to fuller's autobiography, probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies). and fuller shoots this almost in a real european style, when he's not going for fight scenes or battles, as the editing isn't always very fast, and sometimes a cut won't happen for a full minute, or longer. there's an odd tension that grows out of this, especially when there's something said by a character that gets another one wild-eyed or suspicious; fuller could easily go for a big close-up, but there's a more sinister, cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple over-the-shoulder deal. but when it requires it, like the big brawl outside the american military office, or the nuremburg footage spliced into franz's memories of the werewolves, fuller can be as stunning stylist as ever.very hard to find, but extremely worth it if you'r either a fan of the director's or of ww2 movies set in germany- or even just a history-buff- verboten! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one, with a cast that is better than expected from a b-movie, and an attitude towards the 'other' that is equally damning and thought provoking.

one of fuller's (a combat veteran himself) early works of average quality, but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar germany. the main character starts the movie in apr'45 as a sgt with c co, 157th inf, 45th div, which really did end the war in munich as in the movie. (same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the dachau facility). to the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good & bad of the german people. but anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45-47 germany. the only inaccuracy i noticed was minor: while on a boat cruise of the rhine passing the remains of the remagen bridge he comments he crossed there. but his unit really crossed well south of there - north of worms germany.

great film about an american g.i. who quits the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. she accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him, or because he can support her with easier access to food and such? meanwhile, her brother and an old friend form an anti-american terrorist group called the werewolves, their purpose to drive away the occupants (you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von trier's film europa (zentropa)). james best, best known for his role as roscoe p. coltrane in the 1980s television show the dukes of hazzard, is shockingly excellent as the american. he should have become a big movie star ¬ñ at this age he reminds me very much of warren beatty. the other main actors are good, as well. fuller's direction is quite good, using a lot of long takes again (although they are not nearly as complex as they were in park row; the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue). the only problems lie in the script, as seems to be the case with all of the fuller films that i've seen. it's not too badly flawed, but it ought to have been expanded, fleshing out major characters and parts of the script. helga, the wife, goes through a major change, but completely off screen. therefore, the emotional center rests squarely on best's shoulders. fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film. i hope that doesn't sound too harsh! she just doesn't really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed. she has so few lines. but fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on. i would have had her death solidify david and helga's relationship myself. and the film ends too abruptly, and it lacks payoff. these aren't really the biggest flaws in the world (the way i described them makes them sound bigger than they are). 9/10.

just got this in the mail and i was positively surprised. as a big fan of 70's cinema it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks. despite the obvious low budget on this movie, the acting is overall good and you can already see why pesci was to become on of the greatest actors ever. i'm not sure how authentic this movie is, but it sure is a good contribution to the mob genre.....

i don't know if it's fair for me to review this. i'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. i've never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers. when the godfather came out, i thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a series of well-acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them. this one is obviously low-budget, but it is certainly well done. at some point in all of these i feel like i want to take a shower. if such characters actually exist, it is hard for the soul. i always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing. this kind of crud has to be stopped. i hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies. why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment? in fairness, i am judging this on the acting and directing, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.

first off let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in 72. i absolutely loved this movie, it's very urban, gritty, no real hollywood glam added to it.. you can actually feel for all of the characters in here, i love the blood just splattering abound in here. joe pesci was pretty good in here, but to me it seems like he was definitely outdone by the lead character joe cortese, now i don't know anything about him , but boy can he really act.. i believe this movie is probably true, because living in new jersey,, living close to philly, you here this kinda thing all the time. i think that if the movie had a bigger budget , and say robert deniro as jerry's boss you would have a perfect movie, but hey who am i to argue, i was so engrossed by this film, that it is already up there in my mind, with mean streets. i wish hollywood would go back to this urbanized, gritty display of movie making: it would serve them very well to do so. this movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and i highly recommend it to anyone.

out of all the mafia movies i have ever seen this is one of the best for many reasons. the acting from pesci, cortese and vincent. the story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre), as it realistic. the characters are people that lots of other people can relate to. this movie is also great as it's dialogue is good. it also has very realistic fights and action scenes. this movie also launched the careers of pesci and vincent. if it weren't for the success of this film, casino and goodfellas might not have been as good as they were. story 10/10 acting 9/10 realism 10/10overall 10/10my fave mafia movies are1: goodfellas 2: casino 3: the godfather trilogy 4: family enforcer (the death collector) 5: the sopranos (i know it isn't a movie)

a very surprisingly underrated movie. very realistic. and authentic .with great dialogue. being italian, i can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used. i thought joe cortese was great. as a crazy mob cowboy type, and pesci and vincent were great also. i liked the actor criscuolo who played the boss. he was very authentic. i think the director ralph devito was on his way to great things , but was cut down too early , maybe because he knew too much. i thought it was great. it deserved more airplay and recognition. it was a sleeper movie. great. very good. it really had good authenticity. it was well done.

the death collector is truly a wonderful film. labeled as a mean streets ripoff, it has some really great stuff in it. a lot of the stuff in this movie would later be used by scorsese himself, including the actors - joe pesci, frank vincent, etc.

a very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in new jersey. the story, characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball. still, it's worth watching, especially for the strong images, some still with me even though i first viewed this 25 years ago.a young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things (tries to) but these things keep going wrong, leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being skimmed off, not a good place to be if you enjoy your health, or life.this is the film that introduced joe pesce to martin scorsese. also present is that perennial screen wise guy, frank vincent. strong on characterizations and visuals. sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish, but a great story.

"let me ask you one more question" ha ! what a great soon .. this movie was brilliant fantastic acting, great script. the only reason no-one noticed it was because of the low budget everyone will agree with me that its a cult just like "donnie brasco" it shows a young joe pesci once again as a mobster, this film is up their with the cults. its got some sopranos and some goodfellas chase got his idea for the sopranos when he watched this and scorsese found joe pesci while watching it, that proves it must be a great am i right or am i wrong 'eh ?. i've got to admit they showed one brilliant scene where they were throwing peanuts at a camp piano player "stop with the friggen peanuts".

it was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching. the acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people. i was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as "raging bull" and "goodfellas" in this movie a great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing.

i agree with vince, this movie paved the way for goodfellas. the scene where pesci was throwing peanuts at the piano player reminded me of his "how am i funny?" routine in goodfellas. this is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention. as with many other mob films, the theme of the death collector rings true: always respect the don.

surprisingly good "mean streets"-type crime drama. foreshadows elements of "goodfellas" and "casino". joe pesci's first big role. clever dialog. i think the maltin guide gives this a bomb rating. i can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it.saw this at tarantino's film fest and he said scorsese used a number of these actors in raging bull.

i saw a version of this in a 4 dvd mafia collection put out by brentwood and i have to admit that it was a good film. the quality was a little worse for the wear, but it was a well acted and realistic drama involving low level new jersey gangsters. pesci once again though, steels the show!

has anyone ever read or heard comments by scorsese or david chase ( soprano's exec. producer) about "death collector/family enforcer"? i bought the dvd after not having seen it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but having seen "goodfellas" and the entire "sopranos" run to date. in retrospect, both guys must have seen death collector/family enforcer and absorbed the flavor ,perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks, both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized godfather trilogy. being a jersey guy, it is interesting to see how the jersey meadowlands have evolved since the mid-70's. it is not the swampy dumping ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local waterway. also, it's a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed world trade center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene. who could have imagined?

so ya think you've seen every mafia movie ever made! here's one that nobody every heard of. it's a low-budget, quickie b-movie - shot in the swamps of jersey. for us mob-movie fans, it had a little bit of everything - sex, violence, cursing, and wise guys acting like "gafones". while violence dominated the movie, i found myself laughing at some familiar scenes i've since seen on the sopranos and goodfellas. look for a 1977 version of the "badabing girls" in the beginning of the movie. all our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here. and, as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! joe pesci was superb, portraying the classic wise-guy character like we seen him do so many times over the years. this was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick. you have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names. my copy called it "the family enforcer". here it is known as "the death collector". but whatever name it goes under, it's should be called - a winner.

very good 1970s movie about mob operations in new jersey. when a "maverick" gangster doesn't play by the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later, it's time for elimination.joe pesci was true to his character -- smooth and funny. he only gets better with age. his face and present day fame should not have been used on the dvd cover to sell this "b" grade movie as he was only the third billed star.dated 1970's printed wide lapel shirts and lesser quality background music make for a distraction. nice to see the 1970's big cars. however, the acting is good. nakedness on the part of anne johns was not needed to make this mob story work. and, she does not show up in the database as every acting again in any film other than this one. too bad; she did a good job!moral of the story: don't get your "don" upset with you.if you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this dvd. it was part of a three-movie-on-one dvd $5.88 special at the local discount store.

not a bad mow. i was expecting another film based on womens issues but was pleasantly surprised at the element of suspense. sure, parts of the plot were pretty hokey but for the most part the movie kept me guessing. was the nut bar connected with the ex husband, somebody in the tavern or was it the guy (person) that she cut off? daniel magder was excellent. i've seen him in mom's on strike and in guilt by association, both mow's and he is very creditable, especially the way he challenges his mother the way a preteen would typically act.laura leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) that both men and women can relate to. she was frustrated enough to seem real.see it if you missed it. it's worthwhile.

pulling in 2.6 million viewers, one has to wonder what everyone's opinions on the storyline/plot is.reading the run down over at lifetime, i was led to believe that this would be an edge-of-your-seat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker. sadly i was mistaken. while the main plot is interesting enough - single mother run off road one night, then is stalked by same guy, the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth.laura leighton plays the victim, and she does it well. whether it was all those years on melrose place or not, she does well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm, and she's looking pretty good too these days.leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. i think many people will identify with the main character, after discovering why the stalker is stalking, it will be a view-only-once type of movie.

i agree with all the strenghts mentioned in the other reviews but there are some beats missing here that keep it firmly inside the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it from being a great drama beyond the limits of the "elements" that make up film noir--not to say that the great film noirs aren't/can't/shouldn't be also great dramas, but this one isn't.one other note the music in the film is used sparingly but i would say is used to accentuate the action more frequently than the wife elements.great set up to this film by the way with an abrupt sort of non ending ending that is either just right or a let down depends.spoilers follow as to some specifics.the big turn in the story involves the children seeing their mother die, or it should be the big moment. but the children are never shown to react one way or the other. neither cries, neither asks their father what happened, the kids are good actors and the reactions of the father are i suppose what matters but this is a big misstep. this is the heart of the story and the kids are kept mostly blank in their reaction. they really just have none, in the next scene they look as if nothing happened.in like fashion there is a bond that forms between belmondo and ventura's characters. belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed--but this is never explained and has no impact dramatically on belmondo or anyone else. the belmondo romantic subplot also strains credibility though it's convincingly acted. ventura's character just lets belmondo involve a total stranger in their escape plan for no reason. he doesn't even comment or seem to notice. another gap.the ending to the movie, and i won't spoil it, the ending happens off screen with a perfunctory voice over to tell you what happened. i guess this tries to make it feel more true to life, but again like these other missteps leaves drama off screen.what's the point of not dealing with these issues? i don't know, other than maybe the goals of the film were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melodrama--suggest some deeper elements, then move on to ignore them.too bad there is much to recommend this film, ventura is very very good, but too bad it could have been a great drama as well as a crime story--as with imdb favorite movie of all time the godfather. this film had potential. would make for a good remake though if done in the u.s. more problems would probably sink the film, but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remake,though it's doubtful ventura's performance could be topped.so worth seeing but frustrating as a whole

this is a black and white film from france,simple plot, gangster on the run seeking & getting help etc. we have seen this type film many times over the years. what makes this film different are mainly its acting & style. all the actors perform quietly,no one yells & hardly anyone loses his temper. there are quite a few deaths, some surprising. there are beautiful women as well, but no sex scenes. no car chases either.just talking/ it is so refreshing to listen to people talk, & here we must read subtitles as well.the acting is near perfect by all. especially the lead played by lino ventura & in a smaller but vital role jean paul belmondo. these 2 actors were among the best.i said above the film is flawed, there are a few script deficiencies in few spots, they are minor,the acting is the thing in this movie. production is first rate as well.ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)

classe tous risques (the big risk) is a french gangster movie that doesn't try for style. that's why it has style. because the movie is so underplayed and so matter-of-fact, it becomes more and more involving. and because abel davos is played by lino ventura, we wind up emotionally invested in this taciturn, tough killer who loves his wife and kids, has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near nice at night that neither he nor we expect, and who proves just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint. we first meet davos in italy with his wife and their two small boys, one about 9 and one 4. "this man was abel davos, sentenced to death in absentia," we're told. "on the run for years, he had watched his resources dwindle, even as his anxiety kept him on the move. with the italian police closing in each day, france was again his best bet. maybe he'd been forgotten." davos was a top gangster in paris who took care of his friends. that was several years ago. a heist to give him money to return to france goes very wrong. now he's hiding out with his two kids. he calls his friends in paris to help him out. he and his kids need to get from nice to paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up roadblocks. for davos' two best friends, time has passed and they've moved on. they don't want to put themselves at risk, and for what? obligation gives may to caution. so they hire a young thief, eric stark (jean- paul belmondo), to pick up davos and the children in an ambulance, then to drive to paris with davos heavily bandaged and the children hidden. we're on a journey where davos' options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to have his children cared for, where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship, where betrayal seems likely, and where quite possibly his only friend left is eric stark. this somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without fussing about. there are no trench coats with pulled-up collars, no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many french directors have loved. classe tous risques gives us abel davos, a man who once was somebody, who now is sliding down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation. lino ventura dominates the movie, yet when he is paired with jean-paul belmondo a curious chemistry happens. ventura as davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. he is humiliated by his situation. he is a tough man who sees killing someone, if needed, as just part of the business he's in. belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on, provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator. belmondo was 27 and looks younger. his unlikely star power as a lead actor -- broken nose, under-slung jaw -- shines right off the screen. he makes erik a match for ventura when they share a scene. and belmondo's scenes with liliane (sandra milo), the young woman who becomes his girl friend, radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal. the ending is bittersweet fate, and without a stylistic posture in sight. we hear davos say, "abel's gone. there's nothing left." it would be well worth watching classe tous risques to learn what he means. there are many fine french gangster films. i'd place this one right there with touchez pas au grisbi and bob le flambeur. to see one of lino ventura's finest performances, watch army of shadows.

i've only seen about a half dozen films starring lino ventura, but this one seems very much like the others. he plays a laconic criminal--one who is short on words and subdued yet occasionally explosive. given his quiet persona in such films as army of shadows and second breath, i've noticed that his minimalist style of acting is extremely effective. in other words, because he is so quiet and mannered, when he does bad things you tend to notice. and, like these other films, he also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code.abel davos (ventura) and his partner, lilane, are both living in italy and are career criminals. both grew up in france and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities. now in italy as the film begins, they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them. oddly, instead of running to yet a third country, they decide to go back to france--even though davos has been tried and convicted in absentia--and if he's caught it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty. much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return.unfortunately for davos, the return doesn't go perfectly and now it seems as if every cop in france is looking for him. additionally, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he'd expect. in fact, their tepid response to his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film.along the way, davos meets and is taken in my a stranger, eric stark (jean-paul belmondo). despite davos seemingly having no friends, stark and his lady friend try their best to make his return successful. what throws another monkey wrench into this, though, is davos' two very young sons--what is davos to do with them--keep them with him in his hiding place? overall, this is a very good crime film--sort of like french film noir. unlike american noir, the many french versions i have seen have a more realistic as well as bleak outlook to them. fatalism reigns supreme, that's for sure! the acting is first-rate (especially from ventura and belmondo), the direction very sure and the writing very nice, though i am sure many won't like the ending. it just seems to be tacked on--like an afterthought. i understood why they did it this way, but can also see how it might leave many unsatisfied. as for me, it did leave me a tad flat. otherwise, an exceptional film.

if you get the slight enjoyment out of pink floyd's music you will love this movie. the score is completely pink floyd and of course the drug element plays a major part in this movie giving you the doubts about life within the weakest moments. this movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you ... there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island.this thing tell me i need ten lines to sum up a movie but i am done that is all you get that is why this movie is a 6.1 which is a major upset to any movie with a score like this. take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain .... equally good scores for our generation but overestimated

i have become a big fan of the work of barbet schroeder, so maybe i am already a little biased by now, but i think this movie is great, although there may be a few lengths. it is a romantic unromantic view of the great liberation in the later sixties, stylistically amazingly polished (great set design!) and in my opinion still very watchable.basically this is an ironic re-telling of the story of adam and eve who are driven from paradise after having tasted the ¬Ñforbidden fruit" which has turned from an apple into a hypodermic filled with heroine. the woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom. i say accelerating as the guy seems to be doomed and bound for an intensive life and an early grave right from the great title sequence onwards. there is no place for any hope.although the story is rather sad, i was captured by the beauty both of the beautiful location ibiza and mimsy farmer. i found her character was at once shallow, enigmatic, endearing, annoying, interesting and boring. somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic, unoffensive way. architecture and built artifacts in general are put to very good use ¬ñ which seems to be a schroeder trademark of sorts.there is even some humor, mainly delivered by stefan, the german main character and his accent. his main nemesis is not a snake but an older german of dubious reputation ¬ñ and provider of the heroine - called wolf. although it is a german name and stefan is german, he pronounces it verrry english and in fits of jealousy spits the name out at his girlfriend in regular intervals ¬ñ becoming a boy who cries ... at times stefan has to work in order to earn a ¬Ñcellery". at one time the guy goes snorkeling and afterward awkwardly clambers up a rock with his rubber flippers ¬ñ never has male frontal nudity been funnier in movie history.

17/02/09 "more" (1969) dir: barbet schroeder for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, i'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. i've only scoured the web quite briefly and i've already been informed that "more" is: a 19th century-style romance, an allusion to the story of icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to pink floyd completists. it's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that "more" is anything but a pretty average film.neither is it a masterpiece, of course. i approached "more" as i did "easy rider" and antonioni's "blowup" - as a 'time-capsule' film, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. they all have similar flaws - either vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way - they are what they are, man. this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. thankfully, "more" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it.stefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany. the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bars before meeting estelle. the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza, against the advice of his friend charlie. this is where the icarus thing comes into play - she is the sun, he is pursuing her. you may now be able to guess how this all ends.ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the over-populated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. i can't think of many other films that have done this.the relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings. for a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. but stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibiza.pink floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of "more". it is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the soundtrack album's front cover). a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple - they cannot 'land' without a crash. maybe they've come too close to what they wanted.stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris. we are left to presume they have no idea where he is. while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears.

it's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay & bi-sexual relationships, and their struggles! "pool days" is about the awkwardness of adolescence, and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one. a story about experience and vulnerability!"a friend of dorothy" portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some point in their life: the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual. sensitively examined, this story truly left me feeling moved!"the disco years" shows another version of a no-win situation: getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation, but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight! a very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person! while these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual or searching. each story is uplifting in its own unique way!

the trio are a pleasant, nostalgic journey to that first hint of desire--when it was still about simple exploration of the unknown--before we "grew up" and added those complexities of hiv status, emotional baggage and gotta-run-my-pager-just-went-off into the emotional mix.the angst portrayed is pure adolescent angst, but it rings true in all three stories. their sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. and those kinds of films are few and far between.good news! both boys life and boys life 2 are now readily available on dvd as of september 1999.

these three directors are off to good beginnings. the three stories are remarkably well-done for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of "coming out" when you aren't really sure it's a good idea. i laughed at those veiled glances around the dressing room in "pool days"; i smiled at the notion that fans of bette midler, judy garland, and barbra streisand are assumed to be gay in "a friend of dorothy"(ie. browsing through the cd music racks); and i cringed over the "jock" in "the disco years" whose memory of sweet sex was now "blurred" by liquor. it all seemed so real. i look forward to more offerings from this trio of directors.

i gave 9 of 10 points. i was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie, because i had to laugh!the story of course wasn't excellent, but it also wasn't boring. erkan & stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful nina. while doing this job they come between the "front-lines" of bnd and cia. of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen, so they run from one disaster into another; and they do this in such a funny way, that when you watch some scenes you won't be able to stop the tears! as actors those two "dumbly grinning" characters do quite well, better than some so called professional.you think, the speech of the two heroes is curios or "pseudo-foreign"? well, if you hear quite a lot turkish-german people in munich speaking exactly like them, you will remember erkan & stefan. and maybe, in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth. (god forbid!)so, if you like to laugh, watch this movie!

first of all, i am from munich, where this movie takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like erkan and stefan, including the silly dialect! i know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was, that the movie is just an assembling of their already known jokes, but it is not! the jokes are evolved through the story, and make, in their own special way, sense. but if you absolutely dislike erkan und stefan, hands of this movie. everyone else - it's worth viewing!

great movie. i was laughing all time through. why? well, i am from austria, i can get along with the german (bavarian) kind of humor. so i guess this movie makes only sense watching when you are german native speaker. stefan and erkan both are talking in a new kind of turkish-german accent, which became really popular in our countries (ger & aut). but of course they are very stupid. as in every comedy your personal humor will decide, whether thumb up or down.

those two main characters erkan and stefan are a munich comedy act. i was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing. but when i saw this movie i was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it.all in all very amusing and not a common german movie.

i enjoyed erkan & stefan ¬ñ a cool and fast story which didn't get bogged down in detail. those two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. the high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot.erkan & stefan show that the german film industry is capable of transferring successful hollywood concepts with local `satire' into our cinemas.

i was looking in the tv guide for movies that come from germany and i found one called the bunnyguards, so i watched it and i laughed myself silly! i wanted the dvd but its not available here (i could order it from germany but it doesn't have subtitles) it was played again so i taped it and watch it from time to time.anyway, i looked for info on it and found out its real name is erkan & stefan, but i know it by its australian title: the bunnyguards.some people who i know from germany do not like erkan & stefan because of their accents, but not being german myself, i didn't notice anything. the jokes are good, but some germans might find their accents off-putting.i think this movie is funny and if the dvd had english subtitles on all the extras (having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad) i would buy it up in a snap!i recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.

aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest marguerite moreau.i would have loved to see this movie play out as akasha's power trip. aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen. she does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.lena olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is hugely unjustified. she looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the imdb) still looks stunning.the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.the most heart wrenching is akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to aaliyah after filming.all in all, a remarkable vampire movie.

i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health. it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire, i get the feeling that she writes really good novels. the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.still, stuart townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that queen of the damned's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline. while interview decided to go with lace and elegance, queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. the costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.however, i'll give credit where credit is due. the soundtrack is excellent. korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead.the film opens with a very cool goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice. what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. unfortunately, queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress. where are the yellow contacts? where's the pale blue make-up? scene after scene, i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right.there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. props to aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. she might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. did i mention that the soundtrack was good? let's see, what else can i say? it wasn't too long. the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it. there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything.jyjimboduck-dot-com

quite good, don't expect anything high culture.......the acting is bad, the storyline fails, but it is still a fairly nice movie to watch. why? because it's dark, a little bit stupid, like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch. do not expect anything, like i said, just see it for yourself and you know what i mean.it is a movie, without a plot or memorable acting, but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh, cry or at least make you feel compelled to watch it to the end...this is all i wanted to say....7 / 10

in queen of the damned,akasha(aaliyah) was more sexy and had a bigger,demanding presence, she just caught your eye and attention. now the movie did have faults, like the lack of explaining akasha's past. what i also did not like was the that the movie didn't really explain or show more of what the relationship between lestat and akasha was/ or was like.akasha's (aaliyah's) role was sort of limited in the movie and she didn't appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off, her(akasha's) death came 2 quickly.but i liked how akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her, because in the book the last fight between akasha and the ancients was rather boring (they killed akasha in like 2 secs).akasha's head got knocked off in 1 sec and lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world.aaliyah played akasha very well and stuart was perfect as lestat, they could not have picked a better akasha or lestat. "rest in peace aaliyah"

this show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors (like the girl from boston legal and boris the butcher from snatch). even the extras and the kid, whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link, surprised me with his skill. it's just the little things that the director needs to tweak. like the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired. having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story. the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things, but no where near as long as some shows like prison break. anyone know when they will resume the season??

i am new at this, so bear with me please. i am a big fan of surface. i thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any sci fi flick i've seen at the theater. in february the tv guide said season finale, the announcer for the show said something to the effect of, "...and now for the season finale of surface." season finale, not series finale! i couldn't wait for fall to get here, to see was going to happen next. so fall gets here and it's nowhere to be found! if nbc isn't going to pick it up, what about sci fi or usa? it seems to me that bay watch didn't last long on abc & then usa picked it up, and it went gang busters! (i bet abc was chocking) ha! if not a series, then at least a mini series, to give all us loyal fans closure. what happened to our guy's trapped in the church steeple? was the creature in the chaple nim? did he have a grouth spert? does the cloned guy come over to our side? there are so many unanswered questions. thank's for listening to me babble!

i would like if they brought back surface. i really enjoyed the show along with my family. i felt the plot development and storyline were first rate. like the other person said, it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common denominator. nothing but bland, politically correct junk survives. just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show. also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show. this is the same thing that happened to the time travel show i think was called 8 days but should have been called backstep. did the olympics kill surface? i know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest american hero.

when i started watching "surface"for the first time i was hooked.it had everything i wanted in a show suspense,action,mystery,great plot,and a great cast of characters.my whole family loved to watch the show.it seems when there's a great show on tv the network usually cancels it like they seemed to do with this show.they go by the nielson rating system which i think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that they seem to watch which the networks keep on the air.if only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show then maybe the good shows won't get canceled.when i watch tv now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of tv.i hope that the network brings the show back but when they make up there mind with a dumb decision they seem to stick to it.i hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way.

i enjoy the show surface very much. the show is very entertaining and it's a clean show. a show like surface is interesting. it keeps my attention. it has compassion and suspense. i love all the cast members that are on the show. they are all very good choices. i think it is very important to have the right cast of any show because thats what makes any show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself. television has changed so much over the years. it has changed in good ways and in bad. i love to watch some comedy,action, suspense and romance. and scifi. but surface is a show that i hope comes back for many seasons because it is a great show and its something that families can watch. my children are grown, but my husband and i enjoy watching these types of shows. i appreciate your time and letting me comment my opinion. thanks.paulette blackwell

i don't believe it sixty percent of voters voted this show as ten now how the hell is the rating a five point eight it impossible i don't get it, its totally pathetic i mean how. anyway the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely a ten out of ten from me i think the creatures are cool they look great and i wish i had a nimrod great show great cgi hope there's a second series as a lot went unanswered in the first season and when is nimrod gonna get any bigger as the rest of the creatures are huge, again why is the rating so low when the votes were so high 10/10

someone asked why it was canceled i tell you why because "reality" makes money. the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" show, this will haunt nbc, i and about half of my high school, about 1000 people total have vowed to boycott nbc, until they bring this show back. in my area (i don't know about other places) but they had a great thing going with the sci-fi channel where the sci-fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7:00 and then nbc would show the week's new episode at 8:00 this was great because it gave you a little refresher as to what happened in the last episode. i was so angry when i learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that!

in the changing world of cg and what-not of cartoon animations etc. etc., faeries was a warm welcome at least by me. i think it's important to show these sort of films once in a while, to preserve them and help remind us of where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from. people were talking about how it is boring because of the graphics and stuff but hey! think about the films that will be considered boring if every film looked like the new state of the art ones everybody and their mother is making these days. call me old-fashioned but i liked it. it's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all it really needs from its audience is their imagination.

i think that this is a fabulous movie... i watched it constantly from the time i was 4 to about the time i was 8... however, watching it resulted in many nightmares. i particularly got them because of the guy that was always like "the otherworld" and his friends. i am 12, and i still get nightmares about it to this day. i can't fall asleep right now because i am thinking about it. i love this movie, but it is so scary! i definitely love this movie though, i have very good memories from it. kate is very good at acting in this movie. amazingly, i never realized that it was her! i also think that the graphics were very high quality, contrary to what some other people think

basically an endearingly chintzy and moronic $1.50 version of the nifty early 80's subterranean creature feature favorite "the boogens," this entertainingly schlocky cheapie centers on a nasty, squirmy, wriggling monster who makes an instant meal out of any unfortunate souls foolhardy enough to go poking around the notoriously off limits gold spike mine. your standard-issue motley assortment of intrepid boneheads -- hectoring hard-nosed mine boss, cute, but insipid blonde babe, feisty lady geologist, boozy, inexplicably aussie-accented (!) seasoned old mine hand, charmless doofus, hunky, jolly guy, and, arguably the most annoying character of the uniformly irritating bunch, a nerdy bespectacled aspiring writer dweeb who's prone to speaking in flowery, melodramatic utterances -- trek into the dark, uninviting cave in search of gold. naturally, these intensely insufferable imbeciles discover that the allegedly abandoned mine is the home of a deadly, ugly, multi-tentacled beast who in time honored hoary b-flick fashion proceeds to gruesomely bag the group one at a time. directed, co-written, co-produced and co-edited with dumbfounding maladroitness by melanie anne phillips, acted with dismaying flatness by a rank no-name cast, further marred by lethargic pacing, a drably meandering narrative, murky, under-lit, eye-straining cinematography, a shivery, redundantly thudding pseudo-john carpenter synthesizer score, and a cruddy, herky-jerky stop motion animation wormoid thingie that's only quickly glimpsed at the very end of the movie, this extremely clunky, amateurish and hence quite delectably dreadful would-be scarefest commits all the necessary bad film missteps to qualify as a real four-star stinkeroonie.

early 80's creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out. naturally, they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that slithers along in search of prey.while i have to be honest and admit i found it dull at first (i personally prefer the thematically similar "the boogens"), it actually grew on me as it went along. now, the characters aren't too interesting nor the actors either. the closest to an interesting character is morgan, played by keith hurt. in any event, female lead terri berland is quite good looking and rolf theison makes his domineering jerk an easy person to hate. the writer played by effects man mark sawicki wears thin quickly.it begins in a comfortably predictable enough way, with a nighttime set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start. the monster itself is intriguing for its design (as you can imagine, it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game) and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much. director melanie anne phillips (directing under the pseudonym of david michael hillman) and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere. they manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. the film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending. suffice it to say, they do the best they can on their low budget.an obscure little item worth looking into for die-hard horror buffs.7/10

i was completely drawn into the story, but i wonder if perhaps i shouldn't have been so sympathetic to the hurt character's plight for respect. because when it boils down, i really think that glam reporters such as barbara walters is the devil. ...or maybe the filmmakers were telling us that we're all unknowing supporters of fluff news stories.

or maybe not. whatever anyone thinks of "broadcast news," good or bad, almost all the credit for that "thinking" belongs to writer-producer-director james l. brooks. as a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case, the "business" being television news -- but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. to do all that takes real talent, something mr. j. brooks has in abundance.one user on this website, in his summary, asked the musical question -- "did walter cronkite act like this?" answerve: no! of course not! and the reason for that is in walter's -- uh, mr. cronkite's -- day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. same goes for john chancellor and chet and david and douglas edwards and howard k. smith. sure, they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. but all they really cared about was the news itself.now, of course, all that has changed. for the last 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that has really mattered is ratings, ratings, ratings. the bottom line. how many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? don't believe that?let's consider "the big three": tom brokaw, dan rather and peter jennings (aka "stanley stunning"). all three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years (peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). of the three, dan is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter. personally, i think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions. all of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually in those jobs. all three are now in their 60's (dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. and if you think they're still good looking now, imagine how good looking they were in their 40's, when all three were hired for (let's say, "put in") their current jobs. but do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been "put in" had he looked like, let's say, fred gwynne ("herman munster"). or like -- heaven forfend -- me!!! not only that, if dan were retiring tomorrow, a younger (than he is today) walter cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. why? not pretty enough. and it would matter not a whit that he is, or once was, "the most trusted man in america." and this is what "broadcast news" is all about. tom grunnick (william hurt), the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and knowing stuff. jane craig (holly hunter), the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics, all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-tom. and aaron altman (albert brooks, no relation to james l.), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he "flop-sweats" behind the anchor desk. and many other such flawed characters whom you know really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks."network" blazed the trail. eleven years later, "broadcast news" carried the torch as a worthy successor. in the new millennium, what will be the next movie to savage the business of network "news you can use" ..... maybe. or maybe not.

spoiler alert i have never seen comments on a movie, that i disagree with more then the comments people made on this. one could learn from critical viewings of this movie. as an educational film, i rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! we do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. as entertainment, i rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. this conflict results in my eight star rating. the movie follows jane craig (holly hunter), a television news producer. the network executive introduces tom grunnick (william hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. tom immediately charms people with humbleness. another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, aaron altman (albert brooks). altman knows all news stories, inside and out.the network executive wants grunnick on the air and jane argues, saying grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. they do not listen to her. forced to place grunnick on the air, jane contacts altman to get information on the news story and relays altman's comments through an earpiece to grunnick while grunnick speaks. we watch the sharp contrast between altman's/jane craig's words and grunnick's, as grunnick skillfully rewords everything altman and jane craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from grunnick, the new guy. this new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? this is something altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly. grunnick coaches altman and gets excited noting hundreds of altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. the complexity of understanding what grunnick taught him, causes altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("flop sweat") when he is on the air. grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and altman resigns prior to being fired. but grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig, because she finds out from altman, that grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. this turns her off of him. this sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them. this movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in broadcast news. there are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of tv news and how grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. the opposite is true, grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (he coaches altman to punch a word in every sentence). grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with jane craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. many people are calling altman very intelligent or brilliant. altman played by brookes is not as intelligent as grunnick and the "flop sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that grunnick handles when on the air. altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. there are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the tv news industry. the concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. as an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.

this movie has everything going for it: fully developed characters, a realistic portrayal of working washington, bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely albert brooks. the dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987. remember, this was pre-cable! so satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed. such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance. see if you can spot john cusack as the angry messenger! and do you recognize peter hackes from real life broadcast news? finally, if you're from dc, see if you agree with holly hunter's directions to cab drivers!

i loved this movie the first time i saw it. it gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably jane craig rushing kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then joan cusack struggling to get it in, and william hurt, who according to jane commits an incredible breach of ethics, fakes his tears during his date rape interview, a flaw that is pointed out by aaron. another high point is when tom uses jane for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with jennifer. the script is brilliant, and the directing is almost as good. all three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, especially holly hunter, and albert brooks, whom is the funniest in the film. william hurt is also very good. this deserved at least three oscars, best actress(holly hunter), best supporting actor (albert brooks), and best picture. i liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later.8/10

a truly terrific, touching film. female melodrama at its finest, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic: you're in love with "mr. right" but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head-over-heels in love. but of course, it's not that simplistic. the characters are real and all of the performances are perfect. the movie is hilarious as well, every scene skewers society. i'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-written screenplay of humor and melodrama. you can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. a great, underrated movie.

movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorablescenes to be considered truly great. broadcast news doesn't havethree, it has twice that. this movie is extremely well written byjames brooks. holly hunter and albert brooks have never beenbetter. i love this movie for many reasons. it is great because itmakes you laugh and it makes you cry. albert brooks has severalgreat lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1(laughed) "i cansing and read, i am singing while i read," with midnight train togeorgia playing in the background. # 2(laughed) telling thewilliam hurt character that "you really blew the lid off of nookie,"after watching hurt's report on date-rape. #3 (cried) when aaron(a. brooks) finally tells jayne (hunter) that he loves her and shecan't end up with hurt's character because he representseverything about journalism jayne finds dispicable. finally, #4 (laughed) who can forget the scene where aaronanchors the weekend news....hilarious. this movie should have won an oscar! it has everything i love inmovies, great acting, intelligent script, and even a jack nicholsoncameo!

typically, i'm a comedy guy. i rented this at the video store under comedy, and thought "albert brooks! awesome!" and rented it. it seemed like the romantic comedy, and i remembered i hated those, and had the full mindset of hating this movie.boy, was i wrong.while this is a romantic comedy, it's acted by an amazing lead & supporting cast (brooks, hunter, cusack, and nicholson), and everything works well within itself. the script sounds real and not forced, like this could be happening in the news station you're watching at night. it takes your emotions and makes you enjoy hunter and brooks and loathe hurt, which makes the ending a bit unenjoyable and fruitless, but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie, you just need a truthful ending, which is what everyone got. not everybody's life ends well, and it shows in broadcast news. maybe people don't like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies... but it works, it's real, and it's genius. broadcast news is a classic in it's time, and a fine romance movie up there with "casablanca". well, maybe not that high, but it's the only other romance i can think of that i like.broadcast news: 9/10.

i didn't like "as good as it gets" very much, but i am a big fan of william hurt and holly hunter's work, so i decided to watch this movie. and the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of albert brooks. here, in spain, he's little-known, and only as a 2nd division version of woody allen in the west coast. he played a great part, but hunter and hurt were good too, specially hurt, in an relatively unusual role for him. hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in "once around" (lasse hallstrom, 1991).finally, the rest of the cast is great, too. robert prosky, one of these familiar faces of the american cinema, the ex-bond girl lois chiles, pretty good placed on that role, i think, the always perfect joan cusack in her early years; and specially the brief appereance of jack nicholson. maybe he doesn't have any good scene, but it's jack nicholson, anyway... the best movie by james l.brooks, great story (well resolved), and superb cast for one of the, surely, best movies of the 80's

i haven't actually seen a lot of movies with holly hunter, but seeing her in broadcast news was a pleasant surprise. she is a hard-nosed journalist, jane craig, who has devoted all of her time to tv news show. her colleague aaron altman has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything. the love triangle is completed by tom grunnick. he is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter. to jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business. much to her surprise, jane finds herself attracted to tom.holly hunter is doing a great performance as the perky journalist. but i don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, tom. it's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. almost as impressive is albert brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return. actually, for a while i thought he was steve guttenberg from police academy (1984). he has a few funny lines and if this was a meg ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg. jane's and aaron's trip to central america. also, i'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.

not only do i think this was the best film of 1987, it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films i've ever seen. for whatever reason, i really connected with this movie, and it is one of the most personal films i had seen at that point in my life (i was 26). for better or worse, i strongly identified with the holly hunter character (and i'm a guy!). she plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who couldn't figure out romantic relationships. there were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that i would say or have said to others in similar circumstances. and the ending of the movie i find to be so very, very sad.obviously, this role was the big break for holly hunter. clearly, i was not the only one to think so highly of it.

this is a love story set against the back drop of television news. the three main stars, william hurt,holly hunter and albert brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the washington bureau of a tv network.tom grunick(hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.jane (hunter)is the producer who recognises that tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.aaron altman(brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.holly hunter was nominated for a best actress academy award ,but lost out to cher(moonstruck!).she was robbed! this is hunter's film.her character jane is smart,ruthless and totally driven. she is also hilariously neurotic. her performance is perfect.just watch her face when she watches the tape of tom's interview of a rape victim. the scales literally fall from her eyes.wiliam hurt's performance is less showy.he plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like jane.he gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating.the film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. it predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.think about this:this film was released before the end of the cold war and before rise of reality tv.yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.paris hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story! to see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.tom grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!

i thought it was terrific! very realistic and funny dialogue, and realistic action in a newsroom. i didn't like how the jennifer storyline is not really concluded or how the ending doesn't give us closure. holly hunter fit the part perfectly...she's one crazy actress. this movie is well worth seeing.

tv news producer, jane craig (hunter) meets tom grunick (hurt), an up-and-coming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that tom is, in his own words, "no good at what i'm being a success at", and jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where tv news is going. the rub comes when tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in washington.jane and tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but will jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to - and should she? aaron altman (brooks) is jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante. despite his obvious talent, aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills - and the classic good looks - to be the success that his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - tom - is becoming. he is also concerned that his good friend jane maybe falling in love with tom, despite her better judgement, as it becomes increasingly clear that aaron has his own romantic feelings for her.this central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a tv news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important.this is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comment and scenes. one of many moments is a scene where tom meets the network's top anchorman, bill rorich (a cameo role for jack nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. in a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands.the dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance. brooks gets the best portion of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over-heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room, should be listened to.hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was rightly (and not alone) nominated for an oscar, and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-com.brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too-smug-for-his-own-good, aaron altman.hurt, whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character, does not always convince that he is quite as dim-witted the character says he is or is supposed to be. he displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but i don't think hurt quite pulls it off. apart from when he tells us he "stinks" or "doesn't get it", hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that. otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations, but brooks and hunter slightly overshadow hurt's performance. it is the only negative thing i can say about the whole film, and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better, or come off any better, when next to hunter and brooks and their performances in this movie.support is ably provided by, amongst others, robert prosky, lois chiles and joan cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for christian clemenson of subsequent boston legal fame, and the briefest of bit-parts for joan's brother, john cusack, whose face you don't even see.james l brooks has provided us with many great tv shows and movies, and this film should rank up there with the very best of them. it may not have won any oscars, despite seven nominations, but it did win plenty of other awards, and turned holly hunter into a star.

i don't really know when it was that tv stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters - regardless of the mens' iqs - but it was clearly a problem by the time that "broadcast news" came out, and the movie does a really good job looking at it. portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air-head reporter tom grunick (william hurt), intelligent but nervous reporter aaron altman (albert brooks) and producer jane craig (holly hunter), the movie pulls no punches. probably the best line in the movie is when tom says something like: "i don't really understand any of what i'm reporting." and in the era of fox news and such things, a movie like this becomes even more important.all in all, definitely a movie that i recommend. also starring robert prosky, lois chiles, joan cusack, and jack nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman.

if you have not seen this late 80s film about the the washington bureau of a network news station than i highly recommend it. it is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with wit. the characters are well developed and albert brooks performance is fabulous. he delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy. i am not an albert brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise. i have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research.fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of network news. it is not nearly as dark as another movie i also recommend in the same genre 'network'.

...there was "broadcast news," and what a good thing it was. this one just plain stands up and sounds its barbaric yawp in a manner that resonates two decades later.there are moments -- especially with respect to the cutesy score -- when this film becomes a bit too eighties, or a bit too "sleepless in seattle." fortunately, they're few and far between.one-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three flawed but endearing people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny. holly hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role. (and yes, i'm including "raising arizona," her other star turn from that era, in this assessment.)a legitimate classic.

good drama/comedy, with two good performances from hunter & hurt, but albert brooks steals every scene he is in. with a great script, this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent. and although joan cusack is not in this much, but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie. the highlight of the movie for me, was albert brooks speech on the devil. only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places. and i only got totally interested in brooks role, not so much in hunter's or hurt's. i give this a 7 out of 10.

broadcast news {dir. james l. brooks, 1987} ****/**** although it lacks the emotional punch of brooks's debut feature, (terms of endearment) broadcast news is a superlative film, with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well-researched as a hard-hitting news report. let it be known, this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second. in my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. the film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension , while the satire remains sly and never bitter. comparisons to network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes. while also a great film, network is a cynical and weary work; in other words, its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television. network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. in contrast, the characters populating the news rooms of broadcast news love and live for their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives.) they derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting, just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.

"zen and the art of lanscaping", written and directed by david kartch is a short film about a young man named david (his friends call him zen) and what transpires in one strange day of his life. zen works as a lanscaper for an upper-middle class family. the lady of the house tries to get zen to help her cheat on her husband. unfortunately, her son walks in on them instead of her husband. from this point on the movie starts to speed through many revelations between the characters along with the eventual involvement of the man of the house. "zen and the art of landscaping" is witty, smart and overall very well written. the comedic timing of the actors is also very strong. it's a fun, light movie that i would strongly recommend.

screening as part of a series of funny shorts at the sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival, this film was definitely a highlight. the script is great and the direction and acting was terrific. as another posting said, the actors' comedic timing really made this film. lots of fun.

when jean seduces the young gardener for the sole purpose of annoying her husband little does she realise the explosive drama that is to follow.the short scenario does not waste a word or a frame in this brief interlude in the day of a dysfunctional family. the lives of the father, mother and son are all linked in some way with the gardener. it's this fact that makes the script so intriguing.for such a short film the production is every bit as professional as any major work and the casting is ideal.a wonderful little film that can guarantee a few laughs from beginning to end.

great little short film that aired a while ago on sbs here in aus. get a copy if you can - probably only good for a few viewings, as you'll end up remembering the script - and it's the twists that make this film so funny. well directed, and intriguingly scripted, it's an example of just how good low-budget short films can be.

you gotta love the spaghetti western universe. the vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning, cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme close-ups, and the anti-hero walks away from the girl in the end. a lot of people call corbucci's films 'depressing'. i find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go. i think bleak and unforgiving are more apt mostly because 'depressing' suggests a level of sentimentality almost every eurowestern director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad strokes.gli specialisti must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the sergio corbucci canon. it's a beautiful movie. and it makes sense that corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with companeros after the unremitting one two punch of the great silence and this (although he would later revert back to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed sonny and jed). there's still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall grimness of the movie, imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble. and it hurts to have mario adorf playing mexican one-handed bandit el diablo as over the top as he always plays his characters.those minor gripes aside there's more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado. shootouts galore, the population of an entire town reduced to crawling naked in the dirt, the typical iconic badassitude of the laconic antihero (played by johnny halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the movie. corbucci might never receive the acclaim of the more famous sergio or the american patriarchs of the genre but you and i know that's a gross injustice for a very talented director. his dynamic shot selection, in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and receding in the background, his flair for quick pacing and feverish energy in moving a story that wasn't always all that along, the way he photographs open spaces, everything in his work makes me sure that if corbucci was american and had emerged 15 years later along with mann and hawks, the cahiers du cinema critics would have lauded him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration.

cult film-maker corbucci's rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns (of which i'm only left with what am i doing in the middle of the revolution [1972] to catch) is one i only became aware of fairly recently via marco giusti's "stracult" guide; it's an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece, the great silence (1968), complete with desolate snowy landscapes.johnny hallyday, the french elvis presley, whom i first saw in jean-luc godard's detective (1985) is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti-hero hud (who, like clint eastwood's the man with no name from sergio leone's celebrated "dollars trilogy", is fitted with a steel-plate armor for protection); incidentally, i had 'met' hallyday's stunning daughter laura smet at the 2004 venice film festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director, claude chabrol! gastone moschin is another curious addition to the fold (serving pretty much the same function that frank wolff did in the great silence) but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing francoise fabian; the latter, then, plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals. sylvie fennec has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by hallyday and who, at one point, is entreated into free love by 'hippie' apache gabriella tavernese (with this is mind, it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both fabian and tavernese)! incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youths (who also engage in dope-smoking and revolutionary talk) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary relevance ¬ñ but it all eventually adds to the fun (besides, even the black barmaid sports an afro hairdo!).mario adorf, too, enjoys himself tremendously with the smallish role of a larger-than-life mexican bandit nicknamed "el diablo" ¬ñ who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side (an element which may have influenced clint eastwood's unforgiven [1992]) and, at one point, challenges the captive moschin to a head-butting duel! having mentioned this, the film also contains one very unusual 'weapon of death' ¬ñ as hallyday disposes of an adversary by kicking the cash-register of the saloon into his face! as always, the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by over-emphatic sound effects; equally typically for the genre, however, the wistful score by angelo francesco lavagnino emerges a most significant asset. actually, the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film's generally somber tone ¬ñ after fabian's comeuppance at the hands of the locals, the hippies (who had previously idolized hud) suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town (forcing everyone on the street and unclothed)¬Öbut the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge (they, however, scurry away at the prospect of facing him!) and then rides out of town, leaving fennec behind.in conclusion, i acquired this via a good-quality widescreen print in italian albeit with french credits and the occasional lapse ¬ñ about one minute of screen-time in all ¬ñ into the french language (where, apparently, the original soundtrack wasn't available).

in the late sixties director sergio corbucci made four spaghetti westerns in a row--the classics the mercenary, the great silence, the specialists, and companeros. three of these, all except the specialists, are constantly turning up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are rated. until recently all i had seen was a very poor quality compilation with some english, some italian, a fuzzy picture, and it was nearly incomprehensible. now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages, however), i can safely include the specialists in that group of four classics. johnny halliday is very good as the charismatic hud, a notorious hand with the gun returning to blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was lynched by the townspeople for losing their savings. it involves a voluptuous beauty who owns the bank, a mexican bandit leader, el diablo, who was once friends with hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days, and a small band of hippies--well, it was the late sixties, and hippies were everywhere, even apparently in our westerns. it's not a desert western, shot in the alps somewhere, and is lovely to look at. there is a bit more nudity than i expect in a western, but that's not a bad thing. sylvie fennec is lovely as sheba, who may be hud's niece, or dead brother's girlfriend...that's never made clear. this film deserves to be seen, and once again, we plea for a nice dvd with all the trimmings--i think the specialists would be as well known as any of corbucci's other westerns, and that's high praise indeed.

the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good. it's grainy and has almost no color in some parts. it switches back and forth between english and french, often in mid sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! to make matters much worse, there are no english subtitles during the french language parts, which i think make up at least one quarter of the film. but, amazingly, the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this condition, and i think that says a lot about how well-made this film is.this is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting, an interesting storyline, and an excellent music score. it also has a cool protagonist, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and an overall feeling of melancholy. this film has "euro" written all over it.i hope there is a pristine negative or print of this film out there somewhere, because it deserves a quality dvd release, and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it!

the whole town of blackstone is afraid, because they lynched bret dixon's brother - and he is coming back for revenge! at least that's what they think.a great johnny hallyday and a very interesting, early mario adorf star in this italo-western, obviously filmed in the alps.bret dixon is coming back to blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched. he is a loner and gunslinger par excellance, everybody is afraid of him - the mexican bandits (fighting the gringos that took their land!) as well as the "decent" citizens that lynched bret's brother. they lynched him, because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to dallas to the safety of the bank there. but this is is only half the truth, as we find out in the course of this psychologically interesting western.but beware, it's kind of a depressing movie as everybody turns out to be guilty somehow and definitely everybody is bad to the bone...still, i enjoyed it very much and gave it an 8/10. strange, that only less than 5 people voted for this movie as of january 12th 2002....

loved the story of a guy that tries to get his girl back....been there, done that, so i can relate...any way, i love the camera work, how occasionally the camera gets "left on", and they are just sitting there talking about the scene, or other stuff...or how the camera follows him around to find the cast and what not...i watched this on ifc sometime last year and i loved it, so i told a few of my friends about it, and some of them watched it, and they too loved it...check it out if you can, kinda girly, but its still a good film...i gave it a 10/10 because of two reasons...one: i can relate...but anyone that has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate... two: its a really creative way to make a film, its like you are constantly there, right in the middle of filming...like i said, great film

this is an enjoyable project, that is not a film as the title suggests. good performance by nadia dajani who re-enacts the role of grace. i follows the re-enactment of what happens to mike and grace in new york city. she leaves, but he wants to get in contact with her. this project is his way of trying to getting in touch with her.i saw it on ifc. i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well. i do like this trend of more independent projects. this is an example of a good project.i hope that he finds her.take a look and be entertained.kirbyef

most movies from hollywood seem to follow one of a few pre-formulated and very predictable plots. this film does not and is a perfect example of what i watch ifc for.there's a guy, michael, and his girlfriend left him with out a word. he wants to know what happened. is she ok ? can he say goodbye ? perhaps get some closure. he hasn't been able to contact grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your help.michael figures we might need a reason to help him, so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend ( nadia ) to play the role of grace ( the girlfriend who left) hind sight is 20/20 and it is no different for michael. by telling his story, and getting feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost. this is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn ( or need to learn ) and is easy to identify with. that is what makes you want to hear more of michael's story and wanting to know if he finds grace.

it is clear this film's value far supersedes the cost with which the format (mini-dv) implies. in fact, the filmmaker embraces the format and incorporates it so craftily into the storyline that i forgot the fact that i was not seeing the typical 35 millimeter film. it has the core appeal of indie movies like clerks & the work of robert rodriguez combined with a fantastic "new take" on the romantic comedy genre. "this is not a film" is an honest film with honest portrayals and, it is a superbly paced narrative. there is not one point in this film where i felt a scene could have (or should have) been omitted. on the contrary, the director pulls amazing performances out of truly gifted actors and does so in extremely confining circumstances. from page to screen, this film is a worthy and relevant story that hits on so many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). i highly recommend it for all who enjoy cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise devoid of charm medium.

'this is not a film' works because it is so true in what it is trying to say. if you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message, you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character, michael. whether male or female, all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship. did it really occur like we remembered? what went wrong? michael's desire to find grace is completely selfish. more than anything, he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out. but even so, he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. we would not be in them otherwise. as the film ends, i am not sure if michael has learned anything new about himself or not. our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend, nadia. she is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story. i found michael to be pompous, arrogant, and just plain clueless. which is exactly why i liked him. he is a real character. if you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then this is a film for you. in closing, it is a film for everyone.

i don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but, this mimics life's reality in so many ways, and, if you are really honest with yourself, you will resonate with it in agreement in at least a few of the scenes.the acting is not only believable, but convincing in a way that endears one to the characters. moreover, it's funny, without trying too hard at it.and, yes, i truly believe a sequel is warranted, here. see the movie, you'll understand why.highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.

this is not a film is a clever, witty and often heart touching movie. it's a retrospective of a failed relationship between michael connor (michael leydon campbell) and his estranged irish girlfriend grace mckenna. michael down on his luck decides to make a documentary replaying his whole relationship and what went wrong. he exploits his friendship with an actor he met at the gym nadia (nadia dajani) who he gets to play grace. the concept of this film is very original. michaels relationship is shown from every point whether it's a high or low. michael leydon campbell pulls off a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find grace. if fact most of the characters pull off great performances except the puzzler. the puzzler is needed to move the plot along yet seems too surreal to exist in a coffee shop. his monologues are often overdrawn and pointless. this is proved when he says "out of this chaos, we're all trying to create order. and out of the order, meaning. but in reality there is no such thing as meaning. something only has meaning if we make it have meaning."the commentary saves this movie. the commentary is done in the vain of this is spinal tap and has michael and his brother explain the problems they had while making the film. michael offers a very funny self conscious commentary that makes for some very good belly laughs.overall i'd give this movie a 7/10.

i've tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film, while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10. the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review, although a few have done that quite nicely already. this film is confusing, depressing, and doesn't have a happy ending. i still gave pola x a rating of 10, because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film. that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. i've only seen two of carax's films: this one and mauvis sang. as with this film, i'm being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of carax's best films- but i am. carax has a minimalist style. if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring, then it would be best not to watch this. but pola x was less minimalist than mauvis sang, so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller- at least for my taste. i found it quite interesting and absorbing. the two lead roles did an excellent job acting. (i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister.) catherine d. is always great, but her role was not very large or significant in the story. but everyone did a fine job. i thought the cult stuff was great. it may have not been very believable, but that is due to its being rather abstract. there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. this is a very freudian psycho-thriller.

leos carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that pola x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. seriously. if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, i would have thrashed pierre to within an inch of his life. no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe heathcliff in emily bronte's wuthering heights. after spending 134 minutes with pierre, i need a large glass of brandy. never have i been so angry at a main character. ok, having said that, pola x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and i'm talking graphic here, by the way. pola x will beat the hell out of you, though, so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it.

leos carax has made 3 great movies: boys meet girls, mauvais sang, les amants du pont neuf. in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth, the beauty of juvenile wilderness. carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was, but he tried to make his own vision of the art, without thinking about about all he have seen, but using it and melting it into his times. pola x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont neuf, a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars, a film that has destroyed everything on its way. after such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view. so leos carax has to changed, and he did. the movie isn't as beautiful as its first, it's more reasonable, no more studio, no more dreamed paris, carax has entered at last reality. it's not clean anymore, it's not poetic characters. carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it.

i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot. frankly, i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie. i was wrong. the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice. the film explores the identity crisis of pierre (guillaume depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequential (self-)destruction. the story is divided into two parts ¬ñ the first depicts pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed half-sister. both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography ¬ñ the first very colorful and bright, the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic - adding up to a true aesthetic feast. pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.

i agree with "johnlewis", who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved, i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating.examples : pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y ? pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship.pierre, lucie, and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain...lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he ? and isabelle, who is she really ?? overall, i think it was worth my time. an interesting film, and one that makes me want to read melville.

pola x is a beautiful adaption of herman melville's 'pierre; or, the ambiguities'. the comments on here surprise me, it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction. the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film - a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion. the story is of pierre's downfall - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - which is overtly demonstrated in his features, demeanour and idiolect. the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen, and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic.i can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching, as i did, with an open mind. you will, i hope, be rewarded in the same way that i was. i felt on edge and nervous from around the half-hour mark, however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense. it will leave you with 1,000 thoughts, each of them at once troublesome and thrilling. i know i'm gushing here, but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film. it's the best i've seen all year.

this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. not that that is bad, it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character. consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. if you liked dostoyevsky's 'crime and punishment," you will probably like this if only for the comparisons. the intriguing question that the movie prompts is, "what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set?" the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie. besides other philosophical questions, i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well. the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start. also, there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters. if these sorts of things do not impress you, skip it. overall i give this movie a 7.

no one would ever question that director leos carax is a genius, but what we wonder about is: is he an insane genius? so many people hated this film! i am normally the first person to accuse many french directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'l'enfant' and the pointless and offensive 'feux rouges'). but strangely enough, i actually think that 'pola x' is an amazing film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances. the film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than i believe i have ever seen on screen before. but then, carax is extreme, that we know. the film also contains what i consider way over-the-top trotskyite or anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams, what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing scott walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels. guillaume depardieu plays a rich young man in a ch√¢teau (whose step-mother is catherine deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way). but he suddenly 'snaps' completely when he discovers that his deceased father, a famous diplomat, had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by deneuve as an inconvenience. this is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak french coherently. depardieu then transforms himself into a 'class hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while scorning a vast inheritance. he then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people, though i have no objection to it, as i think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in america, where apparently it never happens. the intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama. the differences between carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme french films which i think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful, if harrowing, extreme emotional condition, whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background. many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but i don't agree. i believe carax was genuine, and was not making an exploitation picture at all. it is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who, for all i know, may be a complete madman, but i believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.

this is an ok early 80's horror flick in which a young girl (meg tilly) is wanting to shed her "goody two shoes" image and becomes part of a girl gang called the sisters. their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum. too bad the mausoleum is the "final" resting place of some psycho russian psychic and he's not quite dead yet. seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his telekinetic target practice, plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet. all proof that hitch hiking can be dangerous, so listen up girls. the daughter of this man (reymar) is rather distraught about her father's death and is confronted by a man that said he knew reymar and given a tape to listen too. her hubby (adam west, of batman fame) is there to laugh and scoff, and not much else. but it seems that perhaps reymar's daughter may also have some abilities that she doesn't realize. anyway, having deposited their unfortunate pledge at the mausoleum, the rest of the sisters take off to go get stuff (like masks, sheets, etc) to come back and scare the crap out of her, but little do they suspect what's going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them. for even in death reymar is kind of a busy guy and he's reanimating lots of corpses for entertainment. and it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait. overall this is acceptable horror, nothing too intense but not terrible either. the dvd from media blasters also contains another version of the movie that's a rough cut, i guess, i only watched a little of it so i don't know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what i saw i guess it's a "warts and all" presentation. 7 out of 10.

julie (meg tilly) is a "goody two shoes" type high school girl who, determined to prove something to herself, allows herself to be subjected to the rituals of "the sisters", a small-scale clique presided over by snooty, homecoming queen type carol (robin evans). the sisters propose that for julie's final test she will spend the night in a mausoleum, preparing to drive julie up the wall, but not knowing that recently deceased, ill-intentioned psychic raymar is interred there and has plans to cause havoc from beyond the grave.while this debut picture for tom mcloughlin ("friday the 13th part vi: jason lives" and "sometimes they come back") is limited by its obviously low budget, it's what mcloughlin and his crew are able to do with it that counts. it's genuinely creepy, unsettling fare; it might have very well scared the stuffing out of me if i were under 10 years of age, and even at my current age, it still got to me to a degree.some of the effects look cheesy, but the decent looking corpses and gore are created by tom burman, an experienced makeup effects artist, who, while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like winston, baker, and bottin, has a good resume with other films like "cat people" (1982) and "the beast within" to his credit.what i liked most about it was a real sense of foreboding and atmosphere, an aspect missing from some of the current trendy horror movies being shown in our multiplexes.tilly is cute and appealing in her role, having recently completed her debut film work in "tex" before joining this production. "one dark night" was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983, where it actually did decent business during its first few weeks. the other actors do what they have to do well enough; familiar faces in the supporting cast include the equally appealing veteran singer / actress / voice-over artist elizabeth (a.k.a. e.g.) daily, kevin peter hall, for once *not* playing some sort of creature character, but who unfortunately ends up with very little screen time, and none other than adam "batman" west. the director's wife nancy, who would play lizbeth in "jason lives", appears here as the spacey girl in front of the arcade.it's decent b-level horror entertainment, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe not that slick (hey, mcloughlin *was* just starting out), but definitely good for some chills.7/10

i thought that one dark night was great! it deserves a 10! as to a statement made by one user, the dead were actually zombies in this movie. a dead person brought back to life is a zombie, regardless of the method or cause for/of being brought back to life. the "zombies" in this movie are used to frighten the girls, not to feed off of them, like traditional zombies. this movie is a definite star among horror flicks of the 80's. the score and atmosphere are quite eerie, and the audience is kept in suspense throughout the mausoleum scenes. the acting is actually convincing, with genuine expressions of horror at the sight of the undead. although i enjoy all zombie flicks, this movie is a refreshing change from the typical "flesh-eating zombie" movie.

this is my favorite horror film, a close 2nd to 'poltergeist'. i saw 'one dark night' when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i worked.i was born in 1963, so i have a certain love for '80's horror films, despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written. what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of 'psychic vampirism' has not been addressed (at least, to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon.i didn't care if adam west was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but thought meg tilly was good casting. the little-known donald hutton (from 'brainstorm' and 'invaders from mars') as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on ramar's abilities was sadly overlooked. as a gay guy, i was paying more attention to david mason daniels, meg tilly's unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend. he's selling real estate in texas now. i felt the film 'realistic' in two ways: raymar, who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment, had a funeral that was sparse in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious, a hermit, but a killer. as you know, these types are buried without fanfare. second, if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile, they would hover, dragging their feet. the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking, groaning, arms out-stretched zombies, but opted for what would be believable. kudos! the buzzing electrical discharge from ramar's eyes at his 'throne coffin' (like he's overseeing his kingdom of dead), cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! if you've ever gone to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows. don't get me started on the cavernous silence. even ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. the score was one-of-a-kind and memorable, and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out. the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be. i especially liked the carefully-planned characteristics of each corpse: the bride, the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall thin black guy, and the half-faced world war ii vet, and the green-slimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the 'sisters' clique initiators. even corpses can be good actors, i suppose. the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julie's boyfriend couldn't possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on it's stomach and feet first, but why? it looked a little to fresh too.the film begins eerie, with us never seeing ramar's face (until the last quarter of the film, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughter's psychic flash. we then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see he's experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall. the rest does drag as the heathers-like 'sisters' group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed build up to the unleashing horror later. the movie isn't bloody in any sense of the word. the goriest part is when ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him, and he bubbles then melts. i've always felt that a power like ramar's could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into. i can see it now: one dark night ii: turning in the grave. but let's face it-the film stands alone. i heard the film had other titles, but the original fits.a remake would be pointless. but if there were to be one, i would write better dialog, and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on ramar's abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. in this information age, something like that would be well documented on dvd. and more corpses! why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when ramar's power could spread to the graveyard too? let's just say i'd hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that too can be shown. i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character. with cg effects, some awesome scenes with ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall! say what you will about,'one dark night' but it has it all. so see at least once in your life...or death!

famous and mysterious recluse raymar, who's some kind of lethal telekinetic psychic vampire, abruptly dies under bizarre circumstances. nice girl high school student julie wells (a warm and sympathetic performance by the lovely meg tilly) wants desperately to be accepted by the snobby clique the sisters (played to sublimely bitchy perfection by leslie speights, robin evans and the ever-cuddly elizabeth daily), so she agrees to spend a night in a creepy mausoleum where raymar's body has been interred as part of an initiation rite. naturally, raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it's going to be a very long and harrowing night of pure nerve-wracking terror for poor julie.director/co-screenwriter tom mcloughlin (who later gave us the enjoyably tongue-in-cheek "friday the 13th part vi: jason lives") eschews graphic gore in favor of creating a brooding and eerie atmosphere, but fails to pull this particular feat off because the first hour is way too slow, talky and uneventful to be remotely scary or suspenseful. however, i nonetheless still found this flawed fright flick to be oddly appealing and entertaining. the big poofy hairdos, a goofy music montage sequence, badly timed false scares (including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), a scene at a glittery video game arcade, kids gleefully smoking pot, and the hilariously dumb teen slang ("nerdle brain"!?) give this picture a certain endearingly quaint 80's period charm. hal trussell's handsome, polished cinematography (i especially dug the smoothly gliding steadicam tracking shots), bob summers' spooky, yet funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and tom burman's splendidly ghoulish make-up f/x are all up to snuff. the ever-stolid adam west of tv's "batman" fame merely takes up space in a nothing secondary part. the mausoleum makes for an impressively vast and unsettling main location. the grand finale with a bunch of ghastly rotting corpses popping out of their coffins and floating about qualifies as a marvelously macabre shock set piece. sure, this baby definitely ain't some unjustly unsung gem, but it still delivers plenty of pleasingly silly and diverting cheesy fun all the same.

well groomed, well behaved teen meg tilly must spend the night in a creepy mausoleum as an initiation into a high school club. problem is a powerful psychic named raymar was just buried there that day, but he isn't quite dead and he needs the life force of humans for his powers.obscure horror film offers plenty of thrills and chills, an appealing and likeable cast, and most superior special effects.my rating: 7 out of 10.one dark night is rated r for violence and adult themes.

by the way it looks at the other comments made, it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick. it is not centered around zombies, as a matter of fact they are not zombies at all, they are a device regenerated by the wizard to scare the girls to death, his main focus is on meg tilly, who he wants to help him finish the job that he died while doing in the first place, and what you get is a great flick with an awesome ending, it is hard to find on video, but every once in a while it shows up on hbo or cinamax, check it out, i gave it a 10 and highly recommend it.

i actually first watched one dark night in the theater & wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper. i loved it then & i still love it. the storyline revolves around two people. first of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death. she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death. the mauseleum he's buried in plays host to the other main person, a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her & dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group. they go back in the night to scare her & find scares for themselves. the cast is led by meg tilly with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka e.g. daily. check this one out if you love 80's movies & cheesy horror movies, you won't be disatisfied.

one dark night has a typical teen horror film set-up with a quite a unique twist. the ultra-brooding musical score and gothic/claustrophobic atmosphere adds greatly to this small film that delivers. meg tilly is excellent as "julie," and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum, giving a sense of foreboding and loneliness. the other teens are equally effective in their roles as is melissa newman, the ultimate heroine of the film. the special effects are excellent, though dated. this film is highly overlooked, but that may be good so that it was never ruined by endless sequels. there is a great, dark magic flowing through this film; once tapped into, you really get it and you're in for some fun. the double-disc dvd is available, though the original negative could not be found to restore the film. maybe someday it will be located. i guess in some ways the carbon speckles in parts do help the film by giving it an old school respectability and making it more unexpected at the end when suddenly there are plenty of effects.the second disc has a rough cut/alternate version with a temp score version of the film that gives more explanation of the demise of two of the girls, very poe-ish("the cask of amontillado" comes to mind in a new way!) also, great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening. not sure it had the punch for main stream audiences, but certainly worked for me and extremely creepy.. . also, there is a making of documentary that is interesting because it gives info on what was going on at the time with the actors, crew, director and writer; candid material, then current logos, discussions of shots and scenes, rehearsals. very unique that this stuff exists for a small film back then.

multiply named and strangely casted, "one dark night" aka "mausoleum", is one of the better early horror video-rentals. original and quite raw, we meet adam west briefly in this film about telekinesis and teen-age headgames. meg tilly is dared into spending the night in a crypt by "the sisters" a high-school gang of hair-hoppers in blue satin jackets. the initiation is interrupted by the recently interred body of a mass-murdering psychic wizard called "raymar". surprisingly awesome make-up and scare effects paints this chiller film with style and deliver a heart-pounding climax.

pistol-packing pam grier takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in "asylum of satan" director william girdler's entertaining blaxploitation actioneer "sheba baby," co-starring d'urville martin and austin stoker. "sheba baby" is one of several tough chick flicks that grier appeared in during the 1970s, including "coffy," "foxy brown," and "friday foster." the short-lived girdler co-wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer david shelton in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business. unfortunately, "sheba baby" isn't nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that grier made under the supervision of director jack hill. hill helmed the african-american north carolina native in "coffy," "foxy brown," "the big bird cage," and "the big doll house." anybody that analyzes images of african-american women in cinema should be familiar with these epics. the chief problem with "sheba baby" is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. naturally, the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldn't hit the side of a barn with a howitzer. as the main antagonist, dick merrifield qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like: "anything worth having is worth stealing." additionally, composer monk huggins does provide a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with barbara mason warbling it, is "good man is gone." "sheba baby" casts grier as stylist chicago gumshoe sheba shayne. she leaves the windy city to return to her hometown of louisville, kentucky, to help out her father. when she arrives in louisville, sheba learns that her father, andy (rudy challenger of "detroit 9000"), is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed pilot (cigar-chomping d'urville martin of "hammer") who demands that andy sell out his loan company to pilot or die.initially, pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash andy's office, but our heroine's father catches them in the act. they turn sheba's father into a punching bag. interestingly, during the fight scene, girdler rarely shows fists smashing flesh. earlier, andy's right-hand man, brick williams (austin stoker of "horror high"), had sent sheba a telegram requesting that she return to louisville, but she didn't receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn't know where to find her. brick and sheba hook up, rekindle their romantic flames, and share a night in the sack. brick spends most of his time urging sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. as a former louisville, kentucky, police woman, sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second. after she arrives home, sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes being blown to bits. as she is walking out the door to get into her father's car, andy receives another harassing call from pilot. previously, andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to pilot, but andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum. a gratified pilot warns andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse. in other words, cranking up the car won't trigger the explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. andy and brick rescue sheba before the car blows up. earlier, sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference. "dad, i know you think i'm doing a man's job, but i'm not going to sit on the sidelines just because i'm a woman," sheba tells him. after her near-death experience, sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her father's car. she grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information. only after sheba has ground the guy's face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a pay-off at the town's railroad museum. brick accompanies sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered pilot getting away by the skin of his chin.later, pilot sends a quintet of out-of-town contract thugs armed-to-the-teeth to trash andy's office. these gunsels ignore their no-kill orders. not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons, but they also blast sheba's dad with a shotgun. sheba retaliates in short order. wielding her nickel-plated revolver, she guns down three of the four assailants dirty harry style. the last hit-man discards his weapon and pleads for mercy. sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective phil jackson (charles kissinger of "abby") and a uniform cop arrive on the scene. at the hospital, andy shayne dies holding his daughter's hand. naturally, pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy. afterward, sheba tracks down a loan shark, walker (christopher joy of "cleopatra jones"), and pries information out of him about the pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash. this is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming. walker warns pilot about sheba. pilot and his henchmen confront sheba in a parking lot and swap lead. sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. while the police corner one of pilot's men, she deals with the others. pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and sheba runs him down. she pins pilot to a roller-coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller-coaster cuts his head off. pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man, shark (dick merrifield of "the hellcats"), whose reputation is so immaculate that detective jackson describes him as "the guy with all the right answers." "sheba baby" isn't top-notch pam grier. however, the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick.

if anything, william girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time. i mean, a blaxploitation flick in louisville, kentucky..who would of thunk it?!?! i can just imagine the enthusiasm he must've had getting pam grier, quite a hot item, to star in his picture. if you are pretty familiar with the genre, girdler's sheba, baby doesn't necessarily stray too far from formula. despite a change of venue, the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed shark who muscles in on loan companies, using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures. grier is sheba shayne, a former louisville cop working in chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner, brick(austin stoker, assault on precinct 13). sheba's father, despite shark's bullying tactics(..his man in town is pilot, a wannabe gangster, equipped with stooges who aren't that menacing, rather buffoonish in nature, so thin-skinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the shayne loan building), won't give up his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force, leads to his being killed. sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. in other words, shark's ass is grass..can you dig it? seeing grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film, the novelty of the setting being in louisville is part of the package. you even get to see a speedboat chase, grier in shootouts with gangsters(..not necessarily the most polished kind one might be accustomed to seeing in a chicago or new york during this period in blaxploitation), lots of blood spurting from bullet-riddled bodies torn apart by gun-fire, and colorful characters(..such as a wimpy loan shark in pimp-dress named walker and pilot who is one of the least scary mobsters you are likely to see)who show up during the film, most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry sheba. the plot itself is nothing special, but grier is always worth watching, and girdler orchestrates plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained. a modest success for girdler, and one of his more accomplished films.

sheba baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that a grier movie gets. all that the pg means is that pam doesn't take her top off, she takes her top off in every other movie she's been in though so. it is more exciting than coffy, more action. it takes off slow but by the time she's on screen the thrills have started. like dolemite d'urville martin is the heavy trying to get sheba's father, but she ain't having that. she wages a one woman war against martin and his gang of cronies. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which i'm still laughing about. i thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but i was wrong it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplotation film that can only be good!

sheba baby, is another pam grier blaxploitation film. it was one of pam's less visceral films of this genre. pam plays sheba shane, who's a chicago gumshoe. sheba's father is the owner of a small loan company, in missouri. when local mobsters try to run her father of of business, sheba goes after the bad guys.pam grier had already made her mark in blaxploitation films, by the time sheba baby came along. fans of both coffy and foxy brown, know that pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. in sheba baby, the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from pam, wasn't as evident in this film. not that pam doesn't kick-butt in sheba baby. she's just not as much of a runaway-train vigilante, as she was in her previous blaxploitation films.the supporting cast in this film, are a distinct disappointment. so sheba baby is pam's film, through and through. and though pam's a bit more subdued than in her other films, she still gives a compelling performance in sheba baby. this film is definitely worth your time, if you're an ardent pam grier fan.

yeah, i guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of pam grier's other films. the plot is overly familiar, the dialog stilted, and some of the acting isn't too good. but it's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film, where we see ms grier in a sexy blue wetsuit, with the zipper half unzipped. yeah, it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of pam grier's talent, but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman, and back in the day, she had a body that wouldn't quit. it's nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit. rent the dvd, and then tell me i'm wrong. can't, can you? that's because you know i'm right! :-) and yes, i really did give a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes! ;-)

i thought it would be more fantastic a tale. but the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the death carriage i was expecting. in fact there is much more of a social drama. as usual in the "european authors' movies".actors are interesting, not overacting as in the average silent movie. images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in bergman's smultronst√§llet.this is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here. smultronst√§llet begins with a vision of a death carriage wherein sj√∂str√∂m's character can see his own body. there are clocks without hands. he is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong. there is a vision of his happy family in the country. in k√∂rkarlen sj√∂str√∂m's wife doesn't cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him. eventually, edit's confession is some kind of a live judgement.well i would just add that sj√∂str√∂m destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of the shining. which was much more of a fantasy tale with death hanging around.

it's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. most early german films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early german romantics like e. t. a. hoffman and others. in fritz lang's "der mude tod" (also from 1921) death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheart, but in lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death.in victor seastrom's "korkarlen," however, repentance is always an option. destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. although scenes of the phantom carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of death as the great leveler are compromised by death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, david holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with.one new year's eve holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight holm must become the driver of the phantom carriage and collect souls during the new year. the phantom carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started holm on his road to ruin, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. along the way holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him.perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the selma lagerl√∂f novel on which the film is based. but i would have preferred to see david holm unable to escape his destiny, and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself, and to see holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls. it would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. in the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny isn't the message; redemption is. the driver of the carriage allows holm's spirit to return to his body, and he rescues his family in the nick of time. his repentance smacks of scrooge's repentance in "a christmas carol." if the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. the special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day, and still hold up, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. also, the restored film on tartan's new dvd looks fabulous.

once upon a time, in sweden, there was a poor salvation army sister. at death's door, she requests, "send for david holm!" but, victor sj√∂str√∂m (as david holm) cannot be located, because he is spending new year's eve in a graveyard, with his drinking buddies. dying sister astrid holm (as edit) wants to see if praying for mr. sj√∂str√∂m's soul, over the past year, has produced any results; arguably, it has not. in the graveyard, sj√∂str√∂m tells the story of "the phantom carriage", which he heard from his dead friend tore svennberg (as georges). according to legend, the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people, until being relieved next new year's eve...director sj√∂str√∂m, whose lead performance is very strong, combines with photographer julius jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. the great "double exposure" effect is used frequently, but never seems overdone; and, it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable (for example, sj√∂str√∂m's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door). a selma lagerl√∂f story probably wasn't one you could, or would want to, tamper with in the 1920s - which may, or may not be, why the ending of this film is a letdown. and, unlike similar spiritual stories, it's difficult to suspend your disbelief, if you think too carefully about what is really happening in "k√∂rkarlen".******* k√∂rkarlen (1/1/21) victor sj√∂str√∂m ~ victor sj√∂str√∂m, hilda borgstr√∂m, tore svennberg

victor sjostrom, who is the grandfather of swedish cinema, directed this stark, existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the bleakest moments of the human condition. he stars as david holm, a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage: death.unlike many silent films during the period, the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting. the pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar dickensian narrative. however, examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, it's a very daring and unique film. audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. it's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure.watching the film, it's easy to see the later influences this film had on swedish master ingmar bergman. most of the great bergman themes are here on full display. sjostrom, of course, later starred in bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: wild strawberries. this would be sjostrom's final performance as an actor. sjostrom based the script on a novel by swedish writer selma lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.

the last person who dies before new years, is cursed to drive the phantom carriage for a whole year, picking up the souls of the dead.i saw a scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube, and decided to track down the whole movie. it was well worth the work finding it, because it's an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made. it has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere. the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. sadly, many of today's film makers don't seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are, and go for the cheap jump scares. the visual effects are excellent, considering its date of production. if you can find a copy of this, i highly recommend giving it a watch. 9/10

this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the grapevine video release which also includes the english translation of selma lagerlof's novel which she based on a swedish folktale. the first version is the swedish edit under the title of the phantom carriage. the second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the stroke of midnight as released by metro (before it was m-g- m). the actual us release has long vanished but a detailed review in the new york times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release -- and both are fascinating to see. each version of this film was presented at the organ loft in salt lake city with live theatre organ scores provided by artist blaine gale. a live recording was made of these performances and are included on the grapevine video dvd along with the novel and notes about the two versions. while the phantom carriage follows the order of lagerlof's novel, the stroke of midnight is in some ways easier to follow. seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries. some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not. this is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message. the directing and lead performance by the great victor sjostrom were way ahead of their time. it's easy to see why m-g-m brought him to hollywood to direct such films as lillian gish in the scarlet letter and the wind as well as lon chaney in he who gets slapped. in america he was known as victor seastrom. he would also star in the lead role of ingmar bergman's wild strawberries, giving a masterful performance. bergman was greatly influenced by korkarlen or the phantom carriage in his earlier days. this is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study. the grapevine video release is an excellent way to do this.

i have just finished watching this film for the first time, and i must say that i am very impressed.how bleak. how full of despair. how nightmarish. incredible.visually stunning, several scenes are embedded in my mind...the first appearance of the phantom carriage...the soul of david holm as it rises from his corpse...his spirit on his knees, pleading.this film takes a simple story-that of the ghostly driver of the phantom carriage, doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year-brings it into the present setting of the film and then uses flashbacks as a means to explain how david holm ends up in his predicament.i would love to see this released on dvd so that more might see it. everyone should.

i don't understand why it is so underrated on imdb.. this movie is just the perfection.. the better adaptation of all times of the myth of tarzan! as a french, i can say that this is the better role of christophe lambert, ridiculous in a lots of movies, but here absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! the plot is great, well told, the story magnificent, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, every things are perfect! how believe these sequences with the elgar music, just simply perfect..greystoke is truly an unbelievable movie, underrated here, i don't really know why, but really appreciated

beautifully filmed, acclaimed director hugh hudson (chariots of fire) creates a story that brings the entire legend of john clayton, lord greystoke and tarzan of the apes to life with reverence and dignity, and with a scope not heretofore seen in tarzan films. christopher lambert makes his starring debut as the young lord, raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in africa. later returned to what is to him an alien world, that of class and privilege, he feels totally out of place. once he learns what has happened to the apes that raised him and their world he realizes that he must go back. a sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas. this is one of those films that is a must for every cinemaphile's collection.

i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day...today it was the guardian. i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it, and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie. well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought. it was a great story first of all. ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film. being a big fan of that 70's show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting he did in the butterfly effect, but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor.it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the u.s. coast guard.

i felt cheated out of knowing the whole story. while there could be a twist, this twist was so significant, that i felt betrayed. i believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better. the writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the movie, rather than all at once at the end. that aside, i believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly matt damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing. the other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another. the cohesiveness of the group in ocean's eleven was gone.

despite what its critics ensue, i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is. eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before, won oscars, is at the top of his game. ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, steve's day at the midway if you will. i am generally not a fan of zeta-jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie. it's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and i will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of george and brad and matt parlay through clooney's digs in lago di como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again. if we tolerated 3 installments of the lord of the rings, i ask if we can drool over clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time?

"strike force" or "the librarians" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. william forsythe stars as simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. he meets up with sandi (erika eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. but there are evil bad guys afoot. the most evil of them all is marcos canarious (andrew divoff). marcos likes to kill people. so now, simon and sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. the whole cast is great, with divoff stealing the movie. there are also cameos by ed lauter and burt reynolds. if you are looking for a good action film, watch this and have a good time.

i just called my brother paulie on the phone and he said he was watching hoods and it was funny. so, like i said, never go against the family! the demand for more lines is ok since i like to express my own opinions quite frequently. if something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. this gives me yet another chance to take my shots at "the departed". when one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful. all you need is a good directer,the same guy i believe who did my favorite mob movie, "goodfellows), but in a completely different way.and then just throw in jack the great and you got yourself an oscar. easy as pie. i have to see hoods to make sure it wasn't better than "the departed" gibbs

hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!? although i haven't seen "dahmer" (2002) i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction. i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man. this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. i loved this movie! just brace yourself for low budget and no blood. its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest. my favorite line is : "if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives" enjoy!

this film is the most traumatising and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life. to know that this film is based on a true story and watching jeffrey dahmer(carl crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. i admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why jeffrey dahmer was a psycotic maniac. as he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer. every person that he lured back to his apartment, he was attracted to and had feelings for, and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him. in the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what i noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him. it was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons.the scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart. one scene that i found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with jeffrey. when the guy left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at jeffrey. i also found that carl crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of jeffrey dahmer. his evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, i was shivering in my seat. his facial expressions reminded me of the way vincent d'onofrio (private pyle/leonard) in the film 'full metal jacket' looked just before he gunned-down the general in the toilet barracks.if your an emotional person i wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not, than go ahead and watch it.

this is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account. let's filter the more judgmental..ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer? can you withstand an independent, low-budget film? are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. this film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography. it isn't a glamorized, unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film "dahmer" (2001) was. the movie begins with dahmer, played quite convincingly by carl crew, sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment. his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past-tense, narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times. we get to know the character, both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life. it isn't anyone's fault but dahmer's that 17 people died, but being a criminal psychology student, i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented, truthfully, in this film. you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship, but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers. it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence, with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain. you do see two deaths that i remember, one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid. while you don't see anything graphic, this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene. and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low, you will see the results. there is a prop hand and head or two, but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive. besides, these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible. although acceptable, they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing. the film actually concludes before dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior. that's about the only big difference from the real story, and the information that remains is, as i've stated, very true to the facts. the film quality could be better, the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet, and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy, but it's not overboard. in my opinion, this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of america's most remembered serial killers. i think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well, and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner, aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer.

got this the other day from the creators on dvd. i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel, had never heard anything about it. after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it. i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeen.1st off im not a big sci-fi fan (baring star wars) i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location, i was presently surprised. this didn't turn out to be a standard sci-fi, more like a mix of sci-fi and survival horror.had a good storyline, which was different, had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with ¬£8000. acting was better than average for a low budget film. the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice.weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe mode.all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys, maybe a all out horror next (hint hint). the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers, i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd release.excellent work keep it up

i loved this movie! yes, it is rather cheap and i'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. but my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. i was reminded of the early work of sam raimi. yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. the acting ranges from the very good in scott ironside and shawn paul hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. is it a cult movie? well it grew on me. first time i liked it but by the 3rd viewing i was loving it. the movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but i'm giving it 8 for sheer cheek. anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching. almost makes me want to visit scotland!

i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!!!the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a 'escape pod', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props. maybe this is even a good thing, forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film, as the centers of the work, instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights (starwars).the cgi is fine. it is not exactly 'seamless'... but imho it still works. why? because there isn't too much of it, and what there is, is not 'taking over' with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot. it prompts the imagination... it's some relatively simple stuff, with decent composition (especially the heavy freighter shot.. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds...that tracks the entire length of the ship... it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0.75 seconds), and some relation to the story. it might look old or not 'state of the art', but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story.the acting is good, except the characters die too fast to get to know them. the captain was great, but a few of his scenes could have used another take. i also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse, i like to think captains are calm cool and in control... what was going on in that scene? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment? did he feel himself losing control? now, as for the plot.... mostly it is good... why? because it doesn't try to explain itself. it just happens. it's called 'the planet', its a mystery, get it?? nobody knows why there is a statue, and they don't find out either. the mysterious cult? the weird scientist with the tattoo? what do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes? this isn't war and peace. and, thank god, it's not star wars/trek either. no midichlorians, no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story. the characters are stranded, and are only able to figure out a few basic things... it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer. it is mysterious, and i liked that. i don't know why, maybe i can identify with these guys more , since they don't know whats happening, and i don't either... they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening. in fact, i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the 'traitor' turns on the crew, and tries to 'explain' the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog, imho, in the whole movie, and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene. ok, sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious, though. like, why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning? that was odd. just weird. the 'hamlet' ending... again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better. and would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end? this is not a serial show, it was a film, and we like closure in films, even if they can have a sequel. imagine hamlet with no 'flights of angels sing thee to thy rest'anyways. what can i say. this was well worth the dollar i payed at the 'red box' machine at the supermarket. it was also, imho, a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3. like i said, it sucked me in, wanting to know what was happening, and i couldn't stop watching until the end.

ok, so maybe it's because i'm from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film, but i found this great fun. cheap fun to be sure, but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all. i was actually quite effected when they died. in particulare when the captain finally fell. the script? well it;s a game of 2 halfs. the opening half of the film is well written and sharp. the last half hour is not so great, with many questions left unanswered. this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me. but nevertheless, good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton.

on many levels it's very good. in fact, considering that this was a low-budget british indie by a first time feature-director with a largely neophyte cast, it's a magnificent achievement. i don't know how much it cost. the figure of ¬£8,000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is. the point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that great special effects, terrific production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. even having said that, much of the script was great. the characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things. throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. if the whole film was like the second act, it would be stunning.before the ship blows up, twelve people make it to individual escape pods or 'e-pods' which blast away from the ship. they're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea where they're going - but that makes sense. i like the e-pods - they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. i also like the way that we are specifically told, later, that they are designed for ship-to-ship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet. that said, it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but in he gets. (and it has just occurred to me: shouldn't the captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there?) anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. we have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.the captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'captain behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. but they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. the engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. it can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. the captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. that's kid. i really liked the way that he now points out that his name is david and the captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. that was good storytelling and good characterisation.

i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film?? its not because of money spent on it that's for sure!! did i see a painted water pistol in there? maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland? or maybe they just didn't have any money? the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. awesome! but what i really liked was the grit of the performances. mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys. no hollywood histrionics here.ok, so the effects work isn't very good. the spaceships just don't look as good as they should in todays fx world and i've seen much better free stuff on youtube. but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet. was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew? or is it just better effects work? did they edit out the water? by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died.

i'd buy that for a dollar!!!i did buy this film for a dollar and i've seen much worse for much more!!this is a scottish sci-fi film from mark stirton and according to the making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. eight grand!!! that wouldn't pay for half a minute in hollywood!! nevertheless ---- this is top fun film making. if you like things gritty then you're in for a treat. these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing. i didn't mind, but my girl friend did!! the actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see people that i've never heard of or seen before. it meant i had no idea who was going to die first.if you watch a movie for it's 'latest of the latest' visual effects then watch a star wars. the effects here are ok, but kinda weak in space. but the monsters are very well done if a bit pred like.stirton does an amazing job with not very much and i'd love to see his take on a real hollywood movie. it least it wasn't predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off!!! ok, so it is a little derivative of other sci-fi, but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci-fi film for 8 g's is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry.good marks for a good film, extra marks for working so hard, extra extra marks for a really interesting making of. no standard bull here, all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in mancha only with a film at the end. but why no commentary? keep going scots!

the '7' rating is not necessarily a smear-- this movie was done on a low budget-- but done well within its limits.a usual pot-boiler plot-- ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoner escape in pods, land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up. mayhem ensues, a lot of ammo is expended.the special effects were spare and properly done, emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap looking plastic props. plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart.i peg this one as a lite saturday afternoon flick. you can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it'll still be enjoyable. even better, your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment-- and she'll be happy: after all, she got to talk to you! it's that type of movie.anyways, the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet, but hey, this is a guns 'n' ammo action movie. cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have beer and chips at hand. so don't get get yourself into a brain-cramp over the ending.

got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. not that this ever bothered me anyway, since i love low budget sci-fi like dr who, blake's 7 and dark star. hell, even outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.the story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. they then discover the prisoner has made it too, he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems.the effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. films like i, robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of hollywood's offerings.whilst none of the actors get oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't outstay its welcome. the characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they didn't in predator either, which it resembles in feel. big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn.some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end, but i like it. unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and i'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further.a cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. if this is what they can do on a shoestring i'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.recommended.

wow!! talk about a film that divides the audience! this is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. personally i really enjoyed it. i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand! people can be real stupid. no, this film is far more in common with the thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) lots of carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood. perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it's deference to other carpenter works. not least dark star which it has something in common with. i'd be interested to know how much it really cost? $8000? is that even possible? maybe it was based on a short film that cost $8000? but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died. they are so underplayed that it's like watching a documentary at times. having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and i'm not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them. but his gun is awesome!! give it a chance, if you like early carpenter you might fall for it, just don't expect 2001.

every once in a while you stumble across a movie that takes you by surprise and this is one of them. on the surprise scale this would rate as sharing a hot tub with jessica alba whilst a band consisting of elvis, jimi hendrix, john lennon, phil lynott and keith moon play you music for the night. the reason why this film will surprise you is that for the meagre budget they had (¬£8,000) and that this was done by a bunch of mates who just wanted to try it out they have produced something very slick and looks easily 100 times more than its budget.the plot is simple a crew of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space come under attack and are forced to crash land on a nearby desolate planet. after some checks not only does the planet not exist according to star charts but they are not alone as it seems and something very unfriendly begins to pick them of one by one. it sounds like very standard sci-fi fare mixing elements of aliens. predator and pitch black but it takes all these and makes them into something that feels fresh and original.the location shooting in this is fantastic, utilising balmeddie beach in aberdeen to the maximum and you genuinely feel that you are one an alien world. the seemingly never ending sand dunes and clever lighting effects give it a very bleak feel , you truly think the crew are stranded on an alien world. also the action sequences are superb, the opening assault on the freighter a great showcase of what special effects can be achieved on a budget and the firefights as well as the stunning finale all showcase the inventiveness of the film.as for the team of mercenaries the cast excels themselves. for a low budget independent movie the casting here was done via local media outlets and they seem to have picked some possible stars for the future. local body builder mike mitchell whilst not a natural actor slots into his role as the arnie-esq leader of the mercenaries. from the rest of the cast there are two stand out performances patrick wright as second in command mcneal and scott ironside as the rough and ready engineer vince. both have some the best lines in the movie and scott injects a good bit of humour into the movie with his performance. patrick gives a well rounded performance as the cool as ice second in command.director mark stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that scottish cinema need not all be 'kilts and ceilidhs' or 'slums and drugs' scottish films can be fresh, inventive and most of all a lot of god damn fun. this film is scottish (with a north east flavour) to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact which adds to the charm of the piece. although the budget limitations show from time to time (the only fault i could find) that is to be expected. this film, its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then some more. i for one wish mark and his crew every success and theirs is a career to keep a very close eye on.rating - 9/10 the first scottish sci-fi is bold, fresh and inventive a real triumph.movie reviews, news and opinion like no other plus the kick ass bi-weekly pod-casts.www.fightrunner.co.uk contact@fightrunner.co.uk

"the planet" is an astounding piece of film making. for a mere ¬£8000 stirton production have turned out one of the most original sci-fi films for a long time.starring the physically intimidating mike mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well planned action. from the opening space battle, to the pounding finale, everything about this film appears well above it's budget.to start with the special effects, while certainly not "revenge of the sith" standard, they are on level, if not above, the likes of babylon 5 and farscape. and for a snip of a price as well. the detail and the movement is superb, and captures the imagination from the off. the design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is second to none. the imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise for a film of this budget.another surprise was the strength of the story, and the arc it takes. there are a few twists and turn, most of which are well written into the script, surprising and well played out. i was surprised that, two years in the making and first imagined 15 years ago, how relevant some aspects of the story are to today's society. with the happenings around the world, there may be a certain resonance with the lengths the mercenaries are forced to go to in order to survive.even the sounds effects are spot on, as is the atmospheric music. the use of light and costume add further to the professional look. balmedie beach in aberdeen looks a desolate and lonely place.in all honesty this film looks 10, if not 100, times the budget spent, and that's testament to a creative, hard working team of people, from the director, to the cast, to the effects via the producer and sound team. wonderful effort, i recommend you get your hand on a copy asap

gzsz is the longest running daily soap in germany and it's cult! i started watching it from the first day on and i got hooked on it right from the start. over the years so much has changed, the old characters like heiko, elke, tina, saskia etc. left, and new ones appeared like marie, kai, cora or john. i have to say that i liked gzsz better in the years 1995-2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. my favorite character is sonja wiebe because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. tina bordihn was great as the first sonja but as tokessa became the recast of sonja the character got even better.

okay, i'm just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show. i happen to think this show is awesome. (i mean when jasmin weber was still on and franzi was still alive, so addicting!). and i was surprised to learn that this was categorized as a soap, because it just doesn't carry the same look and feel as soaps in america. soaps here are absolutely horrific! at least gzsz films on location, features real music and more plausible story lines. moreover, the acting on gzsz, for the most part, is quite believable especially with josephine schmidt and felix jascheroff. (plus, soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules). if it's ratings are that high, it must be doing something right; soaps in america are shown in the day-time and, historically, have always had rock-bottom ratings. give gzsz a chance! trust me, it's good!

i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. while the underlying "general" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment. the "specific" storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "wowing"...i haven't seen such angry seas since "the perfect storm". co-star clancy brown (hbo's "carnivale" - great to see him again) played the captain of the coast guard's kodiak, alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. the film wonderfully, and finally, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard; it had the audience applauding at the end.

all the reviewers are making one big mistake. this movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.it was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. if you hated that period, or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it, then this is garbage, but only because it wasn't meant for you. the low budget here and failure of the beastmaster 1 at the box office (grossed under four mil. with a nine mil. budget) were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day. you can complain about the story, dialog or logic, but again this was made to run, not to win races. if the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure, but it doesn't do that for a second (in "our" world, dar sees a movie theater that's advertising the beastmaster 2, enough said). to paraphrase clint eastwood from dirty harry movies: this movie knows it's limitations. it's more of a comedy/parody then usual adventure. soundtrack (for the time) was also great. actors aren't taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating "spoiled rich brat" role (played here very well by young kari wuhrer) turns out good. so, if you are nostalgic for the 80ies/90ies (cheese) culture, or you liked the first part, and don't mind going out on a cheese limb, you'll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive dar in the 90ies (literarly). this is not really the sequel to the first, and don't watch it if that's what you want. it's more of a "what if" fantasy sequel.as for the "why different dimension and not just different time" question: when in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones (from the end of part 1)? by the way, the movie ends in the zoo because of an attempt at a cheap (moneywise) big finale. it's suppose to be the best place for dar to show all his moves (him being the manipulator of animals).

i liked this movie way too much. my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside. of corse ironside is just a low rent jack nicholson. i guess mike was busy that year with "highlander 2: the quickening". sadly "beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career move. it is certainly the best of the beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic "masters of the universe". not only does it star the incomparable mark singer it also features an amazing supporting cast, specifically the second girl from "sliders", uncle phil from "fresh prince of belair" and evil chick from "superman 2". it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets. beastmaster forever!!! rock'n roll!!!

when i was younger, and today, mr. bean is a work of genius. three-time bafta nominated rowan atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking alien dropped onto earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. he has tried to do an exam, put his pants on in front of blind man (he didn't know he was blind), gone to church, tried to dive at a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, seen a scary movie, changed in his car, had a picnic with a fly intruding, spent christmas with his girlfriend (matilda ziegler), looked after a baby in portsmouth, been to room 426 of the queens hotel in portsmouth, won a pet contest with his teddy, driven on top of his mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the queen. guests included rudolph walker, richard briers, angus deayton, nick hancock from they think it's all over, caroline quentin, the day today's david schneider, richard wilson, the fast show's eryl maynard and the vicar of dibley's roger lloyd-pack. it was nominated the baftas for best comedy (programme or series) and best light entertainment programme. rowan atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors, he was number 24 on the comedians' comedian, and he was number 8 on britain's favourite comedian. outstanding!

there was once someone in my family (not saying who it is because of personal reasons) who thinks that mr bean is always so silly in whatever he does on the comedy series. imagine how i felt at that time. shocked instantly.there are more reasons than one why i love watching mr bean. being one of those earliest shows on the local television here in my country where i first grew up watching, it's just one of those things which had stuck into my head. there was even once my friends and i talked about few of the selected episodes and we just laughed together.it's always silly, funny and hilarious in whatever antics rowan atkinson as mr bean will do in each episode. though lately at times it may show some of the repeats here, it never failed to bring back those childhood memories of mine. in fact, i can dare say this is the very first show which introduces me about the kind of shows which come out of the uk as i was growing up.the comedy series...definitely really wicked, as what the brits may be saying.

this is one of my favorite t.v shows of all time, rowan atkinson is simply a genius!, and it's only fitting that i chose this to be my 1000 review!. i can't begin to tell you how much i love mr. bean he's the man, and what amazes me, is how he gets out of these incredibly difficult situations, and he is always so creative,plus robyn driscoll also deserves accolades!, he is also a genius!. my favorite bit that he has done is the amazing adventures of mr. bean and while all the rest of them are amazing, this remains my true favorite, plus i wish the show didn't stop so soon!. each episode is brilliantly written, and they were all masterfully directed, plus each episode is a classic in my eyes!. this show is incredibly popular, and i can definitely see why, as it's quite possibly the funniest show ever. the character actors all played there roles really well, especially robyn driscoll and matilda ziegler (as irma). this is one of my favorite t.v shows of all time rowan atkinso is simply put a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (possibly the best!), and it's only fitting that i chose this to be my 1000 review f you haven't seen this show , drop what your doing right now and go check it out, you will not regret it trust me it's one of the best t.v shows ever!,and i will continue to watch the show over and over again, i never tire of it!, mr. bean rules!. ***** out of 5

the 1990s was a great decade for british sitcom with many popular creations such as one foot in the grave, absolutely faboulous the thin blue line, the brittas empire and men behaving badly arriving onto tv screens for the first time.however, mr. bean is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s.mr. bean represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton for several decades. it brings to the audience a single character - mr. bean - played to perfection by rowan atkinson.many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not mr. bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability. however, i believe this debate is unnecessary because i highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider mr. bean in such a context.mr. bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others. some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show. this is where the humour derives from. mr. bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. and naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see mr. bean try to resolve.sometimes, we see mr. bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it. but no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring.unlike most examples of british comedy in the past 30 years, mr. bean is simple, inoffensive, harmless u-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy. it is for this reason why the tv series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world. it is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other tv shows will have come, gone and been forgotten.some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet i laugh just as much at mr. bean's antics now as i did when i first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s. rowan atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time.the tv series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, bean and mr. bean's holiday. as one familiar with the type of humour shown in the tv series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen. the two movies do little justice to the tv series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes. the greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting. in both movies, the producers take mr. bean out of his normal british surroundings into america (the first movie) and france (the second movie). as a result, the movie characters around mr. bean respond differently to his behaviour than their tv series counterparts. both movies re-use gags from the tv series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. in the second movie, mr. bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny. at various times, i found myself thinking that the character i was watching was not mr. bean but a pale caricature. it is clear that rowan atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the tv series. his heart just wasn't in the performance. after the second movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play mr. bean again. i realise how he felt.returning to the tv series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies.my favourite episodes are the first three - these set the high standard that was to continue. i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless.to summarise, mr. bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family. rowan atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this tv series. my recommendation - watch and enjoy. but only see the movies if you consider yourself a die-hard fan after seeing the tv series.

because mr. bean almost never speaks, i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button. at the end of any age group's lesson, simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the dvd, encouraging students to shout out the answers to "what's this?", "what will happen?", "what's happening?", "what's wrong?", or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson's new vocabulary and grammar.because everyone's looking at the tv, normally shy students become vocal. because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point, it's a perfect "filler" for the awkward "between" times while students are leaving and arriving.i tried other dvds, notably "tom & jerry" cartoons and red skelton dvds, but no others were as good as "mister bean" at holding students' constant attention.

this tv series is about a foolish and unconventional english gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.i remember watching mr bean with my family back in 1990, when i was still a child. my family laughed so hard at every episode, and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later. the memorable scenes which are still in my head include mr bean attempting to get out of his car park, shooting out the lights, counting sheep, and him in the swimming pool. we bought all the mr bean videos on vhs, no mater how expensive they were. it was worth it because we watched them over and over again! it is so rare to see a very funny tv series that is suitable for all ages.

mr. bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy. he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. and mr. bean is one of those characters who you just can't forget. some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they're not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness. rowan atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when mr. bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof? mr. bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie wasn't as good as this, but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor. "extras" and "little britain" can be damned - this is british comedy at its best and most original. these escapades never get old! 10/10

as others that have commented around the web... i'm a 130 pilot in the coast guard. having said that, and being the skeptic i am, i went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. there was some cheese, but all in all, not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.i watched the trailer again today. after seeing the film yesterday, i've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. this isn't the case.the movie is truly more character/story driven than action. the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with.. kutcher's is revealed further into than movie than costner's is.of course, there is a minor love story.. no surprise there. but for the most part, the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together, and after some time, help each other heal old wounds.as girlie as it sounds, costner and, as much as i try not to like him, kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie.as critics have stated, you've seen it all before.. top gun, officer and a gentlemen, etc. but what movie hasn't been remade a million times.i can recall only one f word being spoken.. and can't really recall any other language.the movie is 2+ hours, and for some, may tend to get a little long towards the end.you'll laugh, you may cry, but i can honestly say, it was worth the $4 i paid.i hope you enjoy the movie.

rachel and chuck yoman (valerie harper, gerald mcraney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (gregory togel) and daughter (tammy lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child.they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a mayberry feel. later the residence seems to be more like the people in deliverance. soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces. this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods.we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get ax-cepted as the antagonists. can the ignored young stevie save his parents or will their pursuer(s) put his/her foot in it?this film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces. they could not have chosen better actors and daryl anderson was exceptionally creepy. an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out, instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact. anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs.

the premise of the story is common enough; average family wants out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life....so they move from sherman oaks,california to lake tomahawk; kids in tow.the lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house....but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (never mind why). gerald mcraney is excellent, a familiar face for lifetime viewers; valerie harper is also good; since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.you will also enjoy barry corbin as the town eccentric, and darryl anderson as a bruce dern-lookalike/crazed military man.while the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from ""psycho""; ""deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining; and better than, for example the more recent movie:""i know what you did last summer""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!.

this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. a big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round lake tommahawk i for one would not mind living there!all in all a great film to watch over and over again.

not a film of entertainment, but of real lives & limited ambition for the working class in 60's. enjoyable because of my upbringing, not sure it'd work for most people. typical loach. full of tv actors/actresses of 70's/80's/90's.

recently released on british dvd, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly). not as depressing as it could have been, this is kitchen-sink at its most dirty. terrance stamp is great in it, the music is sweet, carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals.my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye) sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past.the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carol's first husband, but if you can get past that, you're ok. and donovan provides some of the most languid, mellow, bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s.

one of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. fantastic views of london and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. as with 'kes', 'riff-raff' and 'sweet sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of britain. carol white is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope. well backed up by terence stamp, ( fresh off 'the collector', also catch 'the hit' ) and a plethora of english faces ( all looking very young ). pefectly set to donovan's dulcet tones. stamp sings 'yellow is the color', in a lovely scene, ending with him saying, " getting better, ain't i " ( song also used in 'the rules of attraction' - i think ) watch carol whites screen mum getting ready to 'go out and get a bloke', putting on her false eye-lashes to the sound of 'rosie' on the radio - priceless. a treasure for anyone who was around at the time and a reminder of how good life is now in england. incidentally soderburgh used clips from 'poor cow' in 'the limey'.

ken loach showed the world the down-and-out flip side of swinging london with "poor cow", about london woman joy (carol white) hooking up with a thief and having a son with him, only to see the man end up in the slammer. while his friend (terence stamp) manages to help her out some, he proves to be little better in what a loser he is. it soon becomes clear to joy that she's going to have to make a serious decision about where she's going in her life.one thing that i determined - i don't know whether or not this is accurate - was a use of irony in the movie. her name is joy, but she experiences no joy in her life. even if that wasn't intended, it's still a movie that i recommend to everyone. featuring songs by donovan (one of which - "colors" - appeared in another terence stamp movie: "the limey" (which, incidentally, came out in 1999, when i was as old as my parents were when "poor cow" came out)).

back in the 60's, this grim study of joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of ken loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected british filmmakers of all time. by then i knew very little about brecht, politics or the reality of the under-privileged, and i was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and joy's monologues in front of the camera. i was also much surprised to find that terence stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to "billy budd", "the collector" and "modesty blaise") had so little screen time. although 20th century fox distributed "poor cow" in panama, loach did not stay in mainstream cinema (which this film hardly is) and i lost contact with his films. i just heard of his successes, "kes", "family life", "black jack". until i caught up in the 80's. the beautiful title song by donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "troubadour".

i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere, which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film-noir, in the movie its first 30 minutes or so. it's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way, with the right camera angles and use of light. it doesn't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry. it's definitely a better movie than the average 'later' columbo movie entry.26 years after his previous columbo movie appearance, george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk, again as the murderer, in a total different and new role of course. i liked him in his role and he was a good columbo 'villain', who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition. they had some nice sequences together. problem with the 'modern' new columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn't feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk. this movie obviously doesn't suffer from this problem. but i must say though that this movie doesn't feature peter falk at this best. he has certainly played the character better and his performance isn't quite consistent enough within this movie, which is probably also due to he movie its director daryl duke, who also directed the really dreadful movie "tai-pan", among many other projects.it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also doesn't help of course. it got used before in the 1975 movie "columbo: playback". nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough 'original' moments of its own with its story, even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same. but oh well, that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent. if it ain't broke don't fix it.it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant, which doesn't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others. it doesn't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable, to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues. luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving columbo-comedy.simply a good late columbo movie entry.7/10

after being off the air for a while, columbo returned with some new made-for-tv mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s."murder can be hazardous to your health" used the then (and i guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. the murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, george hamilton (in a nice bit of casting). his chain-smoking nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by peter haskell, attempts to blackmail hamilton when he discovers a porno video hamilton made with an underage actress in his salad days. hamilton uses haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison, giving himself an alibi as well.columbo is brought in to find out what happened. you know the rest. highly entertaining.

this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. well written by shane black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director jack swanstrom. clearly, swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future. his strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.this thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense, and mystery. as with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie. the mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense. you find your self looking for the answers along with marquette. audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit - with many awards received, they must have agreed that a.w.o.l. (2006) is well worth watching. i'd love to own a copy - how do i go about getting one?

if you're into alternate realities, contemplating what's real and what's just a fantasy, this is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that'll keep you guessing and really make you think. try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! i watched it at an l.a. film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw. it helped that it was actually about something, unlike the others that were screened. it's very well directed and the production value is top notch. i would compare it to jacob's ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we're in. you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it's screening at any festivals near you, try to check it out.

i too saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original. in a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, a.w.o.l however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to "the outer limits." the performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film i saw. a.w.o.l is quite aptly written by shane black, who, as is usually the case, plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities, while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously. all in all a.w.o.l proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film.

excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values and a cool, action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. what a great short film! i saw this film in vail or aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. then i saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and i was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around - for a short film, this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.awol is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film - for any film actually. it's an interesting story told very well, and every scene moves the story, which reveals good film-making instincts went into making this film. the film looks gorgeous and david morse is also stunning, with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene. watching his character attempt to defeat the curveballs life is throwing him makes a great viewing experience.it also should be noted, that when tortures of war are in the headlines everyday, the lines between reality, good and evil, can get very gray while the rhetoric gets loud and attempts to make things black and white. awol smartly allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is, what is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery.both times i've seen it, the audience was way more into this movie than the others playing with it, which is saying a lot. there are a lot of shorts out there right now, but few deliver the kind of all around excellence and complex subject matter that awol does.it sounds to me like the previous reviewer is off his or her rocker, or has some personal agenda, because this really is a great example of short independent film-making. i see a lot of short films, and i must say if only all the shorts making the festival rounds were this good, then the shorts business would have some serious legs.

i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10.nonetheless it is a highly interesting film.judith ivey, playing a likable old floozy, should have been given the oscar for her performance.emily grace (portraying alice), whom i had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think i've ever seen on film.in a beat to heck old car, alice has lit out from the n.e. for florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, i'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the film's), and high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can't really afford.she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone, and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a hole in one of her tires.she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband, bill, an older couple who are traveling in an rv.they're going south, to florida, and take her under their wing, but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves? flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life.

"what alice found" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! i underestimated it when i heard of it, and i though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. they say all indie movies suck, but this one, and "napoleon dynamite" didn't suck. i asked my friend, who'd seen it before i did, and she said that alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that i remember, and little nudity. the movie did have a point, and it taught me never trust hitchhikers. i liked that in the end, they got alice a little dolphin in the end, on her way to flordia. i totally suggest seeing this movie.

fantastic film! wow - this is really a treat. i can't believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie. a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv, after she has a flat at a rest stop. however she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them.everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you.newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute, yet somewhat shy alice. emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film. i'm sure we'll be seeing emily in more films in the future.contrary to what some others have said, the lighting and photography in this were just perfect. the editing was done well too - just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip.i didn't see it on the big screen, but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it. more films like this are *exactly* what we need.sf

i wasn't expecting a whole lot when i rented this film, as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days (well, hollywood films too for that matter) but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's too bad it didn't reach a huge audience because it's just superb. i really love alice's determination, it really makes me look upon my life as a gift, and i see how privileged i am just to have an education. but all of that aside, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter what the budget, it's an excellent film and everyone should watch it, they will love it and definitely learn something from it. i don't have to be roger ebert to know it's one of the best movies i've seen all year, and certainly one of the most truthful.

this is most likely the best picture not many will see. it presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. a must see for all who like indie and for those who don't. i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene. the acting was top notch! the character of alice was portreyed so well. with perfect akwardness. this movie ahould be brought to the mainstream! i think it would do phenominally! alice is the most real look at an element of our culture that i have seen since go ask alice. a look that is untouched by the hollywood hand. movies like this show young people that these things aren't glamorous but that they are real and compelling. if you liked pieces of april you will love this one!

at the story. it is reality mixed with americana- and very original.emily grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in new england. her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. driving from new hampshire to miami, florida, is not a short trip, and her ford escort dies out. she then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by judith ivey and bill raymond. they have an rv and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road. especially i-95.emily grace is very realistic as alice, and initially lets the judith ivey character help her; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. at first it is a nice vacation for alice, who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend, who attends college in miami. there is interesting cinematography, as the trio drives the rv down to florida: the rest-stops, bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of north carolina.eventually there is something awry, and the ivey character apparently has fabricated stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister.i will not spoil the outcome of this film- but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense- this film reminded me a bit of spielberg's "duel"- while it was initially not as menacing- the moral of the story is - you never know what people are thinking- especially if you are driving cross-country. beware!!. you will enjoy this film.

judith ivey as the scamming old whore is awesome. emily grace the young girl. is innocent and exciting as she learns whats going down. excellent direction and camera. story is dark and disturbing.supporting cast is good. shows what happens and can happen with a run of bad luck. great independent film. small cast. pace is slow at first and then moves good. a good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early, for the open road and adventure. this movie, film has a low budget feel to it, but it works because of the low lifes and areas that these people move in. i will never stop a rest stop again with out thinking of this movie and checking my tires before i go.

i just saw this on cable. i liked it. it held my interest and the dramatic choices were good. the old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy. the cinematography is not so great, but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism, so its a trade-off, you know? at times the girl would hit the new england accent to hard. the accent would sort of come and go. anyway, i thought the film was well done overall, though. the storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on, even though things seemed mundane. good job on a low budget. another good suny purchase filmmaker. way to go.

a great performance by emily grace! i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character "alice" played by emily grace. the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not predicable. the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. i will purchase this dvd to add to my library. i am a new fan of emily grace and i high anticipate in seeing more from her performances.

the greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.from this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. death in venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.it confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director. the central performance, at once rigid, aroused, and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence highlights bogarde as if not the best british actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous. able to hold on to sympathy as his desires take him over and interesting despite the endless close-ups and mahler score playing above him not one for a friday night with your girlfriend but certainly ok if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.

a film to divide its viewers. just criticism points at its funereal pace, over-used snap zooms and persistent, lingering gazes between the protagonists. advocates point to dirk bogarde's mighty performance and pasqualino de santis' benchmark photography of venice.taken altogether, this might suggest an indulgent, romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at a time, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal). in fact visconti has succeeded in making a richer, more complex film than such a single-issue vehicle. he has knit his ideas - foibles and all - into a meticulously paced arc.inside this does indeed sit the central performance of bogarde's aschenbach. rather than a simpering, johnny-come-lately gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in tadzio. his mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob (and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback).mahler's music is possibly a little over-used although it is well appropriated. the italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting doesn't suffer too much. 7/10

his music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. from around the time of bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, wagner and then mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get. -of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo. wagner and mahler wrote music that is properly played at a snail's pace. given that the slowness in no sense sounds too slow "snail's pace" is the wrong expression. a critic wrote of a famous wagner conductor, "he doesn't beat time, he beats eternity." for all i know this was meant as a compliment.i get the feeling that around the early 1970s directors worked out how to make the slowest possible films: there's "death in venice", and there's "solyaris". i much prefer the former. for one thing, "solyaris" steps over the line, or some line, and becomes soporific; "death in venice" is gripping from beginning to end. not much happens, but it all happens in the right sequence, at the right pace, with photography you can get lost inanother way of cheating with music, by the way, is to write something that doesn't really have a tempo at all. such music sounds slow, but is really just unmusical, just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form. "death in venice" isn't one of them. beautiful in every respect, it will remind you of the timelessness and contextlessness of quality. you need no theoretical knowledge to respond to visconti's mastery, as you do to respond to a lesser director's incompetence. it's a great work.

i'm not sure where to start with this. in short, it was a disappointing movie. having taught the novella, i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. the movie has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between alfred and aschenbach) but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. for one, i was expecting an older aschenbach and a younger tadzio. in the book, tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease. he is an accomplice to aschenbach, he always looks back at him, almost provokingly. in the book, it is aschenbach who steals glances at the boy. as for aschenbach, i imagined something closer to the professor-turned-clown in the blue angel (based on a story by thomas mann's brother heinrich) than this forty-year old with hardly any gray hair. in all fairness, i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job, but either someone else should have done that, or he should have made to look older at the beginning. i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on aschenbach's obsession of tadzio and does not justify it. i liked the fact that mahler's music was used, because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story. i'm not sure turning aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book.and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips. i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian. but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem. it just bothers me because these directors (fellini is the other person i'm thinking of) are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema, and here are their characters laughing without sound, then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces (i'm thinking of the scenes when aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing. this scene could/should have been the strongest, but it was annoying instead).

i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made "the postman" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. but i was shocked. shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role. shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. not since 'robin hood' have i seen this costner: full of depth and complex emotion. kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in "butterfly effect". these two actors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films i've seen this year. no, its not an oscar worthy movie. it's not an epic, or a profound social commentary film. rather, its a story about a simple topic, illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible. that's what i think good film-making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work. bravo!

philistines beware, especially american ones! this has all the elements you'll hate - a langorous approach to film language, a painterly sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, even worse, it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well... if, however, you do feel that films don't to have derivative plotlines, be full of action and crappy dialogue, don't need the visual grammar of mtv/tv commercials, then watch this. it's one of my favourite films, and is perhaps visconti's most perfectly formed piece of work. it's sublime, like the movement of mahler he uses insistently throughout the film.

i saw this film many years ago, and absolutely hated it -- i could not wait for it to end, and would have walked out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. you know what? i have never forgotten this film, and more, i would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. how many movies have i wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse, then forgotten as soon as i hit the street, like ... you see, i can't even think of one! rarer are films like death in venice that enter your consciousness and work sea changes. the french like to say film is an art, and movies like this one prove they are right. i give it 10 stars, up from the 3 i gave it the night i saw it.

visconti's masterpiece! i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of his work but i cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film. last night i watched death in venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw. this captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: the extraordinary shots directed by visconte, primarily his love of long, languorous shots of people dining, swimming, walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people; the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of visconti's shot selection; the acting by the principles without over-riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone.it is true: young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film, a film that could not be made in 2006. a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money-men took secondary roles. as many of the recent imdb commentator's have written, this film, in their judgment, is long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. i suppose by the standards of hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years.please, if you have not seen death in venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time. you will be rewarded.

personally, i can only but agree with stephen-12: indulge. there's really no point in trying to 'capture' this film. i like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. herzog's 'aguirre, der zorn gottes' has got the same nothingness, though that movie is less convincing, since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story, so herzog had to focus on nature versus kinski. morte a venezia is wholly different though, since it has several climaxes, turns, etc. in fact, from the point where aschenbach's luggage is lost, the movie almost 'rushes' to its grand finale (his final grains of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment of bliss where he fantasises about warning the polish family and caressing tadzio's hair).you can, if you want to, seek some real clues/symbols in this one (his trying to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, the pointing tadzio at the end, the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in sinc), but there's no point in doing this: it won't make the film better or worse, since its force lies in the whole storyline's undertow, which is never made explicit. tons of history, decaying europe, the end of the 'romantic era' as we've come to know it, which has proven to be only the beginning of it (individual emotions & expression are more important now than they ever were). but wait, now i myself am beginning to develop the one minor (tiny) flaw of the film: the 'let's talk about art'-parts. now there's one thing never to do. i myself believe it could have been expressed by other means. furthermore, i believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the film.i don't like explicit films. i can read books, so i don't want a storyline that speaks merely to my rationale. i prefer films that you cannot explain in words, but only in film (lynch's lost highway, weir's picknick at hanging rock and roeg's man who fell to earth also belong in this category), for then, and then only, it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book. so what about thomas mann's novella? i've never read it, but forget about it! the movie gives a different point of view: it says things you can never say in a book. it uses the movie-art to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing that mann made you feel, using text. equally brilliant, but different worlds.

contains spoilersluchino visconti's film adaptation of thomas mann's novella is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (britten's opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian/dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer). it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made. in the visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. never has venice looked more beautiful and alluring, more decadent and effete. if you've read the novella, it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life. dirk bogarde gives an outstanding performance as gustav von aschenbach. although he has very little dialogue, he conveys the bitterness, aroused passion and finally, pitiful yearning of aschenbach through facial expressions alone. bjorn andresen, the young actor who plays tadzio, the beautiful object of aschenbach's desire, was perfectly cast. he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. the tadzio character is pivotal to the story, so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. and changing ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on gustav mahler, and then using mahler's music, especially the adagietto from the 5th symphony, was another brilliant stroke. although i'd read the mann story before the film, mahler's music and death in venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film, especially that last one of ashenbach dying on the beach as tadzio walks slowly into the sea. one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us.

from the first to the last scene of the movie, director visconti excels at his art, to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only god knows how long. it is perfection - as a movie, that is, but the story has some minor shortcomings.thomas mann's novel is also a perfect piece of art, so of course it is impossible to bring into another media. visconti follows the story pretty much, and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly, that the transition falters. and no matter how wonderful the scenery is, the tension in the air between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably heightened serving of mahler's music - still, the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me.maybe i'm just a victim of man's desire to flaw the flawless. nevertheless, i will offer one example, which i regard as crucial.warning: spoilersin mann's story, aschenbach eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him, after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy tadzio in venice. unable to catch one delight, he settles for another - which poisons him. it is very subtle in the book, but it is there. the forbidden fruit, of sorts, but more a sign of him surrendering life itself.in visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach. the chase in venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. it works, too, but lacks some subtlety, indeed, and also the multi-layered symbolism, giving food for thought.but that's all forgiven, when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries, faces and constellations, and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest - the last gesture of tadzio, standing in the water, being the equally sublime and mysterious finale.

it may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. the true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. bogard is amazing and needless to say that venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like bogard's soul. and classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings. in my opinion, a classic masterpiece of european film-making.

i can't quite explain why i find this so alluring and "the leopard" not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film, those intimate moments that visconti can render so magnificently. like that film, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it isn't overlong. it's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story. like "the leopard," it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos -- though bogard's performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable, especially in look: he has a really stupid grin that's easy to dislike. it's often quite beautiful in the quiet moments. it's the opulence of visconti's films, the grandeur of the ball scenes, that i find tedious, as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. but here, that is part of the point -- gustav surrounded by a visual din.the way in which the object of gustav's affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant -- the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful, feminine-featured boy. it's like an allusion to shakespeare's sonnets, and it doesn't feel heavy-handed. (it's not until the camera views tadzio fully, pulls back and we see his long, slender legs, that we realize he is not a boy, but an adolescent -- at first we're forced to question gustav's attraction in an uncomfortable way; visconti must have known that, and he doesn't shy away from it.) visconti is extremely patient with gustav; we get a sense of the man, we know him. it's a largely silent performance, and when he does open his mouth it's to spew venom; no wonder he wants the angelic, open-featured boy to project himself onto. there's a difference with tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of fellini grotesques; but that's because his life is another, its own film), but it's not as flirtatious as it's been made to seem (there is one scene, however, where he twirls around a pole that's too much). tadzio isn't necessarily leading him on -- he's looking at him; visconti just zooms in is all.the film doesn't detail gustav as being gay -- tadzio isn't even really male, he's a prettified version of a boy (delicate, pale, wispy, with golden locks) that everyone seems to love (including one gorgeous, slightly older young man who he wrestles with). the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene, which unlocks his repressed vanity.it isn't totally successful -- the whole section with alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people carrying bags in long shot, could have been excised. some parts are heavy-handed, such as when gustav's boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by -- the looks on his face are too obvious. (but during the same scene gustav throws a fit, wanting a new rower, something so unexplainable that it makes up for it.) but there are some scenes -- touching for the first time -- that build up a remarkable, quiet intensity. tadzio repeating a piano song again and again, the notes quivering in the air, may be the best example of the anxiety the film has. there is one discussion that contains a debate i'm especially interested: can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or does it have to go beyond them? (we can consider tarkovsky, who esteems both visconti and mann, to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations.) i think this one manages to do both. 9/10

in luchino visconti's film death in venice, it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays, but in the pursuit of beauty itself gustav von aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man. to understand the decay, we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us, it is best described, and explained in a quote from socrates found in thomas mann's version of death in venice, "beauty alone, is lovely and visible at once¬Ö it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses¬Ö else what¬Öif the divine, if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses? should we not perish and become consumed by love?" we see in the film this very thing happen, the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty, which turns into a longing for the boy, tadzio. even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon, he cannot contain himself. it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film; early on we see the extravagance of the parlor, and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turn-of-the century upper class life, all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer pasqualino de santis. but visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of venice. instead, the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty, and these things are relegated to the past. the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff. the streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot, the city decays in step with the protagonist. only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man. the death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. alfred, with whom aschenbach has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but alfred is more than a friend, he is aschenbach's alter-ego, and what alfred says articulates the composer's own doubts and fears. the scene in which aschenbach decides to leave venice is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling him that he is weak, alienated and lacks feelings. in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all. it is a decay of memory, rather than objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. we can say that these are decayed memories because even aschenbach alludes to it, he declares, "reality distracts and degrades us;" and, following the scene in the travel agent's office we see aschenbach confront tadzio and his family and warn them - leave venice, but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination, he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of gustav mahler. he allows the viewer's mind to wander as we watch aschenbach's life and respectability decay with the beauty around him. slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth. the crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man's attraction to tadzio, it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in fantasy. the beauty of this polish boy kindles a fire in him that, at first, makes him glow, then consumes him. the film concludes with von aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood, it is a vision of his life's expiring moments, though before his last breath. the final decay has happened, all around him the city is soiled, and with it he has become what he detests. as aschenbach dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film, a man that had disturbed him. it was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay, in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise, and that of the city around him; his sensuality is indulged in, while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay. it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in venice together, beauty, death, and decay, these themes are visconti's art, the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself. in this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man. we see the honored composer gustav von aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty, and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable, lonely death watching the target of his affection. i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last. decay is intrinsic in the world around us, and when we become distracted, it can destroy the splendor. in death in venice, it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted. beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in visconti's works, at once beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define his art.

story of a strange love and a fall desire. poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.a slice of visconti, mahler and mann. and an agonize venice. idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. it is, absolutely, a" memento mori". and a exploration of illusion. a old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. a trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. "death" is a orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality. and the essence is the music. a soft, sweet music, like honey or winter's fire. like every regret and every sorrow. like a refuge in deep solitude. gustav is gay by accident. he is the researcher of last form of god's presence. the beauty, that beauty who gives life's sense, who is sin and virtue in same time, the gift of expectations and sufferings. he dies because he has right to hope, to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way. a victim? no way! only tadzio may give the freedom like an insignificant sacrifice. who saw the sun can hope to live in same condition?

set in venice mainly on the lido, visconti's "death in venice" is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of dirk bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. for those who love venice, this is a film to cherish.mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. the mood it creates is not always happy. but then what else would you expect with a title like that?there is not a lot of dialogue in the film. rather sparse in fact. it's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests. the intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between gustav von aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and at odd unexpected places around venice. they seem to acknowledge each other's presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze.each viewer will have his own interpretation. the composer has lost a child of his own. is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved? is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare? could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece? who knows?from beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th century venice. the elegance of the ladies, the deck chairs on the sand, the children frolicking in their neck-to-knee bathing costumes, the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world. while some may think the pace is rather slow at times, the film has an overall gentle quality, but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings. be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending.

are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary "don't look now" depicts venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see "just married" with ashton kutcher and brittany murphy). having never been to venice i can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from luchino visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. having seen the movie i now wish i had gotten around to reading the thomas mann novella it's based on (which also inspired an opera by sir benjamin britten). since i don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition, i'm left wondering about aschenbach (dirk bogarde)'s obsession with young tadzio. is he a homosexual? a pedophile? or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? perhaps tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long, and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace. the film benefits from the ravishing music of gustave mahler, on whom aschenbach's character is clearly based. dirk bogarde gives a moving performance, and the movie is graced by the presence of silvana mangano, one of italy's great beauties, as tadzio's mother.

thomas mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film "a death in venice. " although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director luchino visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a composer. as such, the author/composer, gustav von aschebach (dirk bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. after a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. he decides to go on vacation to venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. however, while staying at the picturesque seaside resort, he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy, tadzio (bj√∂rn andr√©sen) who eyes him with curious interest and is immediately smitten by him. although gustav is captivated by the wondrous youth, he nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy's governess (nora ricci), while having to cope with a invading plague which seems to have infested the city. the movie dialog, like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist. in the end. the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy. their affair is never given wing, substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book, the film allows only the possibility of 'what if.' nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment's peace to obtain that which is forbidden, elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes. great story and a bogarde classic. ****

cinema's greatest period started in post-war europe with italy's neo-realist movement. during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, france's new wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. but in 1971, luchino visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work *death in venice*, which might as well be called *the death of europoean cinema*. after the sixties wound down, so did the great european filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats (coppola, scorsese, & co.). this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. and rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the visconti revealed here. he's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. the pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. "incidents" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos.we will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (thomas mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (visconti), one of the greatest actors in the lead role (dirk bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, gustav mahler's 5th symphony. taking full advantage of mahler's ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast, visconti changes the main character, aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even making bogarde up to look like mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.cinema just doesn't get better than this. i'll ignore the complaints from the ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful, dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. and what it's mostly about is suffering: romantic (capital r) suffering, in particular. as a suffering romantic himself, visconti knew whereof he spoke.[spoiler . . . i guess] if for nothing else, see *death in venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. meanwhile, off in the distance, young tadzio, the object of bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture. the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *death in venice* is a miraculous work of art. [dvd tip: as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece *the damned*, i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie. it's ostensibly in english, but the dvd's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of italian spoken during the film, anyway.] 

i first saw "death in venice" 1971) about 15 years ago, found it profoundly moving and often thought about it. watching it again few days ago, i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema. with hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography, the fine acting, and, above all, the mahler's music without which the movie simply could not exist."death in venice" is a stunning luchino visconti's adaptation of the thomas mann novella about a famous composer (in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably) gustav von aschenbach (loosely based on gustav mahler) who travels to venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. his search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. ashenbach (dirk bogard) follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him. the boy, tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you, enchants you, conquers you and makes you its prisoner. ashenbach became one of the prisoners of tadzio spellbinding charms. he became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. was it bless or curse for him? i think both. he died from unreachable, impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself. the last image ashenbach's eyes captured was that of the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light. nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about. if he could, ashenbach probably would've said, "i was able to witness one of the faces of perfection, i could not bear it but i was chosen to learn that it exists here, in this world and i can die in peace now because it did happen to me." unforgettable music, gustav mahler's haunting adagietto of his fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie. it reflects every emotion of a main character - it sobs, it longs, it begs for hope, and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die. i may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to "death in venice". i dare say that mahler's music is its main character - it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen. it sounded triumphantly when ashenbach returned back to venice, to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death. it sounded gloomy when he first entered venice from the sea. you can hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-loathing, worship and melancholy, but always - love that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts (literally). the movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer/writer/artist. we are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as achenbach was by the boy's mysterious charm.

brett piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film "experts." it is low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. i wish i could see more of irene joseph. good viewing fun. i bought the dvd and enjoyed it. the special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. i always enjoy brett piper movies, and if you liked this i recommend bite me, screaming dead and anything else he has done. i look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of ms. joseph. i simply cannot see why this woman hasn't been in more movies, as her acting is excellent.

i bought this dvd from walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical, crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. there isn't really any criticism to say about it... it's obviously low budget, but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun. it's very cool and entertaining.there's everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. and i'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie i've seen. it has it's own unique look, which i liked very much, that's why this film deserves credit. i look forward to seeing more of these awesome movies from "the scare master", brett piper, whom i've never heard before this one.the dvd menu is really creative with groovy music playing over it, so it's perfect just to keep it on when you're not yet ready to sit down and watch it. it also includes some special features, which are really interesting. but we never get to see the director or hear him in the commentary, must be shy. this comes out of edgewood studios in vermont, usa. i highly recommend it to all horror buffs, you'll love it!

in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously. the movie is called arachina, it has a no name cast and i do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films. i mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. so what does one expect? hitchcock?i felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously. the movie the oscar comes to mind, most of sylvester stallone's movies. the two leads were not hepburn and tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie. the woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot. the actor who played the old man was actually very good. the man who played anal retentive professor was no clifton webb but he did a god job. and the bimbo's for lack of a better were played by two competent actors. i laughed at the 50 cent special effects. but that was part of the charm of the movie. it played like a hybrid tremors meets night of the living dead. the premise of the movie is just like all giant bug movies of the 50's. a meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards terrorizing the locals. a meteor was the cause of the problems this time. i was was very entertained. i didn't expect much and i go a lot more then i bargained for.

ok, i am a sucker. i loved it. i had no expectations and had them all fulfilled. it was a terrible movie. i loved it. i have managed to wear out a dvd from over use. no one can understand my obsession. i can't either, to tell the truth. for those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise, but i asked the clerk at the video store if i could buy a copy and i could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me.now, the movie is terrible. the special effects are terrible. the acting is terrible, but i loved it. the actors are silly, the plot silly, the goofs numerous--like being able to see through the monsters, the "arachnids" looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was light underground, tnt wasn't deafening, etc...you must really love b-movies to get any enjoyment out of this...alcohol helps enormously for others.

this is a low budget stop motion monster movie from brett (a nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell) piper... and it delivers just what i'd expect from such a production: light-hearted (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. that's why i've given the film 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what i expected it to deliver... and a bit more: brett doesn't penny-pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen. he hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale. and, anyway, i love stop motion monsters which, compared to cgi critters in bigger budgeted movies, just seem to be that much fun to watch.

as is the case with many films of this ilk, my non catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. i found myself thinking, "that's pretty cool. why did they do that?" there's this casual thing in the robert langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. i suppose it's like watching csi where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. they know the lay of the land. in this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. but if you create robert langdon, you need to set him to work. that's ok because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. i thought the film was fun. i thought the da vinci code was fun too. interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second.

three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. as their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. nice-girl local teen joyce russel (lori lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.hearkening back to films like "the bad seed" and "village of the damned", this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. all three of the child actors - elizabeth hoy, billy jacoby, and andy freeman - are chillingly convincing. director ed hunt and his co-writer barry pearson maintain the unpleasant yet compelling mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to have the little girl charge admission for an unwilling peep show involving her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and mtv personality julie brown, whose striptease is a real eyeful).name actors susan strasberg, as an icy teacher, and jose ferrer, with barely any screen time as a doctor, add to the proceedings with their presence, while k.c. martel, one of the youngsters from the original "the amityville horror", is very likable as joyces' kid brother. other familiar faces like ellen geer, b-movie he-man michael dudikoff, cyril o'reilly ("porky's", "dance of the damned"), joe penny ('jake and the fatman'), and william boyett ("the hidden") can be seen as well.touching upon such parental fears as children playing with guns that they've discovered and being locked inside old refrigerators, "bloody birthday" is a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists. aided and abetted by arlon obers' music score, this film sticks in the memory more than some of its brethren, without lots of gore to fall back on (although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well).bleak, nasty, and downbeat, "bloody birthday" is worth a look for the curious.7/10

the ultimate gritty heist film. elements of bogie, welles & sinatra will leave you sweating & satisfied. in comparison, it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films, such as "oceans eleven (remake)", reviewed in such high regard-especially in europe. films like rififi must be shown, spoke about, and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics what true classic noir is.criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer.

story about three eclipse (maybe even indigo, ha) children beginning their love for murder. oh, and the people who are "hot" on their trail.bloody birthday, a pretty mediocre title for the film, was a nice lil surprise. i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood-thirsty psychopath kids. and i may say it's also one of the best flicks i've seen with kids as the villains. by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion.it's a really solid 80s horror flick, but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you can't not think about. even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh!ts as the murderers. but there seems to be only a couple police in town, well by the end, only one, and he seemed like a dimwit, so i suppose they could have gotten away with it. haha, yeah, and i'm a chinese jet-pilot.nevertheless, this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining, a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. no kiddin! if you're put off by the less than stellar title, dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot. it's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick.

bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. steven (andy freeman), curtis (billy jayne;credited as billy jacoby), and debbie (elizabeth hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). young billy, elizabeth, and andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. but they can't go on fooling everyone. this is an overall good horror flick, its not too unrealistic, there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well, (the grown-ups are pretty hammy though). i'd say its well worth seeing, (i own a copy myself).

this agreeably perverse and oddball early 80's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie "devil times five," but it's still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless.the slim, but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed, albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on june 9th, 1970. when the strange antisocial trio, who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle, reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless, unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful california suburb of meadowvale. writer/director ed hunt, the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey "starship invasions," the uproariously inane jesus christ vigilante parable (!) "alien warrior," and the stunningly silly "the brain," does a pretty solid and capable job here: the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty), there's a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex, a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained, some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem, and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting.moreover, the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing: jose ferror as a small-town doctor, future "jake and the fatman" tv series star joe penny as an amateur astrologer, "the prey" 's lori lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine, susan strasberg as a bitchy school teacher, "american ninja" 's michael dudikoff as a chowderhead jock, and cyril o'reilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy "dance of the damned") as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van. billy jacoby (who went on to star in such late 80's direct-to-video dross as "dr. alien" and "demonwarp"), andy freeman, and especially the eerily adorable elizabeth hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats. and, yes, that's none other than julie brown, the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune "the homecoming queen's gotta gun," as the lovely, vacuous, full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy, totally extraneous, yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song! all in all, this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item.

this movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. the reason they kill makes practically no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. and dang, these kids are crazy, especially curtis. if you've seen the movie, you know who i am talking about. that kid's vicous! although the movie doesn't have much gore, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. it also has some nice nudity. has some decent acting as well, really a decent 80's slasher movie, it's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it. you'll have nightmares about those darn kids though, i guarantee you!

brilliant and moving performances by tom courtenay and peter finch.

sorry about the "extremely clever" summary phrase. i don't know what i was thinking, but i really couldn't help myself.i've been meaning to see 'bloody birthday' for a long time and i must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. and believe me, i live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen. it's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. 'bloody birthday' is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays. not a masterpiece for sure, but still entertaining and guess what?... it doesn't really have unintentionally funny scenes. i know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people. but trust me, the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part.in 'blood birthday', the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse. according to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and the moon block saturn, which controls emotions. as a consequence, the three children who are born that day, eventually become uncaring and evil. since they don't experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever, these 10-year-old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way, including their own parents and siblings... and kill them! the body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place. in the meantime, debbie, curtis and steven, don't hesitate to keep butchering people, since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces (?)like i was saying before, 'bloody birthday' is surprisingly not funny. i know i said that before, but i'm truly surprised by this. i was expecting some hilariously bad scenes, but the movie proved me wrong. true, it's not exactly what most people would consider a 'serious' horror movie, but if i have to be fair, i'd say that the story is decently executed. one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations (like i did), it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children, the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable. let's face it: kids tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can't blame them for that. but to my surprise, the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film, looked very disturbing and not at all funny. the rest of the actors are also good and if you're a george clooney fan, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie. yeah, i know right?... who cares?. also, julie brown, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked. too bad she didn't have more time on the screen though! julie is 'absolutely fabulous':pso basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s. my only objection regarding 'bloody birthday' would be the way to justify the children's motives. this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. let's see: if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers, then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? i'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day... and during other days of total eclipse too, oh well!. overall, no big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. i've seen worse, trust me. take 'the children' (1980) for example, in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud. no, believe me, 'bloody birthday' is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers, you're going to enjoy this one very much.so, now you know: you're invited to the children's birthday party... and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. come on, you can't miss it ;)

three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them.while killer kid movies weren't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film. bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense, while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. it straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy, but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot. there's some strong murder scenes, as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure.the cast does a fairly good job. young stars elizabeth hoy and k.c. martel deliver some menacing performances, while rising star julie brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene. veteran star susan strasberg does well as the teacher and jose ferrer has a cameo appearance.all around this off-beat slasher entry isn't bad, though it's admittedly not flawless, but it is well worth watching for genre fans.*** out of ****

"saturday afternoon" is one of harry langdon's best-known short subjects, and with good reason. it is one of his funniest and best films. the plot -- such as it is -- is an old staple: a hen-pecked husband sneaks away for a night out with a his pal and a couple of other girls. it's a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is harry langdon himself. his slow, ineffectual, befuddled, innocent character has somehow floundered his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people must be ruled with an iron fist, and he is only thrust into cheating on her because he can't say "no" to the exhortations of the chummy vernon dent and the cute eyelash-fluttering of the girl. it's a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless, childlike character. harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. in a wonderful bit of comic business, he can't bring himself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye: he slyly pushes the kiss at her underhand and ashamedly wipes off his hand as if to chastise it. the film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two-reelers harry langdon had previously been starring in for mack sennett, with no more plot. perhaps it was even designed to be a two-reeler. this works beautifully, since it gives him as much time as he needs to inject the slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half-actions where so much of his comedy lives. he's at his best here, and the show is really harry langdon's curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing. his little half- smiles, his look while handling the money he has hidden under the rug, childlike attempts to enter the fight at the end. i think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us, yet at the same time, by allowing us to understand what harry does not (such as the fact that the women he good-heartedly brings to his friend to cheer him after he thinks the date has been blown are in fact whores) he forces his to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore. his comedy is just as capable of making us audibly say "awwww" as it is making us laugh, often at once. here harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife, he wants to tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship, he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film, but he just can't affect his surroundings that much, and sometimes we all feel like that. the film is perfectly directed by frequent langdon director harry edwards; it moves at a quick pace and never stalls while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect harry langdon's still, reactive comedy. vernon dent, a frequent foil to langdon, plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with harry. the gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too, and harry gets his own version of a lloyd or keaton style stunt at the end. here the comedy is not in harry's big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars, but in his slowness to take it in. this is a hilarious film, and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented humorists that i know ever to have existed.

if (as i just pointed out in the goat) keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this langdon short (the last released before he did tramp, tramp, tramp) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. laurel & hardy did this in several films, as did fields, and chaplin. i have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women? and there is an interesting sociological side issue - why don't you find female comics married to male counterparts to these shrews? i can't recall any, except in a carol burnett skit, where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get (a kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also reassurance that their not married to a namby-pamby type). as for the fact that the comics do marry shrews, i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve. or do they? ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him? yeah he went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans, but he wanted to get some private time - there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives. actually he is creamed by mae busch because he lied to her while stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife.here harry's wife (alice ward) is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control. we see harry at his job (it is saturday morning, and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - this was before the idea of a five - day a week, 40 hour a week job in industry). he works in a foundry where he hits red hot metal into shape (an early joke about langdon - he is a small, light man, not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer). he just misses his streetcar trying to give a man a light. he calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late. on the way home harry meets his pal steve (vernon dent) who has met two nice, sweet girls who would just love to have a date. harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the hot-dogs for the foursome - he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket). but his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden "cache" of coins. he keeps it hidden under the living room rug, and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug. but his wife spies on him, and confiscates all of it. later she overhears him talking to himself and berating her. in contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a soda.but harry has a second cache of coins, and dresses up for the date - and goes out. he and dent are apparently late, and dent blames harry, but harry tries to make it up to him: he produces two prostitutes. they get into a quarrel when dent (wisely) says they are not the type of girls he'd term as "nice". eventually the girls do show up and the date begins. but soon harry is hiding in the rumble seat, as his wife drives past in her roadster, and the girls boy friends turn up - angry at their two rivals.the short works well and is amusing, and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master. he is constantly put upon by others. he misses his streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light, and in the end the stranger gets his own. the nice girl who is harry's date has a little dog who chases him away. he rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole. it certainly demonstrates that langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time that he made his features. if only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features.

harry langdon's "saturday afternoon" is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies, at least where short subjects are concerned, and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some. unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keaton's "cops" or chaplin's "the immigrant" this film is in some respects a familiar, conventional situation comedy and doesn't offer much in the way of belly laughs; one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company. nonetheless, in my opinion, it's a perfectly charming comedy in its minor-key way, and harry is fascinating to watch.for a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of "saturday afternoon" may suggest the honeymooners or its many spin-offs: two dim guys, one of whom is married and very much under his wife's thumb, try to sneak out with a couple of good-time girls for a fun afternoon; but everything goes wrong, and they wind up having to fight the girls' tough guy boyfriends. does this sound familiar? and perhaps a little dreary? well, the premise was already shopworn when this film was made, but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical. he was odd, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby who was half asleep. any freudians who catch "saturday afternoon" will have a field day with the scenes between this timid, pudgy-faced baby-man and his stern, gently domineering mommy-wife. when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over, you'd swear you're watching an interaction between a 6 year-old boy and his mama . . . and maybe that's why harry langdon gave some people the creeps, and still does.but he's a compelling screen figure, and it's not what he does so much as the way he does it. in that scene with the coins under the rug, for instance, harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other, carefully, like a tightrope walker, counting off his paces until he finds the right spot, and his technique is hypnotic. langdon moved like no one else. whether or not he makes you laugh, the guy is mesmerizing, seemingly in a world of his own. where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive, and almost never drives the story forward himself. in the finale of "saturday afternoon," when the big fistfight is taking place, harry's co-star vernon dent is in the thick of the action, but harry is in a daze for much of the time, and winds up sort of punch-drunk between two cars (sitting on the running board of one, but with his feet on the other) while they race through the streets. it's a memorable image, and, as the critic walter kerr wrote, it encapsulates langdon's screen persona quite perfectly: he's a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action, blinking sleepily while the world rushes past. it's also worth noting that langdon and dent, who worked together frequently, have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel & hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later. langdon's style was a likely influence on stan laurel, especially here."saturday afternnon" and its star may not be for everyone, but the film is well worth a look, and you might find that langdon makes an impression that's hard to shake.

i enjoyed some of the older doctor who many years ago, so when the new one came out, i just had to check it out. i was so pleased - with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, i became hooked! from season 1 (27 for the old fans) through to season 2 (28), it just keeps on getting better. it ties in nicely with the old shows too, although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version.even though there has been a change of cast, i highly recommend doctor who - with chris eccleston and with david tennant.i like that they've given the characters so much depth. the doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, maybe because he is the last timelord. the range of emotions which chris and david show are truly remarkable, and i felt their pain, anger, and sense of adventure right along with them. billie piper (rose) brings a very human element to each episode, although she is much braver than i would be. with her talent, billie will go far in the industry.

for those with access to the bbc or the cbc, this has proved to be spectacular. like battlestar gallactica, this is a show rebuilt from the ground up. but in the case of dr who, they saved the best parts. i can't believe i am saying this but.. this is by far the best dr who. this has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show. the acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. the new doctor is easily the equal of the great tom baker, and the writer (former qaf lead) seems to have made even the minor characters come alive.i know...i'm gushing..but this should be on everyone sci-fi geeks list. i just don't know why it hasn't made its way here.. whatever you do...if you ever loved dr who or sci-fi..see this!!!

one of the most successful shows in television history is back. now i admit i never got into the original show.... okay, so i never watched it at all. but the new show is impressive.sci-fi has premiered the first two episodes, "rose" and "the end of the world," this weekend. we meet rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor. using the internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes, death follows. when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor, the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters, whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time, traveling in a tardis disguised a 50s-style police call box.she helps him save the world--there wouldn't be a show otherwise--and decides to join him. but when he puts her life in danger, he is distraught, and questions whether her company was worth the risk.although the special effects are kinda lame, and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy, "doctor who" is (after two episodes aired in the us) a smart, well-written work. apparently, the second season has already aired in the uk, so i predict the same success here.

russell t davies has been tasked with re-creating a slice of my childhood: hiding behind the sofa, watching scary monsters battle with dr who. he, and his crew, are clearly all true devotees of the original series.in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene rodenberry's original concept far more believable, russell t davies has both money and the advantages of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever. i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared.the accompanying series dr who confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight. interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again.how does david tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors? time will tell but tonight, seeing billie piper play alongside elisabeth sladen, who was the doctor's companion in the 1970's confirm that she has both the acting ability, screen presence and script to be the no. 1.

if you're a long-time fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. the pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. the writing is excellent, the acting superb. the hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. compared to the original, it's got some now. (although i will always have fond memories of bubble-wrap and hand-puppet monsters.) if you're not a fan, or if you tried the original and couldn't get a handle on it, jump in with both feet now! everything you really need to know about the doctor, they'll tell you as they go along. this series was written with minimal references to the doctor's enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers. admittedly, i'm only seeing the first new series now as it's being shown on the sci-fi channel (in other words, probably cut to ribbons for time constraints), but i'm looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd. (july 4th can't come soon enough!)

i seriously enjoy dr who.seriously, don't just dismiss me as a "sci-fi person", because i'm not normally. i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it. it is actually really funny, and more often than not, it's fast-paced. all of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle.christopher ecclestion is pretty good, but david tennant is brilliant. i think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character again.i don't know what it is about it, but everything manages to work like clockwork. all i'm going to say is just try it. one episode (probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two-parter, though).

it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it " bigger and better " but i'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - rumours . but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - christopher eccleston . yes that christopher eccleston an actor i've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true . as the months passed more and more information was leaked , billie piper was being cast , the daleks would be returning and the mill , the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show . for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series , massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show , tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter , mastermind ( which had a special doctor who night edition ) , this morning and friday night with johnathan ross . in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television , it had better be bloody good so was it bloody good ? undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts . to give you clue of its rating success only one episode ( the ark in space episode two - febuary 1975 ) from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart . the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there's far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice . let's laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time , celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and dec's saturday night takeaway . of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role . for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you'll see in a spielberg / hollywood movie . there's a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands , exotic aliens , a 19th century cardiff that looks like a 19th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen . i promise you'll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series , joe ahearne especially will one day be in the hollywood a list there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies . it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not ( in my opinion they're not ) but what's not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd . as i mentioned in my review of casanova he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here: when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor bellows " attack plan delta " which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot , a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he's been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings . in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the " bad wolf " is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor . and of the endings i'm trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor ? more often than it's a supporting character or the doctor's companion who saves the day . the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series ? one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he's written as a grinning loon . eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he's absolutely breath taking at scenes when he's showing grief , like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he's written as a " tom baker on speed " character . it's obvious why eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career - he's not very good at it am i starting to sound like i hate this show ? sorry i didn't mean to but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven't and they're nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who . let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s , imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe ahearne ! oh and one last request - can we see these " next time " trailers scrapped ? they reveal all the best bits of next week's episode

i never saw doctor who before (at least not in any focused way), so i was new to the concept. i have to say that the new show works very well. it's funny (it really also ought to say "comedy" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. the human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current tv shows.i've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far. even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel, saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here.christopher eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, i'll be quite surprised. but i'm willing to give the new guy a chance. there's little doubt, however, that the eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics.the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing. the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest, and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them, which however is much more emotional and human than sexual.a good show. the biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. and why they don't simply use some cheaper effects, i don't know. in this day and age, sfx don't have to cost a bundle - just look at the star wars: revelations fan film.8 out of 10.

i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid, waiting for dr. who. i thought it was the best show ever made. then, i grew up, dr. who went off the air, and no one i knew had ever heard of it. then i found out there was going to be a new series. i was a little nervous about it. was it going to live up to the expectations i had carried around since i was little? would they screw it up? would the dr. suck? would his assistant suck? would they create a more intimate relationship with the dr. and his assistant? yes, no, no, no, no!!! this show is wonderful!! i love the new dr. i love his assistant. i love the show. and i find myself excited on friday nights now, waiting for the "new" episode. i'm just now seeing 2005 episodes, as i live in the states, so i'm a little behind the rest of you. i hope the next dr. is as great as this one!

there was a time when not all animation was disney or pixar. its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good, reasonable copy on dvd. be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.i got a very good copy by a company called flashbacks and its quite good. in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in colour. very much better than some would have you believe. the songs are delightful and the colour is great. interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies. i loved hoppity and the villain mr beatle is a real cad. its incredibly imaginative. the way inanimate objects like cotton reels, old tins become part of the environment and have new functions is great. the anthropomorhic use of insects is amazing considering the much malinged creatures most people sadly think are repugnant. hopefully we may never step on an insect again! the insects enemy is man. in reality of course its the insects that will survive. no matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in australia they keep coming back. the battle has been lost and we have to live with them. there are several scenes that stand out such as when hoppity and mr bumble are caught in a watering can, the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful. its also rather anthropomorphic but in a way thats charming. the human characters look very like the ones in gulliver and its incredibly effective. the wedding scene looks beautiful. its a crime this movie has not been hailed as a classic. the only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse. speaking verse spoils the narration and it was no needed, the verse is awful and spoils an other wise good script. its great and kids will love it. its a joy to look at. there's a very clever ending too.

normally i am a typical "creepy-crawly-hatin'" girl, but after watching this film (on youtube of course), i'm having different perspectives. and also i did not know that my favorite animation studio - fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc.), and how a plucky young grasshopper named hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of honey the bee; i love the lovely ms. honey. you know, after watching the film, the bugs reminded me of the some of the "jitter-bugs" from don bulth's thumbelina. and out of the songs in the film, i love "we're a couple in the castle;" when i sing that song, it almost made me cry.this wonderful film was the second (and final) feature to come out of the fleischer studio. the film was originally going to be released on november of 1941, but since the fleischer's rival, disney, released dumbo weeks earlier, paramount changed the date to december of the same year, but mr. bug unfortunately went into a, then unrealized, trap of terrible timing. having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on pearl harbor, mr. bug was a financial disaster and led to the ousting of max and dave fleischer, from the studio they had established in 1919, and reorganized the company as famous studios. another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes (how sad it was). overall i love both films from the fleischer bros. - gulliver and mr. bug.

people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films.to be fair, those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well-done animated films, such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer.you may be thinking to yourself, "well if it's so great, why haven't i heard of it?" fair question. this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor. the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity. things are looking up, though, because it has finally been released on dvd under the title "bugville".it's funny that the film went through all this, because it kind of mirrors the actual plot. although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), i personally think that the movie's main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times (after all, the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time).our grasshopper hero, hoppity, desperately wants to help his endangered community. problem: each time he tries, whether through the ill-will of others or through simple bad luck, he fails miserably...and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he's trying to save. although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook, he occasionally breaks down and it's only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight. just a healthy reminder that, when all is said and done, no one is really self-sufficient."okay", you're saying. "it has a good message (two actually). does that really make it exceptionally well-done?" my answer: partially.it's not just the message that makes this movie special. it's the characterization. this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation. you almost don't even need the spoken lines. a good way to sum it all up is "energetic" or "lively". a lot of movies have used the selling point, "lovable cast of characters". whenever i hear that line, it always makes me think of this movie.case in point, the bad guys: swat the fly and smack the mosquito. many movies have "lovable" villains, but i don't think you'll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows. forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s. swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly (but sadly not larry) that you'll ever find. virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome. yeah, they're rotten no-goodniks, but you still care about them. that's the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer, director, and crew.the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes (native americans and chinese). i don't think they were intended to be malicious; but they're there, regardless. they didn't bother me, but it'd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them.so, if you share my weakness (and i think you do), give this one a go.

when hoppity goes to town he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the lowlands. can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart, miss honey bee, from the machinations of the evil c. bagley beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late?while not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this film was created) hoppity is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality. the movie's main drawback is that none of the characters really have any `heart' - they don't come `alive' on the screen in the way jiminy cricket did a year earlier in pinocchio.however, it is ultimately unfair to compare the fleischer studio output with that of disney. max & dave fleischer had their own star to follow; their contribution - and it would be a considerable one - would be in the realm of the one-reel cartoon. with their popeye and betty boop series they created alternate realities as viable as any produced by other cartoon studios. hoppity was their second experiment with feature length animation (after gulliver's travels in 1939), and henceforth they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject. in fact, the first in the highly acclaimed superman series was already in release.hoppity's story owes a great deal to frank capra, with it's energetic, go get ¬ëem hero up against powerful societal forces. indeed, the film's original title was mr. bug goes to town, which immediately puts one in mind of gary cooper or jimmy stewart and their capraesque adventures.jack mercer, famous as the voice of popeye, here speaks for two very different characters, old mr. bumble & swat the fly. movie mavens should be able to catch veteran voice actors pinto colvig & mae questel, both in uncredited roles.the film has some pleasant songs supplied by hoagy carmichael & frank loesser, of which `be my little baby bumble bee' is the most familiar. `we're the couple in the castle' is a fine romantic tune which deserves to be rediscovered.it is unfortunate that the film's initial animation, with its sweep out of the heavens and past the in-depth new york skyline, is obscured behind the opening credits.

well, i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a dvd copy as a birthday pressie for my dad. the film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the disney store!!!). the characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of swat, the fly. and smack the mosquito), and the amazing night club scene. the musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it. there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby-sitting, and in fact every child i know (thanks to my hoppity loving parents) have seen this film, many times. it will always get top marks for its fabulous love story, a brilliant baddy and over all originality.

"mr. bug goes to town" was the last major achievement the fleischer studios produced. the quality of the superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film.the music and lyrics by frank loesser and hoagy carmichael (with assistance by flieshcer veteran sammy timberg are quite good, but not as much as the scoring of the picture by leigh harline who also scored snow white for disney. harline's "atmospheric music" is superb, and a treat for the ears.the layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time, and once again the fleischer's background artists outdid themselves. the techincolored beauty of the film cannot be denied, and while hoppity the grasshopper is the star, the characters of swat the fly and smack the mosquito steal the picture. swat's voicing by jack mercer (of popeye fame) is priceless. kenny gardner (brother-in-law) of guy lombardo...and a featured vocalist in his band...does his usual pleasant job in the role of dick dickinsen.the movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons. the fleischer studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product. the movie is tuneful, the story great for all ages, and the final scenes of the bugs scrambling for their lives upon a rising skyscraper is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present.do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film. also don't fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of max fleischer's remarkable 3-d sterioptical process which took four months to construct and employed 16,000 tiny panes of glass in the "electrified" buildings of manhattan.do not miss mr. bug goes to town...aka hoppity goes to town. i'll wager you'll be bug eyed at the results!

hoppity is a charming if slightly phycadelic animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well. now i have to admit i have a soft spot for 'hoppitygoes to town' (as it is called in the united kingdom) having watched a vhs version taped of the tv by our parents many times with my siblings.imagine my surprise when i woke up this morning just in time to catch it on channel four (at 0615 never the less!) the film was just as delightful as i remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to parents and children alike. maybe one day i to shall share this forgotten classic with children of my own. with a nice running time for kids (88 min's)and a simple yet involving storyline there really is something for everyone in this tale of the little guy coming good. i really could see this being successfully remade in cgi. take note pixar.

what i liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. it's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. you feel like you've stepped back into time.from reading some of the reviews here, i see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack. wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, i'm sure. too bad, because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then, almost 70 years ago. the colors are nice, drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by "hoppity" and and his beautiful girl "honey" to make it happily-ever-after and out of harm's way. it's also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling them.there is a nasty villain, though - "c. bagley beetle" - and two of his henchmen. those helpers ("swat, the fly" and "smack, the mosquito") are comedians, complete with their brooklyn-ese accents! the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand. the good guy, meanwhile, has the decked stacked against him but in the very end, of course, prevails.my favorite part - this will sound worse than what it was - was when good-guy "hoppity" got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black-and-white. that was fantastic animation! you know, it's a good thing i didn't see this as a very little kid; i would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bug-people! you never know what (or who) is in that grass beneath your feet!

i have viewed this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grand-father. it is my favorite cartoon. i love the characters, the great little tunes, and the very good drawings. i totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon. i think it is a beautiful little cartoon. everyone i have shown it to simply loves it. it is too bad it opened on such a bad day (pearl harbor bombing). if it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success. i hope i can find a dvd of it because all the vhs tapes don't do it justice.i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result. they will just love it.

hello again, i have been thinking about this movie all my life. i saw it when i was 5 years old in los angeles, california in 1942. what a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. you forget it is the bugs relating to one another. it was just as if they were people. i love this movie and so do my adult children. such beautiful color in this movie.i need to see this movie again. there is a story about an envelope in the movie, that i just can't remember the "why" of it.thanks for listening.

i have for years remembered a song "just a couple in a castle" ("no. twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air"). i couldn't find the song, but i remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs. i located a reference to the movie on the web. i had seen the movie when i was only 9 year old at the ligonier pa theatre. i was pleased to find that it had kenny gardner the singer with guy lombaro (i am a lombardo fan). and then to see that it was produced by the fleisher bros. who did another very good full lengh cartoon feature of "gullivar's travels" (also remembered fondly). also the songs were associated with hoagy carmichael and frank loesser who are among the very best. no wonder i remembered the film, the song, and the colorful animation. as a full lengh musical this is a movie which should be remembered as a one of the best of the early full lengh musicals. now that i remember it, the plot may not have been earth shaking, but was very well presented and makes for a easy to watch abd delightful movie.

mr. bug goes to town was one of those films that i grew up hearing about, however a copy could never be obtained until now. i just watched this film on dvd and thought it was a delightful and charming film, with wonderful animation, a good plot and great songs. if this film was made by disney then the film would be considered a classic, however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone, the film has slipped through the cracks.the film was made by the max fleischer studios at their miami, fl studios and was released through paramount pictures. the film was to have had its premiere on dec. 7th, 1941, the date of the bombing of pearl harbor. though this probably did hurt the release of the film, the film did play at some movie theaters for up to a year as evidenced by doing some research. the film was called a family favorite by most of the major american newspapers. the film continued to be re-released about every year or so, usually around holidays like easter, at least in major cities.in the mid 1950s, this film was re-released under a new name "hoppity goes to town," named after the lead character in the film.the film is a true period piece, capturing a slice of americana as it was back in the late 30s and 1940's. the animation is great, and many of the characters are very cute. the animation of the humans in the film is via the rotoscope process, meaning that actors were filmed and then that footage was traced over by animators, giving the movement a very real look.the fleishcher studios were one of several animation studios making animated cartoons back in the 30s and 40s. while some of the fleischer characters like betty boop, popeye and the superman cartoons are better known, the work of the studio is more or less forgotten.almost as a whole the body of work of the fleischer studios are in the public domain. all of the superman cartoons are public domain, all but one of the "color classics" series are public domain, and the film "gulliver's travels" is also in the public domain. this film never appears to have been released in the us on vhs or dvd but was released in europe. however some looking around on the internet can very quickly produce you with a copy. i recommend the search.

i first watched this in black and white, circa christmas in the early sixties, when it was shown on british television. i was absolutely hooked, and watched it over again whenever it was repeated on tv (possibly two or three times only, as it happens - if only we'd had video recorders then!).as outlined by other contributors, the plot describes the return of hoppity the grasshopper, after a period spent away, to a forties american city. he finds that all is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the 'lowlands' just outside the garden which belongs to a songwriter and his wife) are now under threat from the 'human ones', who are trampling through the broken down fence which prefaces the property, using it as a shortcut.insect houses are being flattened by their feet, and are also often burned by cast away cigar butts and matches. old mr bumble and his beautiful daughter honey (hoppity's childhood sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their honey shop to this threat.to compound their problems, devious insect 'property magnate' c. bagley beetle has romantic designs on honey bee himself, and hopes, with the help of his henchmen swat the fly and smack the mosquito, to force bumble to give him her hand in marriage.will the heroic and fearless hoppity win the day, and manage to save the community of bugs from their dastardly fate, and especially his precious honey from hers? enjoy the classic songs ("katy did, katy didn't" is a superb, swinging, upbeat example), and the colourful visuals, as the tale unfolds.time has not blunted my fascination for this masterpiece of animation and story-telling, and i was much pleased to find that it had been released to video, although i later found out that it was in ntsc pal format. never mind, i sent off for the video immediately, and only then bought a portable tv/video combination (complete with ntsc playback).i have enjoyed many nostalgic viewings since then, and have even discovered that the tv rights have switched from bbc (who informed me they were unlikely to ever show the film on any of their stations) to filmfour, who have (at last!) been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007.my granddaughter (aged three) was absolutely entranced while we watched it together - and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer-generated productions!i would thoroughly recommend this film for any age, and especially the youngest of viewers.give max fleischer a posthumous oscar!

leslie carbaga's excellent book on the fleishers tells the whole story of the fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to florida, and their subsequent ejection by paramount. mr. bug goes to town didn't destroy the animation pioneers' credit with paramount, although it's often told that way, and this was paramount's favorite version of the story. according to carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether. mr. bug provided them the pretext to do just that. --the sad closing of a great quirky, innovative chapter in american animation.i wanted to comment, also, that the film actually debuted december 4, 1941, not december 7. that may have been close enough to do the trick, anyway, in terms of national mood damaging the film's success. but another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time dumbo (released october 23, 1941) was still doing very brisk holiday business. i haven't done the research into box office numbers, but i'd say that dumbo's concurrent presence in theaters likely had an impact on mr. bug. movie-going was at an all time high at this period, and successful films could go strong in theaters for months. -- something unimaginable in these typically short-run, quick to-dvd days.

"hoppity goes to town" was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave fleischer, who created a parallel universe to disney. while disney's films are well remembered today, both of the fleischer films "gulliver's travels" and this one are forgotten."hoppity" is a spellbinding original, not an adaptation like the first picture. that is a major plus, one would think. no, the critics, rarely on the fleischers' sides to begin with, tore into them for this. yes, the story is not as tight as "gulliver", but how can you hate a film that flaunts itself so joyfully?it is filled with great musical numbers and a very involving story, which would be a crime to reveal. the characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this film.the fleischers' really outdid themselves here and never quite did so again. most of their time would be devoted to one-reelers after this tanked at the box office. it's a shame they didn't continue making features. who knows? their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming for.**** out of 4 stars

a pity, nobody seems to know this little thriller-masterpiece. where bigger budgeted movies fail, "terminal choice" delivers lots of thrills, shocks and bloody violence. a little seen gem, that deserves being searched for in your local video shop. that anonymous guy beneath is quite right, when he says, you'll never trust hospitals again... it is that effective ! good ending,too, not really a twist, but it doesn't end the way one thought it would. yep, that's ellen barkin in an early role...

could this be one of the earliest colour films? it's actually the second. this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison. this was one of many of his other films.i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films. it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around, which turns red with the film. it's just beautiful.you are watching history when you watch this. you are watching what began to make movies of the day great! this may not have a plot, or anything very interesting, but this is the second colour film ever.i recommend this to everyone, especially if you're teaching students about filming or something of the sort, you have to show them what began color films!

like all of the very earliest films, this "movie" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! so, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. but, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. i've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout. i think the red one depicted on the dvd "the great train robbery and other primary works" is the best of them. the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art. and, unlike other one minute (or less) films of the day, this one is one i could see repeatedly--it's just that visually compelling and odd.if you want to see it online, there is a 36 second version on google video (type in "serpentine dance").

in this approximately 34-second thomas edison-produced short, we see annabelle moore performing the loie fuller-choreographed "serpentine dance" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.moore was one of the bigger stars of the late victorian era. she was featured in a number of edison company shorts, including this one, which was among the first kinetoscope films shown in london in 1894.loie fuller had actually patented the serpentine dance, which moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era. supposedly, the moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone (including refilming). the version available to us now may be a later version/remake. moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in new york city. she later went on to star as the "gibson bathing girl" in the ziegfeld follies in 1907. she appeared there until 1912.the short is notable for its framing of motion, which, especially during the "second half", becomes almost abstract. it somewhat resembles a morris louis painting, even though this is almost 60 years before louis' relevant work.you should be able to find this short on dvd on a number of different anthologies of early films.

i was surprised, "once more, my darling", had not generated enough votes (at this writing) for a "user rating". it's a "screwy" comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years. robert montgomery's mission places him in some very improbable situations, and he's just the man for the job. he maintains his trademark "befuddled" look throughout the film and hysterically, too. ann blyth plays his precocious/eccentric pursuer, who assumes a relationship that does not exist. her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname "killer", but remains cute and cuddly.among the glut of "b" movies from the late 1940's and 1950's, "once more, my darling" is a standout. this one is worth looking for....

this is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. it is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing, embedded in the marvellous array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score, and witty, light direction from montgomery himself. this is one to watch over and over. montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau, a suspected jewel thief. while the premise is rather preposterous, the results are hilarious. montgomery is the befuddled plant, ann blyth is a marvel as the romantically obsessed, terribly earnest debutante and the parade of comic characterizations from veteran stage actress, jane cowl's lawyer mother to lillian randolph's take-charge maid - are all fabulous.oddly enough this only earned an oscar nom for sound, when it deserved top nods for direction, screenplay and musical score.do not miss it - it's one of hollywood's best.

i like the good things in life as much as anybody, i suppose, but until about five years ago, opera didn't figure into my entertainment choices. oh, i made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about; i'd watched several television productions -- notably parts of wagner's ring cycle on public television -- hoping to understand other people's fascination with the art form. and i knew i could like parts of various operas (i remember being surprised as a kid that i actually liked the snippets of "madame butterfly" in "my geisha, and i enjoyed the opera scenes in "moonstruck" and "pretty woman"), but unlike the characters in those films, i just didn't "get it."then in 1995 i saw a live performance of "rigoletto" presented by the new york city opera company, and that night i "got it." what a wonderful, glorious pageant of color and music and raw emotion! and i do mean emotion with a capital e! the key, i think, is that the operatic music allows the performers to over-act freely and believably in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken. everything hinges on the music, of course, and when the music is magical, as it is in "rigoletto," an opera can be a magnificent entertainment.a sympathetic family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 tv production of the opera, and i've found that since i can't see live performances of "rigoletto" live on a regular basis, this video version is a fine substitute. luciano pavarotti is perfect in the part of the duke; ingvar wixell is excellent as his mean-spirited court jester rigoletto; and rigoletto's beloved daughter gilda is played by the somewhat plain-featured edita gruberova. the sets and costumes are lavish, and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a heightened sense of drama to the story that could never be matched on a stage.if you've never seen "rigoletto," or if you think you don't like or understand opera, i urge you to find this one on videotape and buy it or rent it. if you don't like this, if this production of "rigoletto" doesn't make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera, well, just give it up and move on to something else. but i suspect, if you're new to opera as i was, that you'll be pleasantly surprised.bill anderson

pavarotti and the entire cast are superb in this beautifully filmed opera by giuseppe verdi, the world's finest composer of operas. the coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with her perfect pitch. the title role is well-enacted and well-sung. the entire production is as perfect as one could expect.a masterpiece of cinematography!

the cast for this production of rigoletto is excellent. edita gruberova sings gilda magnificently and passionately. luciano pavarotti also sings splendidly. vergara is a fine maddalena; fedora barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid, giovanna. weikl sings marullo; wixell sings both rigoletto and monterone. as rigoletto, wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard-to-beat ensemble of great singers. kathleen kuhlmann in the contessa. all principals are well-known and world-renowned.this is an exciting rigoletto visually as well as musically.i have it on both laser disc and dvd. you should have it too!

this is the episode that probably most closely relates to it's partner law, "thou shalt not kill," in that it directly brings up the ever controversial issue, "why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong?" this issue is presented in two parts within the episode: before the killing, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic up-and-coming lawyer and the street thug so caught up in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what he's supposed to do, followed by the period after the trial and before the execution, when both are made to suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and thus share.one of the great things about the way these episodes work are in the both small and big ways the story is fully developed, so that we understand both the motivations and histories of characters we're only able to spend slightly less than an hour with. for all his criminal intentions and mockery, the killer is still very sympathetic, revolving the most important part of his actions around a history of accidental death. his way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy. similarly, the lawyer's idealistic naivety shows one unwilling to allow death to happen in a world where he can't control it. their meeting is, indeed, important; they both have to give in to it while not propagating it.as an aside, it's interesting how much this episode affects viewing of rouge, kieslowski's later completion of the trois colours trilogy. one of kieslowski's biggest influences seems to be the idea of justice, and considering that the decalogue is a meditation on something that represents divine justice, this one seems almost the most self-conscious.--polarisdib

having seen the full length film kieslowski made out of this episode of "the decalogue" years ago, came back to this viewer as we watched the complete ten vignettes. as with the other films, this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or, "thou shalt not kill".kryzsztof kieslowski, writing with kryzsztof piesewicz, took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime in murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations. this installment has a dostoyevskian character that kept reminding us about "crime and punishment", or at least some of the qualities of the novel are passed to the aimless youth who apparently has no redeeming qualities.the story shows the young man as he roams the streets of the city without a clear idea of what to do, or where to go. the only tender moment he displays is when he visits the photographer's place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored. kieslowski leaves it up to fate to have the murderer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver, but it's his anger and frustration that get the best of this youth to kill a man that didn't deserve to die. the last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film, past, or present.the other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man. the lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong. all he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother.kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes for a surprising film that will stay in the viewer's mind long after this episode is forgotten.

three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. the one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. i have seen other segments of the "dekalog" but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure.the film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of dekalog 5). we are made to imagine that this must have been the case. a cab driver who is a misanthrope, has two facets to his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog, cleans his cab meticulously, picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense, and remembers his wife while dying; the bad side frightens small poodles, refuses to give a ride to a drunk--probably worried that he will puke in the cab--and ogles at pretty girls. the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy, drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic, and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation, is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh. kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters.yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing. the fifth commandment "thou shalt not kill" is explored theologically--("even god spared cain...'), sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs, and psychologically (after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister, whose photograph he carries with him). what makes ordinary persons turn into killers--this is never fully explained but suggestions are legion.in kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense (note the resemblance of clown to the killer, as it hangs from the mirror in the cab). kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the commandment literally and figuratively--why do we kill? are the people legally killed truly bad? is there a force beyond society (the drunken night that led to life of a girl) that makes us into abhorrent murderers?it would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film--both without mercy. the film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by god not to kill.i understand a longer full-length version of the film was made by kieslowski. but even this short 1-hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script, intelligent editing, interesting cinematography and top-notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts.this segment anticipates the more wholesome dekalogs 6,7 and 8.

well, i fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me, but i literally just watched it- during a pbs membership drive- and frankly i'm too excited not to say anything. to really appreciate the enigma that is barbra streisand, you have to look back before the movies. before the broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. when television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today: musical variety. some musical shows were weekly series, but others were single, one-time specials, usually showcasing the special talent of the individual performer. this is where we get the raw, uninhibited first looks at streisand. she had already been a guest performer on other variety shows including garry moore, ed sullivan, and scored a major coup in a one-time only tandem appearance with the woman who would pass her the baton of belter extraordinary: judy garland. in 1966, color me barbra introduced barbra streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of her first special a year earlier almost to the letter. in 3 distinct acts, we get an abstract streisand (in an after-hours art museum looking at and sometimes becoming the works of art), a comic streisand working an already adoring audience in a studio circus (populated with many fuzzy and furry animals), and best of all, a singing streisand in mini-concert format just-- well, frankly, just doing it. it amazes me that she still had the film debut of funny girl yet to come, as well as turns as songwriter, director, and political activist. here, she is barely 24 years old, doing extraordinary things because, as she puts it in her own on-camera introduction, 'we didn't know we couldn't, so we did.' the art museum sequence is shot in philadelphia over one weekend immediately after the museum closed to the public on saturday evening, and apparently done with only one color camera. yet there are cuts, dissolves, and tracking shots galore, resulting in one rather spectacular peak moment-- the modern, slightly beatnik-flavored, "gotta move." after getting lost amongst the modern abstracts, jazz-club bongos begin, with streisand emerging in a psychedelic gown and glittering eye makeup, doing the catchy staccato tune with almost androgynous sex appeal. it is not until act 3, believe it or not, that the moment is matched or bettered by another feat: in the concert sequence, in a white gown and pearl earrings, streisand recites the torchy "any place i hang my hat is home," tearing into the final notes and revealing one of those climactic belts that makes you scream like a little girl even if you're 44 years old...and a guy. just plain old great television. check it out.

a year after her triumphant first special, "my name is barbra", barbra streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this follow-up cbs-tv special in then-revolutionary color. first broadcast in march 1966, "color me barbra" follows a similar format to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. the first takes place in the after-hours halls of the philadelphia museum of art where dressed as a period maid, she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song. in various guises, streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the "minute waltz" to the melodrama of "non c'est rien" in a modigliani painting to the beatnik-style frenzy of "gotta move" set to abstract art. my favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of queen nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of rogers and hart's "where or when".opening with another comic monologue full of silly non-sequiturs, this time in french, the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly-colored circus medley where she interacts with animals, including her beloved poodle sadie. she finds an appropriate context for "sam, you made the pants too long" with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteater's with "we have so much in common". as with the first special, the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts, "any place i hang my hat is home", "where am i going?" and "starting here, starting now" among them. also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in all-white, when the special was first released on vhs. the juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special, and a 23-year old streisand is in peak form.

follow-up to 1965's "my name is barbra", and shot in brilliant color, "color me barbra" has la streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. she's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. with her egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not ("one kiss", "yesterdays"). the circus sequence isn't as intriguing as the museum trip (with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings, an idea which works better than you may think). the circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word "face"!) is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting. still, this is a lively, jazzy special--not quite as emotionally tantalizing as "my name is barbra", but certainly a sterling sophomore effort.

after the across-the-board success of my name is barbra, cbs television permitted barbra to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. streisand wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of my name is barbra, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. even more impressively, streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of my name is barbra.once again, the special is divided into three distinct acts. filming on location at bergdorf goodman's department store was so successful in the first special, that streisand and company decided to film on location once again for the first act of this second special. the decided-upon location this time was the philadelphia art museum, which would allow endless chances for barbra to "enter" different art works that would correspond with the songs being performed. in addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color.after the recording of "draw me a circle" that is set against the opening credits, barbra then dashes around the museum in a maid costume to the strains of kern and harbach's "yesterdays." she stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. streisand performs a bittersweet rendition of hammerstein and romberg's "one kiss" as thomas eakin's concert singer, delivers a hilariously campy performance of chopin's "minute waltz" as marie antoinette, embraces abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of peter matz's "gotta move," and performs a wrenching rendition of "non c'est rien" as a distraught modigliani girl. the high point of act i, however, is when streisand compares profiles with the bust sculpture of egyptian queen nefertiti, while singing a tour de force rendition of rogers and hart's "where or when." the act ii circus medley allows streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals, while singing various songs with farm/circus/animal themes. some highlights include barbra singing "were thine that special face" to a baby elephant, performing "i've grown accustomed to that face" as a serenade to a piglet, the campy "sam, you made the pants to long" sung to a group of baby penguins, and barbra comparing profiles with an anteater while crooning "we have so much in common." streisand also swings on a trapeze and leaps from a trampoline to the chorus of "spring again," and then slows things down by performing a haunting version of "i stayed too long at the fair" while seated alone on stage. barbra also gets the chance to show off her pet poodle sadie in this segment, and even speak a little french.the act iii concert is once again the high point of the hour. dressed in a slenderizing white wool dress, the concert segment is performed on a uniquely-designed stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. streisand opens the act with a sultry rendition of harold arlen's "anyplace i hang my hat is home," before launching into heartfelt versions of the familiar standard "it had to be you" and the rarely-heard "c'est si bon (it's so good)." streisand then really amazes the audience with a breathtakingly powerful, octave-soaring performance of the sweet charity ballad "where am i going," of which streisand delivers the definitive rendition of. streisand also introduces the then-newly written richard maltby, jr.-david shire ballad "starting here, starting now," which contains an impassioned vocal from streisand that ranks among the very best vocal performances of her long career.more than anything else, color me barbra was a showcase for streisand's ever-increasing, mega-watt star power. despite the presence of even more visual razzle-dazzle, streisand herself is always the main attraction. her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first to showcase how strikingly she photographs in color. as with my name is barbra, color me barbra was another rating-smash and spawned yet another top-five, gold-selling soundtrack album. simply put, color me barbra defies tradition and emerges as a sequel that is nearly on par with a classic original.

what kind i say about this movie. well for starters, i thought that this film was okay, not the greatest not worst. i said this cause i thought that the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. now i wouldn't say that it's the greatest film that i've seeing cause of the acting. the actors that played each role, seems that they played them without emotions, as if they took the life out of them. when the wife laughed or cried, this didn't look real to me for some reason, that's just an example, but sincerely all the characters didn't act real at all. i wish i could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it at least once but how can i do that since i know that i'm not going to see this movie again. i rented this film from the library of my school, without hearing anything about the film itself or the director. i took a chance because the story that was describe on the back sounded really interesting and it really was.

i'd be hard pressed to say what is it that makes this film so important to me. while a very good movie, this is definitely not the most outstanding fassbinder's film. still along with the american soldier it keeps making it into my personal list of favorites whenever i get to thinking about it.

like margot in "fear of fear" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like fox in "fox and his friends" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like xaverl bolwieser in "the stationsmaster's wife" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like hermann hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also hans epp is a victim of the german "wirtschaftswunder"-society after world war ii in r.w. fassbinder's "the merchant of the four seasons". simply from the fact that fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero- and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favorize any sex.in hans epp's case there are the women who drive him into despair, illness and finally death. when he comes back from the foreign legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed. then hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. after having lost his job, he works as a fruit-merchant with little income, going from backyard to backyard "crying out" his produce. his mother, one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a "street-worker" in their family. "the love of his life" (she has no name in the movie) refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin. so he marries irmgard whom he does not love and who does not love him. from her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking. one evening, after his wife was stalking him, he explodes and hits her. she flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for. when irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce, hans suffers a heart attack. imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on, he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol. so he starts to feel more and more superfluous, gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive. when he finds out that irmgard cheats him, he chooses to end his life, but not like hermann hermann by having a trip into the light of madness, but he drinks himself to death in front of imrgard, their little daughter and his boozing buddies. fassbinder said in an interview that hans knew what he was doing. the question, however is: did hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment, or did he make self-justice?

the merchant of four seasons isn't what i would call a happy movie, at all, or even one that impressed me to the point of praising it to the sky (there are other fassbinder flicks for that, like veronika voss and the underrated satan's brew). but it's certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and me and others we know might possibly know, or not really want to know. i imagine in the early 70s in germany a generation, coming out of ww2, had a stigma to live with but tried their best just to get by. this is a stigma that floats all over this film, and in many instances in fassbinder's work in general, but especially because with four seasons he takes his eye on the middle class, and a particular married couple- the distanced, depressed, angry hans the fruit seller and his long-suffered wife- that is nothing short than trying for realism in the guise of melodrama. if cassavetes were a crazy german he might make this film, maybe even as just a lark.the story sounds simple enough, where hans' drinking gets out of control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the toughest to take, maybe in just any movie, the way fassbinder's camera lingers without a cut as his wife is left helpless and their daughter trying to stop him in his frenzy) and then she's ready to leave him. as he stands in the room, her family holding him back, she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there. he recovers, his business suddenly starts booming again with some help from some good (or not so good) employees - and yet this only continues his longing, for another woman, and his despair in general.and yet it's in this simplicity that fassbinder tries, and succeeds for the most part, in attaining a mood of dread, of a tense vibe in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed out. the weakest part of this all may be the acting... at least that was my initial impression. hans, played by hirschmuller, can be a stilted presence, with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes, and for a while it doesn't look like he's much of a good actor. the actress playing his wife, irm hermann, and her sister (fassbinder hanna schygulla) fare better, but only cause they're given more to do conventionally, like cry or look concerned. it takes some time to adjust to what is, essentially, a void in his guy hans, of something from his own psychological self-torment or self-pity that pervades himself and those around him who just want to get on with some sense of normalcy, especially once hans gets successful.not everything clicks together in the merchant of four seasons, but enough did to make me recommend it to those looking for a different slice-of-life than you might be used to with more modern american movies. fassbinder's world here is a combat between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the harsh, crushing sense of humanism that he feels personally and puts into characters that, for better or worse, we somehow identify with. are the epps a family you know of? or could you even be them? who's to say. it's a methodical study of tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and its goals are all attained.

the merchant of four seasons was rainer werner fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. in a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and a creative producer, actor, and director. although this movie might not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. the storyline is fairly straightforward. a man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral. the merchant of four seasons is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail, and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture. many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to hans's desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life. much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama. several times during the film, i froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition. i streamed this film, and the print was nearly flawless and second to none. fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement "anti-natural' style. he does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner, and this creates a rather stilted effect. however, by doing so, he injects an almost 'hyper-reality' to the narrative. rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama, the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner. fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and tribulations. you are constantly on the outside, looking in. this will be a disconcerting experience for many, but i found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.

in fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them. he was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat.the merchant of four seasons is one of fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a fassbinder movie? who'd have thought).his camera work was getting there too, but it was still fairly minimalist. the occasional zooms seem a bit uncomfortable at times and unnatural, but then again, fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant garde phase. this might be because michael ballhaus isn't behind the camera, but instead the slightly inferior dietrich lohmann.still, this is fassbinder, and you get your fix here. broken dreams shown so vividly and unflinchingly as to alienate audience and drive them into a depressed stupor. just what the doctor ordered. an early classic that shows remarkable progression when compared to his first films released only 2 years prior.

ostensibly, hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife, and a lover's rejection. and despite the complex portrayal--hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims--the above must be a substantial part of fassbinder's thinking as well (his use of freud and marx). but the viewer may look no further than hans' gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit.first, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the foreign legion. it was far more likely, and is in part indicated, that it was a quest for adventure, male camaraderie (escape from the female world of mother and sister) and male identity itself-- which both the legion and war offered.second, hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism. by falling for a prostitute's wiles at work, he not only rubber stamps prostitution as an oppressive institution, but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional arena--and is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career.third, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep-like male buddies, making no distinction at all between her absence or--when she shows up looking for him--presence. in fact, he is more brutal in her presence.a few hours later, in a violent and drunken state, he beats his wife in front of their daughter, who intervenes on her mother's behalf. the terror he instills in her and his daughter are palpable. but both he--and the audience--move on with nary a whimper of conscience or protest. why? because his wife is cruelly characterized as both nagging and sexually promiscuous (yes, this this may be fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to women--owned, insecure, and a commodity--but this hardly absolves hans' brutality nor fassbinder's exploitation of her in the battery scene).and then there is this male role pressure, which hans could choose to reject and protest, but instead accepts. he's too short for a male and too un-heroic to achieve the worldly success the male role recommends. but how can these be causes of despair when he not only gains his lost love as a mistress but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself., finally, hans allows harry, his war comrade, to remain, over his wife's convincing plea to the contrary, on in their house. by this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to harry than to his wife, but that male bonding supersedes his love of women. and supersedes, in the end, his own life, because it is harry's superior competence and spirit around the house that causes hans' star to fall. hans, the merchant, may be to a degree, the victim of capitalism, but more to the point, he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own male identity. his inability to let it go, is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despair.this is something that is lost, i think, not only on fassbinder, but also on han's sister, anna--although, only to a degree lost. for anna's (and fassbinder's) support of her brother--over her mother, only goes so far. she is quite insistent that only he can save himself--that her support and love cannot it itself end his self-loathing. unfortunately, she does not offer any of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more embittered than hans but, who in the end, is able to pick up the pieces, and save herself and daughter, and present a marked contrast to han's fall.

the merchant of four seasons is a film about a lack of love. the film starts off with the main character; hans epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. he returns to his mother, not to be told how much she loves him, or how much she's missed him; but to be told that he is worthless and, even worse, that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead. it is the character's relation to women that makes this film so hateful; the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender; he is consistently humiliated by them, and it is through his relations with them that his life isn't as great as it could have been. this is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink. he lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman, and even his wife; a woman that is supposed to love him, never really shows any affection for him. even at the end, his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband.the merchant of four seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film. there isn't a scene in the movie where someone is happy, and not only that; but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of it's central characters. the movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time, that's for sure. despite all the misery, the film never steps out the bounds of reality; every event in this movie can - and most probably has - happened, and that only serves in making the movie more shocking. the film is, of course, helmed by rainer werner fassbinder; the cult german director that committed suicide in 1982. this is only my second taste of the man's work, but through just two films, it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates. both films are downtrodden and gritty - yet realistic pieces of art. his characterization in this movie is subtle; we only ever get to know the characters through their plight's and not through their character. this is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film, not the people themselves - and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like, it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to. the merchant of four seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable; the movie is high on substance and low on style, and that makes for a very memorable picture, and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience. it is with that in my mind that i give this film my highest recommendations; it's not sweet and it's not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression, and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you.

i remember seeing this movie back when it was released and i still remember the 'buzz' i felt when i left the cinema. everything about this movie is magnificent! the music is top notch and i still play the soundtrack after all these years.i have seen this movie so many times and yet i still get yearnings to watch it again and again. nicholas cage was great and whenever i see cameron dye in anything nowadays, i always associate him with this movie. it is too bad the rest of the cast didn't go on to greater things but maybe that is part of this film's charm.i won't do a film school critique as i am sure all the analysts out there can find fault if they wanted to, but what i will say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life over 20 years later. the movie 'feels' great and stirs up emotions when you watch it (well...it did for me) and i cannot recommend it highly enough for anybody who has not yet seen it.you either 'get' the movie or you don't! those of you who 'get it' will be rewarded with a unique movie experience.

happy 25th birthday to valley girl! great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. a wonderful rendition of high school life and "gritty downtown" from a suburban perspective.the soundtrack contains songs by modern english, felony, josie cotton, sparks, payola$, josie cotton, the plimsouls, the psychedelic furs, men at work, the flirts and bananarama.this movie truly is romeo and juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's los angeles. julie's dad, played by frederic forrest (sonny bono, anyone?) is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he sprung such a materialistic offspring. yet, he doesn't judge, ya dig??

"the dresser" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. the film is brimming with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the "energetic" character of norman (tom courtenay). although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (albert finney) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in "bullitt" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious. in the end, "the dresser" will bore many people silly, but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema.7.7 out of 10

bonny hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut. minnie driver and david duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film. carroll o'conner does a great job as grace's grandfather. other great character actors play his card buddies. jim belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of megan, part of the extended family.faith, family, and marriage are respected. a few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. and in the background that wonderful dean martin tune--"return to me."recommended.

this movie is very well done although the ending is given away too early in the film. the four elderly men in the restaurant are what makes this film fun to watch. minnie driver is a very talented actress and comes across wonderfully on screen.

this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema. by seeing this film,we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy,such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage,and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. cinema was then not only one form of arts. it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. it is said, that even picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! audience that time was also different. i read that after seeing kurosawa's "ikiru(live)" in its first release, young couple quietly told each other,"it is a good film, isn't it?". i think,contemporary cinema, though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective, has lost the most important---reliance of audience.cienma was once really the most popular art from and, unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music,gave millions of people hope and ideals. in this point of view,"letyat zhuravli" must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time, as "city light","ikiru" and "la strada".

this movie is sweet - not cloying, just warm-spirited and kind. i found it only mildly funny, and the premise *is* wildly improbable, but the characters are so charming (especially minnie driver's) that they had my full attention right from the beginning, and soon had my affection too.bonnie hunt has done a great job in her directing debut, and a good job with the writing as well. i highly recommend this movie and will see it again, i'm sure.

i watched this movie on tcm last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in toronto. i told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her boris. in a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road. then i remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him. but we do continue to follow veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting stanislavskian behavior. how, one wonders, did kalatozov and his cameraman urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence. but what did i see in this version? after crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence. seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited. what a downer!

if you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see "letyat zhuravli" (called "the cranes are flying" in english). it tells the story of veronika (tatiana samoylova) and boris (aleksey batalov), who are in love on the verge of wwii. they are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes fly by, when the war starts. boris is promptly sent off to war. veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son, whom she does not love. boris, meanwhile, continues trotting through the countryside, fighting the nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war, until he he runs out of energy. when veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it, until boris' body arrives home on one of the trains. simultaneously, the radio announces that germany has surrendered and the allied powers have won the war; the soviet union lost 27 million citizens, but it's the start of a new era.this movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield, but also how it affected the civilian population. this is definitely a movie that everyone should see.

this is a magnificent, and in many ways impressive film. i saw it on tv as a little boy, with my throat almost strangled with tears, and again today on the magnificently restored criterion dvd.cranes is the very essence of the war weepie. imagine umbrellas of cherbourg with no music and no color, or waterloo bridge with no class consciousness.tatiana samoilova, a cross between vivien leigh and bjork, is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fianc√© enlists and doesn't write or come back.the fianc√©, boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic. very daring too, because so close to "over the top." but that scene will stay with you.although the soviets were so defined by wwii, the movie is quite unspecific, and more powerful for it. the pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. there is no attempt at period detail. the whole film becomes more and more stylized, until the siberian scenes, which feel like a modern opera set (that is a compliment). the cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - there again, comparable to cherbourg. the production feels like a big budget (those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek).go for it. don't expect a bitter socialist pill (although it is, of course, very sad). the cranes are flying is an impressive slice of world cinema, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.

i'm out of words to describe the beauty of "the cranes are flying", but i'll try anyway to write about it. it's a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the second world war. it's the classic story of lovers (boris & veronika) separated by the war and of what comes between them. the film's images are so gorgeous, that you'll be carried away - the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion.there are few scenes that portray directly the war: a bombing - wind, lightnings, explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist, veronika, who waits for the return of boris; and there's another scene on the front, where we we will be confronted by a emotional/visual hurricane showing the images played in boris' mind. another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky. this image stands as a the symbol for nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: not to give up hope and fight for a better future.kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply. it is not just pure technique. tatyana samojlova is perfect as veronika. what more can i say? the film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the second world war. but it could have happened anytime, anywhere. as long there are wars (great or small) the film and its message will remain relevant.

or if you've seen the "evil dead" trilogy and/or "bubba ho-tep", then you should know that his movies are total farces. with "man with the screaming brain", he goes all out again. in this case, he plays smarmy american businessman william cole visiting bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country? - when a woman kills him. so, strange scientist ivan ivanov (stacy keach) replaces half of cole's brain with the brain of a former kgb agent, leaving him acting sort of like steve martin in "all of me".yes, the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. much of the real humor comes from "evil dead" director sam raimi's brother ted as ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant pavel. the two men have a relationship more like laurel and hardy or gilligan and the skipper.so just understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you won't be a bit disappointed. i liked it, anyway.

an awesome made for the sci-fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they've churned out. bruce campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor,stacey keach,and his half-wit assistance,ted raimi. the film is pure b movie gold and its great to see keach and ram up on screen with bruce, and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on bruce's comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious, and makes me ask the question, why isn't this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned?, it indeed a sick world. definitely worth a watch.

man with the screaming brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but i'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where yegor and william battle for control of william's body, is straight out of evil dead ii). there are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, "what are you looking at?!" the movie looks like a sci-fi channel original, probably because it was. the acting is actually pretty good. i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. ted raimi handled the standard "bumbling assistant" role admirably enough, and bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending american jerk. (now that he's writing his own films, you'd think he'd give himself a role that he hasn't been typecast in already.) man with the screaming brain is a bizarre, nonsensical b-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.

sick of the current cinema output, particularly american cinema, i've been making an effort to see the oscar-winning foreign films. that's when i came across this gem. slow to start, it picks up nicely once war is declared. basically an old fashioned girl-waits-for-boy-to-return-from-war-story, the performances, the cinematography make this so very much more. why tatyana samojlova as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me(though she has remained successful in her own country). you take the journey with her: young, defiant impetuous young girl, who, through the ravages of war becomes a very sober, somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating). we love her as much as the camera does. and the camera-work! was this the pioneer in hand-held camera work? it truly adds an immediacy to the story. and the beauty of it (like when tatyana's character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence). i am humbled and grateful to see this film.

(some spoilers) it took some 19 years for bruce campbell to finally put his masterpiece " man with the screaming brain" on the screen. but campbell had to alter his story by having it, due to financial problems, take place in sofia bulgaria not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in los angeles california.in the film burce campbell plays us pharmaceutical tycoon willian cole who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife jackie, antoinette byron,to the former communist republic of bulgaria. it's there that william wants to help finance bulgaria's almost non-existent mass transportation system.it's poor william's misfortune to get involved with both gypsy woman tatoya, tamara gorski, and her ex-boyfriend yegor, valdimir kolev, an ex-kgb taxi driver. the two, william & yegor, will unwittingly end up shearing their brains, inside william's skull,because of tatoya's jealousy and vindictiveness.after tatoya murders both william and yegor their bodies are delivered to mad scientist dr. ivan ivanowitch ivanov, stacy keach, by his loyal assistant pavel, ted raimi, to have their brains experimented with. dr. ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better then one. and now with the material, william & yegor, available to him dr. ivanov at last is finally going to prove it. what dr. ivanov is going to sadly find out is that by fusing the two heads, or brains, together their brain waves will overlap and cause them to not only malfunction but turn against each other!william with yegor's right lobe fused into his damaged brain is out to find tatoya and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and yegor. yegor for his part is stuck in william's head who's likes and dislikes, in both food and drink, are totally opposite to his own. this causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of william's body!things get even more screwed up when jackie finding out that tatoya murdered her husband william confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of bravoda call gypsy town and ends up being murdered herself. brought back to dr. ivanov by his assistant pavel it's determined, with no body available,to plant jackie's brain inside of an experimental robot that pavel's been working on. the operation is a rousing success but the only drawback is that jackie, with her brain inside the robot, has to have her brain recharged every few hours! or, like a real brain lacking oxygen, she'll die together with the robot's batteries.combination 1930's-like screw-ball comedy and horror flick with both william & yegor turning the bulgarian town of bravoda upside down in trying to find tatoya and make her pay, with her life, for the sad state of existence she put them both into. ***spoiler alert*** it's dr. ivanov who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting, and thus cooperating, with each other! this is done by him instead of fusing the brains together dr. ivanov keep them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall in between the two uncooperative globs of gray matter.

normally, i do not review online, but it's saturday and i'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and xena: warrior princess (i can't get the damned 'joxer the mighty' song out of my head, it's been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). if you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look like? if you expect more out of bruce campbell than what he puts out (in the most literal sense) than why in g-d's holy name do you watch his movies? no one watches a bruce campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible, we watch them so we feel better about ourselves (like those people who watch jerry springer and eat chunky monkey), and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho-babble. i, personally, love bruce campbell movies. i'm not a complete idiot, in fact, i see myself as an intellectual and a scholar(haha, shut up, ally). his movies reflect insane, random, quirky, ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain, screaming or no, can enjoy. that, and he was kind of sexy on xena: warrior princess, even with the facial hair. i rate this movie an excellent 10, just because i can. if you can't take simplistic plot-schemes (if any), hot babes in sci-fi splendor(leather, spandex), and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity, then fer cryin' out loud, don't watch the movie(or any that so much as mention the name bruce campbell). oh yeah, ted raimi was awesome in this movie! way to go ted! you did the best with what you had. ;|

i haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since star wars episode iii. both shows sold out, and for good reason. the man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (hey, i'm a dork too.) bruce campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! the movie was cheesy in the best possible way. it may be the funniest movie that bruce has done. ted raimi steals the show with his bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot! who knew that ted could rap? i changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. there is nothing funnier than a robot...doing the robot.as for bruce's performance: "i take the 5th." thanks bruce. thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all of the fun.

i saw this last week during bruce campbell's book tour. i thought it was amazing. almost everything i would expect from a bruce campbell sci-fi movie. its campy and very funny. ted raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. the plot is wacky, an american business man goes to bulgaria and is killed. stacy keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings bruce campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-kgb turned cabbie. bruce campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the kgb agent. the movie has all the great bruce campbell slap stick and humor. the movie is somewhat predictable, i knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. however i didn't go to see this movie because i thought it would have an oscar winning script, i went to see it because it was a bruce campbell sci-fi movie and i was not disappointed in the least. i highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. although before the movie he said the sci-fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it tv friendly. if you are a fan of bruce, i highly recommend it.

this was a funny movie. just having seeing the evil dead trilogy not a week ago (and left wanting for more), i got as many bruce campbell movies as i could, including really bad ones. this one is funny, without being exceptional, but as sure as hell original.i mean you've got mad scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half brain freaks, gypsies, ex kgb cab drivers, jealousy, murders of passion, love, romance, sex, action and what more, all with the same 6 actors :)you really have to see it and enjoy it, i can't explain it in a text box. i guess it is not so much a cult movie as evil dead was, but it certainly has that bruce campbell touch i love. ted raimi lends a hand, tamara gorski looks both beautiful and interesting (she has gone a long way from the hooker in friday the 13th) and vladimir kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor, although he will probably be cast as secondary character in hollywood movies his entire career.bottom line: funny movie. if you liked evil dead you'll like this, too.

ah, classic comedy. at the point in the movie where brains get messed together, a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially, reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie.for years and years, bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him. we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep. we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies, and we want to see 'man with the screaming brain'. with the title alone, one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie, like army of darkness, only with more silly and less monsters.the idea of the movie is simple. bruce sees doctor. doctor has new idea. bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor. coincidentally, it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him. hilarity ensues.with the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy, and journeyman stacy keach as dr. ivan ivanovich ivanov, it's funny, that does this movie. complete funny. never a point of scary.if you like the silly bruce campbell, you'll like this. then again, why would you be watching this if you didn't like bruce campbell?

this is screamingly funny (well, except when bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a little sad). ted raimi and stacy keach are both excellent and worth watching.sure, it's not a big budget-suit controlled blockbuster, but it's everything it promises to be and more- and btw- the women are wonderful in their parts, though i don't know them from other movies, i'd welcome seeing them again.the two-brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for bruce's outstanding physical comedy- he is one yummy guy!thanks bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!

okay, so i love silly movies. if you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of mr. bruce campbell, i would go see this movie. this movie is all that i wanted it to be. being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. every time i thought to myself "this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen...." then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. it's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie. if you are a fan of campbell i'd say 'see it', bring your friends, laugh at it. it's fun. it's not classic, or anything, but if it's on tv some night, watch it. it has become, for me, a movie i would file under "indulgent movies". movies that may not be good, but after a hard day of work, i could come home and watch, (this list also includes 'harold and kumar go to white castle', 'army of darkness', and ' intolerable cruelty' ) if you feel like a over the top, wonderfully slightly bad movie, watch this. if not, go rent "bubba ho-tep"

i saw it last night and i was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. the whole audience was. bruce campbell has made a damn funny movie! i don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. just one funny scene after another. my hats of to mr. campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. bruce was there to introduce the film and do a q and a, which was a treat. a lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame, but bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic. he was great! anyway, loved the film. i'll be looking forward to seeing this on dvd later this year. b sure to check it out on the sci-fi channel this fall. i highly recommend this one.

these are the kinds of movies i loved, and still love growing up. unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. this movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy.there was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't a list material. but that is not the point. the point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge cgi clich√©' filled movies. there are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you, and not get as much money as they can.besides, its also nice to know that good ol' bruce isn't dead yet.

this is a fantastic film. the acting is some of the best i've seen. tatyana samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting. the the cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. watching it, i could see parallels of cinematography used today. this is truly a groundbreaking film. because of the cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes. it's a very touching and powerful piece. my friend told me it was must see, and i definitely agree with her. this is one of those films that you watch and never forget. everyone should see this intensely moving film. this should be put on everyone's "movies to see before ________ (whatever)" list.

shot entirely on location in bulgaria, the man with the screaming brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly-american types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy. william cole and his wife jackie arrive in bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler yegor. things start to go awry when tatoya, the maid, murders yegor and william and a mad scientist implants a piece of yegor's brain in william's head. robots eventually become involved, as do gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, bruce campbell riding a pink vespa with prissy little streamers, and all-of-me-style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body.the man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny film. it has the most hilarious tracking shot i have ever seen (when bruce campbell's character, fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a falling-down-the-steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing. the whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and i would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, bruce campbell, or b-movies in general.

i went to see this movie at a book signing in lexington, ky last night. after a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with mr. bruce campbell (you have to say it all, not just bruce or mr. campbell ;d), friends while the books were being signed, and a qna session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.so as not to spoil anything, i wont go into detail...but i loved the movie! mr. bruce campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel. the characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (what movies do *you* know of that are based in bulgaria?) and the setting was both near-original and fun! on top of that the humor that is portioned throughout the movie that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie.while this movie dosen't have as great of a general appeal to people as some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of (as mr. bruce campbell put it) 'b-movies' that are listed as 'a-movies' (bewitched, dukes of hazard, charlie and the chocolate factory? come on guys!).

i don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. it was great. classic bruce campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a bruce movie for you watch it for bruce. also ted rami was excellent. i found this movie hilarious and entertaining i still crack up when i recall bruce on that pink moped. now i will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like b movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear. but if you like slap stick and off the wall sci-fi plots this movie is for you.hail the king baby!

i was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. i must say, i was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. i was completely mistaken. this movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it i simply loved. bruce campbell was as amazing as ever. the biggest surprise was none other than ted raimi, you know, sam's little brother. he played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine. but i really cannot ignore the magic that is bruce campbell. though i did think that ted raimi stole the show, bruce did what he does best on the big screen. somewhere between the sketchy nasty american business man and the tragic victim, he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences. the movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. the crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took.this movie may not be oscar material, but my goodness, it was amazing. i would highly recommend this to any bruce campbell fan. also, anybody that likes campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch this. can't wait till this makes it out to dvd.take it as you want to....- the fed

i find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic, and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. but i admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. i find the inauspiciously performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever film school laws d' urville martin broke funny. speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. this film looks like fun. when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore. they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen, scorsese, lucas, capra? i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first.

if you watch this movie you'll be quoting it and referring to it for a long time to come. it's been years since i saw dolemite and i still quote it to this day. it's a true classic. it is so mind-numbingly awful that it makes a hilarious view. every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing. every wobbly shot a work of art(?). and every punch and kick so woefully executed. you won't believe your eyes. it's all i can say. if i really get into how mesmerizing this movie is i won't be able to stop and i'll go way over the imdb 1000-word limit.please, please watch this movie. you'll be in hysterics. either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.

this movie is funny in more ways than one. it's got action. it's got humour. it's got attitude. it's got dolemite's all girl army of kung-fu hos! and that's just what the movie offers as a film. it's also badly acted by some, the mic makes more than one cameo appearance, and some "punches" miss by feet. but when you make a movie this cool, who's got time to pay attention to those "details"? this movie rocks. rent it tonight, if you can find it... i had to buy it to see it, but i don't regret it!

the best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. rudy ray moore is my personal hero. whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, i can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. when it comes to blaxploitation, rudy's the man. nobody is meaner. watch dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down mr. big and willie green. awesome plot, huh? there are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. if you say a couple of lines from dolemite, you are instantly cool. if you are in the mood for a laugh riot, rent this movie. also check out the human tornado, disco godfather, and petey wheatstraw the devil's son-in-law. now, can you dig that? "you no business barring, insecure, rat soup-eating, motha!!'"

yes, this is one of the greats of the black action genre. confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence (at times reaching a disturbing pitch, even for a fan of the genre) this movie isn't your shaft in the park. wonderful bits of rudy ray moore comedy stand up that don't seem funny, at least not to a white boy like me, but great in context. much better than its dissimilar sequel, "the human tornado"

anybody interested what black film making was like in the 70's watch this film. some the dialog in this film is so funny ie the summary of my submission. also watch out for the boom mic to show up in some of the scenes as well as some of the best karate action ever. don't take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed, go into it with an open mind and step into the world of one the the baddest mutha in the world dolemite!!! editing wise its put together like it was sliced with a razor but once again this film is so much more than what you see in the movie it has influenced the black community in ways you cant understand!!!

this is one of my three all-time favorite movies. my only quibble is that the director, peter yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so great i forgive him.albert finney and tom courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. the script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii (and, therefore, what it was like in the 30s as well). lots of great, subtle touches, lots of broad, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly done. scene after scene just blows me away, and then there's the heartbreaking climax.

fabulous cinematography from sergei urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work. the opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look. all is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter. another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence. soviet film making of the highest order.

the various law & order and csi franchises had better be glad dolomite doesn't pass through. the lady cops,adas,and coroners would all be enthralled and the males be subject to such soul shivering,badge melting warp speed kicks ( wouldn't you just love to see david caruso's horatio and that know it all on csi get dolomite's hush puppies pulled from their respective asses)ice t might start crying and get back on the playa trail.low low budget,bad but enthusiastic acting,and a vision at what gutbucket nightclubs offered to its patrons;funk bands soul singers,the last vestiges of old style chitlin circuit entertainers( that weirdling dance troupe)james brown,wilson pickett,otis redding,and a host of others came from those clubs to glory, while their peers labored on in local or regional stardom. rudy ray moore came from that background and the character of dolomite is a mix of the bold black badasses who strutted through. he shouldn't have went to the joint, the swine didn't have a warrant, how his middle aged ,blubbery self maintained a loyal stable of kung fu wenches is a mystery only a student of cults can explain, but all that is beside the point. it's a glorious home movie of a legendary performer that compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from established hollywood to indie film snorefests,hits its mark. a fun dumb movie!

this movie is all about blaxploitation, there is absolutely no plot at all. a pimp stops some bad guys with his kung fu hoes to try to get his nightclub back. rated r for strong language, and a brief sexual situation.

dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. it is a pivotal film in the black exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. it wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting "whitey" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's. it was a guilty pleasure, great fun and best to watch it with friends. (10 out of 10)

dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who takes down the man, meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. mind you that these women know karate, and are fine foxy ladies.spoiler--the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with dolemite ripping the heart out of willy green. make sure your copy is unrated.plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the hamburger pimp, reverend, mayor, queen bee, and others. the apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style. there are a few mess-ups in the production, such as boom mikes accidentally appearing, among other things, but that adds to the charm and laughs.i would recommend drinking a 6-pack before and during this movie, and keeping squares and the man a far distance away.

citizen kane....the godfather part ii....d'urville martin's dolemite. this is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. rudy ray moore, in a role that transcends academy awards stars as dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. he clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (i myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. this is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive. the true godfather of rap (not this new ali nonsense) moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970's, and thats saying something. this one is highly recommended folks, if not for the one-liners alone.

certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film √∞ buy this immediately! where else can you get a run down of 70√µs fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the titanic√µs sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named queen bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) with a filming style that√µs a cross between a porno movie/dawn of the dead/ and car wash, you cannot go wrong. this is one to watch over and over again√©after you put the kids to bed.

director mikhail kalatozov's film the cranes are flying (letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. from the screenplay by viktor rozov, based on his own play, kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. however, this russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us, straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all, that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting, we see a new vision of wwii. we have young men volunteering to wage war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. with so much hatred towards our current situation in the middle east, and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return.communist russia shows how involved all were in the war. while boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines, his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl veronika, doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. an entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. even the factory that boris and his friend stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. whether this is all a glorified look into russia at the outset of wwii or not, i don't know. there are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country, it is all praise and thanks. some in america could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.the acting is top-notch throughout, but some deserve singling out. i really enjoyed antonina bogdanova in a small role as boris' grandmother. she is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. vasili merkuryev, as the patriarch fyodor ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance. as spoken at the end, about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears, merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. he puts on a tough exterior, especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. but when boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man, seated in sorrow at the table. he loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. aleksey batalov is effective as boris, a happy-go-lucky young man, and idealist, doing what he believes is right, and aleksandr shvorin is good as the villainous mark, staying home due to his talented piano skills, or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. that love, played by tatyana samojlova, really draws the audience in to her grief, dejection, and slim glimmer of hope. the true star of the film, she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way, needing to steer back on course, hoping that she did so soon enough for boris' return.besides the realism to the story, as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across, i also loved the visual style of the film. sergei urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. it is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background at the top, as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. there are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. sharp angles are utilized, as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.the real feats, however, are those instances of the long shot. used well towards the end to follow veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for boris, her own farewell needing to be said. the planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples kisses, people yelling to one another, and more, all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. it's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; the cranes are flying shows how successful placement and mise en sc√®ne can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders, adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.

mikhail kalatozov's the cranes are flying is a superb film. winner of the golden palm at cannes film festival, it has an excellent cinematography and performance by tatyana samojlova, the only russian actor ever to win an award in cannes for a performance. she plays veronika, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and without preoccupations, with plans of getting married. her life will get upside down when world war ii strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army. the film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight, waiting for a letter or other information. it is a portrayal of lost innocence. samojlova does a magnificent job, and her character transformation will break your heart. the camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups, it is a dancing camera. the first scene in the stairs is fantastic, but it isn't the only one, there is later a scene when veronika attempts committing suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, the bombing of veronika's house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed. simply great! 10 out of 10.

i remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of donald crowhurst in 1968, in the golden globe single handed around the world yacht race. i was a 13 year old, living in england. the previous year francis chichester (later sir francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. i remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white tv!) and then his knighting by the queen. it provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the uk. it all seems so quaint now. chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped half way, in australia, to re-fit his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping.it's important to remember that this was a world pre-gps, when communications on land were still pretty erratic, never mind in the middle of the ocean. now with gps receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth, it's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally, vanish. as donald crowhurst did. a number of yachtsmen signed up (all men back then), including mystery man, crowhurst. essentially a weekend sailor, crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise, including careers in the british army, the air force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. he wanted to do something big with his life, and he saw the five thousand pound first prize (well over $100,000 in today's money) and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business. he signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat, and which meant failure would bankrupt him, and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race. now the brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the 'pros'. (think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race.) the public queued up to see him set off, but his boat wasn't really ready, and even as he started (the last competitor to leave the uk) crowhurst must have known he didn't seriously have a chance. but too much was riding on him to quit.in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife's face. left behind with their 4 children, she is interviewed movingly throughout the film, together with one of crowhurst's sons. she was in a no-win situation. had she attempted to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but afterward she was riven with doubt, as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him. faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. laid up offshore argentina and brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic, thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe. he elaborately falsified his logs, and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan. but as one after another the other competitors dropped out, he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized. unable to face certain detection, his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. his yacht was found. he never was. this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic french sailor, who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize, when he abruptly left the race, unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder, eventually pulling up some 10 months later in tahiti. having spent some seven years working at sea myself, (albeit on very different ships to these) i well understand the pull of the ocean. standing on deck, seeing water in every direction to the horizon, knowing there's a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull, without easy access to tv or radio (even nowadays on most working ships, you feel pretty isolated), it's possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea, the search for self. i strongly suspect that robin knox johnston, the ex navy guy who won the race (and many since) probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off, which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route. those who went searching for something profound within themselves, may not have entirely liked what they found. the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this, (did it really look quite that bad? i don't remember it looking quite so dowdy, but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie. highly recommended.

like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure, the image of the cranes that are crossing a muscovite sky. they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.in the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.but man is not a bird. life draws up its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort. war breaks out, and without much hesitation boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty. he cannot even say good-bye to veronica, for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away. surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract boris' attention must inevitably fail.boris eventually gets killed in war, without veronica learning about it for the moment. his brother mark, a vigorous musician, who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption, is eager to take his place. veronica initially resists, but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms. a marriage takes place, which is never accepted by the family.soon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris' return is the one and only thing she actually longs for. she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospital.when war finally is over, once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers. again veronica is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies. in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers, until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers, for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris' death.once again the cranes invade the sky, drawing their wayward lines. but now veronica is watching them on her own, and the look in her eyes is a different one. she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans, to follow the guidelines of your dreams. for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate.

this is a gem. as a film four production - the anticipated quality was indeed delivered. shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films, well arranged and simply gripping. it's long yet horrifying to the point it's excruciating. we know something bad happened (one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews) but we are compelled to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories, as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him, wondering why they didn't stop him in time. it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very-well made documentary.

deep water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. the testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late 1960's and a ground-breaking round the world yacht race. the personal conflicts of duty to family, self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films i have seen. i was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. the story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed. most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters. this movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense, joy and drama.

this is an account of events that have been covered in print several times, and i had read two books - 'a voyage for madmen' and 'the strange last voyage of donald crowhurst' before seeing the film in sheffield just before christmas. i must say, it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 sunday times golden globe yacht race. these men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no gps, and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece. not to mention the months of solitude, the thundering southern ocean, little sleep, and boats that were often literally falling apart around them.this documentary is excellently put together in my opinion, tightly edited, well paced with superb narration. the archive footage and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life. clare crowhurst's interview footage is especially revealing and moving as she relates the events that led up to her husband, donald crowhurst's departure from teignmouth, the doubts and fears in his mind and her reaction as subsequent events unfolded.i was moved and had even shed a tear or two by the time the credits started rolling, and overheard other people expressing similar feelings.the two books i mentioned above are useful for more detail and back-story which couldn't have been fitted into the 90 minutes and i would recommend those too.this is ultimately a true story of human courage and human frailty. a must see for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human endeavour and real-life heroes.

1931 also presented "an american tragedy", the original tale of "who will he take up with, poor girl or rich girl". this was a truly entertaining film. babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. monroe owsley, unmemorably played babs's husband. i had never heard of him, but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing crosby of "the big broadcast" ('32), even a receding hairline and wingy ears. ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a true movie pioneer going wayyy back. the dilemma is resolved at the end, to the strains of the title and i believe annette hanshaw had the hit recording, although the off-screen voice did very well. i also enjoyed the dance hall scenes. i'm sure they were authentic; the band, a leading one of the time was superb. good job, lionel barrymore!!!!

one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore, "ten cents a dance" stars barbara stanwyck as the dance-hall girl "barbara" in her sixth role. stanwyck looks quite "plain-jane" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. then along comes rich guy bradley carlton (ricardo cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (cortez and stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) then she meets eddie, who's very different from the dashing carlton. the writer, jo swerling, had worked on some biggies (its a wonderful life, guys and dolls, and gone with the wind) so i was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary. the story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru, and is very similar to "the bride walks out" from 1936, also starring stanwyck.... t.b.w.o. is much more clever, but also more tame, due to on-slaught of the hays code...

this is one of barbara stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. she's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall. she really doesn't like the work, but it's a living. her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy ricardo cortez. well, after marrying, it turns out her "nice guy" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy. by the end of the film, barbara simply has had enough, as any sane woman would walk from this horrid marriage.in the 1920s and early 30s, hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. while ten cents a dance isn't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened production code was created and enforced starting in 1934. in some ways the code was great--after all, parents didn't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in ben hur, 1925). however, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no 1934 and thereafter. this is really a shame, as i don't think ten cents a dance was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (barbara stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. even so, allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldn't have been.overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. give this one a look.fyi--sadly, ricardo cortez was actually not hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was jewish. he was an excellent leading man of his time, but today is all but forgotten.

this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun, not great but entertaining.based on a song by rogers & hart that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe owsley. she and owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses cortez, who still holds out hope. she helps hubby get a job in cortez's company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (yup! i know, it's pretty funny....). finally he embezzles $5,000 from cortez, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to cortez....and i won't reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished. owsley is the weak point; he's unattractive and sniveling, while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.while ostensibly a drama, it's filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. but there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point stanwyck says to cortez, "my brains are in my feet, while yours are in...." that's pretty darn suggestive for 1931! there's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the code clamped down and whitewashed everything. an amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.

this is a forgotten classic of a film, and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for "gummo". gummo is good, river's edge is way, way better. its no secret that keanu reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. no, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. but, he was born for some roles: ted preston, esquire from bill and ted, and his role in this film. he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. then there's crispin glover. i think his performance in this film is the best of his career. he is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character. then there's dennis hopper, who is perfect as well. this movie is simply amazing, and if you haven't seen it, run out and watch it today. its brilliant. one of the best portrayals of modern america i've seen.

"river's edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw "blue velvet", you know thats saying something. viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated "kids". the previews for "kids" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. in reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. "river's edge" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better. the only times it goes from being disturbing to distasteful is the constant image of the dead nude body. outside of that, the film is thought-provoking and, for all its minor flaws, quite realistic.keanu reeves, known for being a particularly wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burned-out teenager. ione skye is equally sympathetic and likable. dennis hopper (on the comeback trail with this, "blue velvet", and "hoosiers") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover. crispin glover, while always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group. the best performance however is definitely daniel roebuck. as the murderer john, roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. its a shame he didn't become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than reeves.the film is overall fantastic and daring. don't mistake this for another lame john hughes clich√©d high school flick such as "the breakfast club". this is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. fans of this movie are advised to check out a canadian film from 1981 called "out of the blue", directed by dennis hopper. its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, may have been an influence on "river's edge". (7/10)

river's edge is more than just the story of a murder. it's an indictment of the wave of apathy that has plagued pockets of youth for decades now. our main characters are a group of what my high school would have referred to as "stoners". one of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to "talk sh*t" to him. this dangerous young man played by daniel roebuck has an intensity that will startle you. he takes the other kids in the group out to show them his girlfriend's body, and strangely enough, nobody seems really freaked out about it. the balance of the film punctuates the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how guilt is eventually able to worm its way inside even these apathetic kids.river's edge is certainly not condoning or championing the behavior of its characters. we clearly see the dangers presented by such unchecked apathy and having only the desire to get drunk or high. we are shown the dysfunctional home lives these kids have, and perhaps this is meant to explain their awful behavior. but could it only be unstable homes that lead to this type of destructive living? crispin glover is his usual whacked-out self. he drives around town in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. he tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime, but clearly he does not understand what could have made the young man do it. dennis hopper plays an older man these kids get their dope from. though he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the apathy and rage of the younger generation. witness his confused reaction as roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. as wild as hopper's character is, even he knows this young man should not be walking the face of the earth.what will you think of these kids? well, there is really no way to like their characters. some are less despicable than others, but you cannot help either hating or feeling sorry for them. twenty years later, there is still an apathy alive and well in a great many young people out there. when do these kids get lost? what makes so many of them want to act anti-social? this film, and the questions it poses about teenagers will stick with you for a while. that's a fact.8 of 10 stars.the hound.

it's not difficult, after watching this film, to see why post-silent soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem. don't get me wrong. the cranes are flying is, for the first half at least, supremely entertaining, boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh, brisk, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with, but never quite topples into, lelouch territory. it's just that , in its subsuming of vast social, national and world events to a love affair, it is essentially no different from a conventional hollywood movie.of course, in a soviet union that emphasised the state above all else, and in an era (world war two) that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism, this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief. and the thematic similarities - all consuming love rent apart by war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (seventh heaven, les parapluies de cherbourg) also adds to its potential loveability.the story is simple enough. boris, a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family, and veronika, a student, conduct a breezy relationship at night, their only free time. boris's cousin mark, a composer, also has eyes on veronika. when the nazis invade russia, boris secretly volunteers, to the chagrin of his family and lover. he promises to write to veronika, but never does, thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off, or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable. veronika's parents die during an air raid, and she moves in with boris's family, helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers.distressed by boris's silence, veronika is also assailed by the attentions of mark, who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official. she is eventually worn down, and marries him, to the disapproval of her adopted family. boris, meanwhile, is killed in action. veronika, disgusted with herself and an adulterous mark, refuses to believe this, and awaits his return, fostering a young orphan bearing his name.the title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love, symbolic perhaps of its transcendant, epiphanical power. but this is illusory - the cranes fly in a v formation, and this shape pervades the entire film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groupings of people, composition, camera angles, the heroine's name - or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another. this serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies, and also suggest the stalinist power that is never, specifically, mentioned in the film. although the pair seem to be free in space, whether literally in an unpeopled environment, or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironised, minimised, torn apart - by circumstances, families, by crowds (see the brilliant, if obvious, sequences where veronika is engulfed by tanks, or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd), or simply by the film's structure, which is constantly distancing, through paralellism, their closeness. although at the beginning, the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music.what is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces. the whole film, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike, we are never shown its harsh, brutal actuality, just its effects on the lovers. in fact, it is transformed into a majestic spectacle, devoid of nasty germans. on the home front, the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade, or ruins of almost gothic decadence. in the bunker, the threat to the soviet empire is less important than boris's perceived indifference. the empty, oneiric moscow spaces the lovers initially, than veronika with her mother, walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces. when mark tries to force himself on veronika, the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. this is a brilliant sequence, filmed with silent, expressionistic terror, in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence, all the more compelling for the earlier scenes' wistful gentleness.it's not much different at the front either, where fights over girls' honour are more urgent than tactics, nazis or despair. the movement of boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war, its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and boris' final, pre-death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream-wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety, in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque.from this point on the film becomes a little less interesting, slightly more obvious. one more grasp for expressionist overload - veronika's attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film. the use of deep focus, at first ravishing, soon becomes wearing, devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning welles brought to its use in citizen kane. after what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end, when individual suffering, as so often in russian art, transmutes into symbolic (i.e. sexless, dehumanised) hope. a pity.

i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life, and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on.

i think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting to me. it is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on the simpsons. layne is jimbo, john is kearney, and tony is dolph. there is even an episode of the simpsons where jimbo uses the line "i poked her with a stick."the jimbo-layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. kearney has the shaved head, unlike john, but is the big, dumb one. the tony-dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long, parted haircut and even the second-tier status.

crispin glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. he gives layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. as well as feck, which role is done very well by dennis hopper. it's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult. rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers. i really enjoyed it watching. i saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice 80s feel, this is the one that you have to see. i'ts a same that i didn't know of it earlier.

i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie. it was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom "hahaha, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid".um. yeah. turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say watch this movie! it is just.....bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then. this is a good "human interest" and showcases some strange sides of the psyche.

i have seen this movie three times. going back to vcr's, in the 1980's, and again on the encor channel last night (feb.11, 2010). based on a true story which i remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, i've decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again. yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. the creepiest character is joshua john miller, who plays keeanu reeves little brother. (the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet -- just google it. it's about anthony jacques broussard who murdered marcy conrad in milpitas, california, in 1981.) the characters portray generation x pre-grunge, borderline sociopaths, with the exception of keeanu reeves, who grows a conscience.old hippies did a great job raising that generation.for such a young kid, i thought joshua miller was excellent, as the serial killer in the making character. in actuality, he went to yale, and has written screenplays as well as directed. his acting capabilities in this film were amazing. just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll, and tearing up her dolls grave, gave me the shivers. it gave me nightmares. even with whats happening in our world today, in 2010, it still is the most degenerate film i've seen to date. the apathy, and dysfunction, of these families, is enough to make one puke. this thrill kill almost makes the manson murders pale in comparison. crispon glover got a little too much into character. he wound up on david lettermen to discuss his role, and almost kicked the host in the head. apparrently glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. also, fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper. you're one of the best!

unlike the many who have posted here, i'm not movie literate. i stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing), and couldn't surf away. this is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it. the actors are terrific. tatiana is beautiful and innocent. her fianc√© boris is sweet and patriotic. you couldn't help but feel boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.others have summarized the movie so well, so i'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. when boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" tatiana, tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother, or worse, show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence. since this isn't "french existential cinema", the latter doesn't happen. thankfully! another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris' father of the death of his son. he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana. i can't describe the sorrow of this scene... still,tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home. the musician actually never saw boris buried, after all.i won't mention more scenes, but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. no doubt he gets at least a "tenner" at the conclusion of the film! the ending, when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. you don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.incredible. go see it.

the aftermath of world war two almost resulted in the death of soviet cinema. in the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951}, and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. following the death of joseph stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years. it wasn't until 1957 that director mikhail kalatozov and writer viktor rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely-considered the first post-stalin soviet masterpiece, 'letyat zhuravli / the cranes are flying,' one of the finest depictions of war i've seen from any country or time period. not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the soviet union, but international recognition was soon to follow, and kalatozov's film was honoured with the palm d'or at the 1958 cannes film festival.'the cranes are flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious, humanistic portrayal of war. unlike many soviet war-themed films of the time, it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war-time hero, and more concerned with the futility, brutality and, indeed, the inevitability of conflict. love, as a cinematic concept, is too-often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship, and yet the reality is substantially less romantic. in the film, two lovers, veronika (tatyana samojlova) and boris (aleksey batalov), separated by the advent of the wwii {widely known in the soviet union as the great patriotic war, 1941-1945}, pledge to marry after the war, but tragedy denies the couple their wish. driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting, veronika agrees to wed boris' cousin, mark (aleksandr shvorin), a handsome but unworthy youth. the film may conclude with the proud victory of the soviets, and a patriotic flag-waving parade, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist, who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowds.perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'the cranes are flying' is sergei urusevsky's inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography, which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades {in fact, only one of the film's sequences joins boris on the eastern front}, but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind. in one particularly impressive, oft-cited long shot, the camera follows veronika as she frantically searches for boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. the hand-held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus, jostles through the crowd alongside her - capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands - before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks, a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war, and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand-held photography: "the camera," he once declared, "can express what the actor is unable to portray: his inner sensations. the cameraman must act with the actors."

this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (a few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) a simple story - in moscow on the eve of war between russia and germany in ww ii veronika (tatiana samoilova) is in love with boris (aleksei batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. boris leaves for the front before veronika can tell him she loves him. boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to veronika or his family. mark, boris' cousin, rapes veronika who feels obligated to marry him. degraded and demeaned by the cowardly mark, veronika clings to the hope that someday boris will return. superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director kalatozov. (for anyone interested in film technique another movie by kalatozov, i am cuba, has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) superb acting, particularly by samoilova and vasili merkuryev (as boris' uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement. a devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by samoilova. (this movie is frequently linked with the other russian classic ballad of a soldier.)

russian actress tatiana samoilova reminds me so much of the young audrey hepburn and the camera in the cranes are flying seems to love her just as much. she is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of world war ii in moscow.the film is almost poetic in its gorgeous b&w cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place, since i had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on tcm.it's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime russia. she's unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart.by the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. there's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families.the stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film, as well as the honestly played story.tastefully done, but perhaps the english subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over.summing up: easy to see why it won awards at the cannes film festival. reminded me, in style, of another great russian film, ballad of a soldier.

while watching this film recently, i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957..........and in the ussr! that makes it all the more remarkable. many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. i first saw this film in 1963, when it was first released in the us, and i was struck by its originality then. now just having seen it 40 years later, i have no reason to change my mind.

the many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. we'd 100% recommend it, then, for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen, and can talk about it with others afterwards, as our audience did.the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding. of course, finney and courtenay were truly the stars. but everybody was thoroughly well cast. for our afternoon audience, the majority of whom are "senior citizens", the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-techy use of camera and sound was a great influencehow delightful, many said, to see a really great film that's british: still not dated twenty years on: not full filled with blood & guts: not confusing because of bob-about-all-over-the-place camera shots, and back and forth through time story lines: no seedy sex scenes. such views were even uttered by some who were younger.

i had long wanted to watch this romantic drama (with a wwii setting) and, now that i have, all i can say is that it's a veritable masterpiece of russian cinema! soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but, thankfully, this one's free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl, doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he'll never return. the girl (a remarkable performance from tatyana samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and, when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend, gives in to the latter and marries him. he, however, is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and, knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier, begins to neglect her. finally, word reaches the girl of her loved one's death but, by the end of the film, she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him.the film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and, by frequently adopting tracking, tilted and high or low angle shots, renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama. individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the stunning scene, frenetically edited and sped-up to boot, in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young man's premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind i've ever watched (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that's seeping out of his body, as he imagines the wedding day he'll never have!). also notable, however, is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that's been hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!disappointingly, the r1 dvd of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair (the ruscico edition features a few supplements but, being an export, tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot!); criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed russian classic, ballad of a soldier (1959) - which my pal at the local dvd rental outlet has told me is forthcoming... the only other film i've watched from this director is the arctic epic the red tent (1969; albeit via the much-shorter u.s.-release version!), a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of the cranes are flying, i regret missing out now on his famous documentary i am cuba (1964) a number of times when i was in hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run, it was shown more than once on tv accompanied by a feature-length "making of"!!

this new movie by jeskid is awesome! check it out and you'll be amazed. the story of emily waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. the music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict. directed by jesse cowell and animated by erica langworthy, starring the beautiful marissa parness, with music by nico audy-rowland, daniel collins, jeff strathearn, matt sisco, and selcuk bor. support this film and support jeskid, he is a very talented guy. go see his film shades of grey as well.

a true masterpiece of the soviet cinematography. it's a shame for the soviet union that samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the western movies -- but then again, she would probably never find herself there. in "letyat zhuravli", she is unforgettable. this was one of the few movies where i was crying...in addition to samojlova, batalov and merkurjev, who are top rate, it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all-time classics world-wide. just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy german bombardment, or the death of boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies. the very simple means -- but the great technique added to the emotional weight... mind you, 20 years before "the star wars", 41 years before "titanic", and with a soviet budget.

jesse yet again delivers, after almost 12 months of hype about his upcoming production it finally reaches the dark world of the internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur film making.dbp is a original, nail-biting commentary on a troubled child growing into an even more troubled adult. if i had more than two thumbs, i would give more, but i think two will be enough.great work from all cast, especially by marissa and elizabeth, the character of emily as an adult has given me shivers so far and i'm afraid of where she'll go next.an excellent watch

this was a modern tv classic! the story goes like this, bob has a girlfriend named alicia. bob and alicia are in love and want to get married. bob has a bud named owen who he works with. owen is jealous of alicia. he likes hanging around with bob. now owen hangs around with bob and alicia. bob and owen have a secretary named heather. heather is very accident prone. she is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. she too hangs around with bob and alicia, and owen. sometimes alicia wishes bob didn't have any friends.by the end of the first season, it looked like owen finally found himself a real longlasting girlfriend. bob and alicia went driving on the night before their wedding, making out in a tiny car and then getting stuck. way out in the middle of nowhere! what happened next? what about poor heather? did anyone get married?? sorry, series ended.not even a plea from tv guide made fox think twice about putting it back on the air. it was a great show with a great cast. i loved heather too. she looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. i miss this show a lot. this is like reading a good book with the ending missing......sad.

i enjoyed this show, it was on in the uk, but not at peak time, and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so i wasn't able to watch them all. i was surprised when it didn't return and had no i idea why, still don't know, but i guess that's not important.great performances from the two leads, they were very believable as friends. the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred, friends being the obvious main one, but sex in the city came along a few years later.the characters, get take out coffee, they drink at nice bars , that sort of thing, a little woody allenish in a way.

jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men, which he perfected in this series. he longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. in one of the funniest lines on tv ever -- i think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl. his partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting: "what's the worst that can happen? she says no."armed with newfound optimism, he proposes to his date over dinner. to which she replies, "god, no!"i laughed so hard i cried.

`rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. the film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. the story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band judas priest. if you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. however, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of jennifer aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. i could not say the same about the rock star himself; mark wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. i did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes. it reminded me of my teenage years where everything `smelled like teen spirit'. i guess the film is worth a viewing, but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some `girls, girls, girls.' *** average

this is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'the wedding singer'. whilst the 'wedding singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'rock star' is all about metal.mark wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and jennifer aniston plays his girlfriend. when his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.the story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of rock'n roll! the music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! the whole concert feeling is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here).great direction and a brilliant performance by marky mark, who acts like a true metal dude!'rock star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you are going to love this movie!10/10

i loved this movie. it is a very simple plot and from what i understand it is based on a true story. growing up in the 80's with hard rock/hair metal may have something to do with my love of this film but even aside from the music it is a really fun movie to watch. give it a try, you will like it unless you are the hardest of critics and only like movies of "citizen kane" caliber.

if you wish to see shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, i suggest you find this bbc version. indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but jacoby's performance as hamlet and patrick stewart's as claudius are well worth the effort.it never ceases to amaze me how clear "hamlet" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard. every film version of "hamlet" has tinkered with its structure. olivier concentrated on hamlet's indecision, gibson on his passions. jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet's character together with the aid of shakespeare's full script.why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately? hamlet says "i am very proud, revengeful, ambitious..." hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet. he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself. he is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. and this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so. he must "out" the king's secret and here is the tragedy! at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. why? he wants it all! he wants revenge, the throne and the damnation of claudius' soul in hell. hamlet overreaches himself in classic tragic form. his own hubris is his undoing. he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz, guildenstern, ophelia, laertes, gertrude, claudius and hamlet himself.

absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close. jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it. patrick stewart's claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic -- i particularly like the two doofuses playing rosencranz and guildenstern. very feckless and yet sinister. some might gripe about the need for a strong ophelia -- she's not a strong person, that's the point, and lalla ward hits the proper nuances. amazing. simply amazing -- every one of the more than two dozen times i've watched it.

i saw this version of hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie. however, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me. most excellent derek jacobi made hamlet *real* for me. before i saw this version, shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and i never tried to understand the elizabethan english. having seen jacobi's hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family. i promptly checked the play out of library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording. jacobi's rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge. and yet, i have been searing for a video of it for years and years to no avail. it gets a very high rating from viewers. why, then, has it not been released on video? it's the only hamlet that i'd invest in...

i have seen all the film interpretations of hamlet, from sir lawrence olivier to mel gibson (gasp). derek jacobi captures the true essence of the character, from the beginning to the brutal climax. superb acting all around. this one should not be missed.

this production of hamlet, prince of denmark is by far the best that i have seen. although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it does have the most important element: sir derek jacobi as hamlet.jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed prince is multi-layered and riveting. his displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow, love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or over-the-top. in fact, some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression. as to whether or not he interprets hamlet as mad or sane...well, you should decide for yourselves; i changed my mind more than once. at one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness, but suspects that he is actually mad after all...a revelation to himself, captured beautifully. having performed the part of hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history, jacobi's affinity for the role then comes as little surprise.as for the production itself, it is presented as a kind of "filmed-copy" of the stage play, with little special effects or fancy camera work, minimal sets and no musical accompaniment to speak of. this production relies on the acting prowess of the cast, and the words of shakespeare, to evoke the emotion and interest of its audience. and it works. the other players are top-notch as well, particularly patrick stewart's "claudius" and claire bloom's "gertrude." together the cast present a seamless ensemble.the last (but far from least) element that makes this production stand out is the play itself. here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on film. but, oddly enough, i never noticed the time. i was too busy getting caught up in the story. i suspect that you will, too.

i've seen various hamlets, and i've taught the play. as i watch jacobi, i'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. he deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding hamlet's character. he illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. at the same time, however, we cringe at the horror hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else. and we shudder at hamlet's own betrayals, because jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which hamlet can descend. in short, jacobi gives us hamlet in full, and hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature. that's why i'm satisfied that jacobi's hamlet is the finest performance i've seen by an actor.

caught this film on tcm in the early a.m. it was amazing.starting out slow but ominously.... scott is a shady character who preys on women. in this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in southern california.the sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing. the title may have been more creative, but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a hitchcockian version.scott reminded me of the character uncle charley in "shadow of a doubt", one of hitch's reputed favorite films. the audience learns,we truly do not know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind.this film is a displaced gem and well-worth purchasing. 10/10.

this is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. while not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. the scene where zachary scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. it defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades. he lies easily as the situation calls for, and captivates the women in the fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile.i couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of mildred pierce. scott and bruce bennett were teamed again, and faye emerson bears some resemblance to joan crawford, with her facial bone structure and large eyes. also, the mona freeman character is not unlike the odious veda in mildred pierce.i agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat, with the convenient tumble over a cliff for "ronnie mason", zachary scott's character. also, in one of the final scenes, we see bratty mona freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older, smoother zachary scott. i think the script should've called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister, instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode. but these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well-made movie.

between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, zachary scott made 70 films. he was introduced in 1944 in jean negulesco's 'the mask of dimitrios', where he played dimitrios. the next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. he is best remembered by cineastes as the star of jean renoir's 'the southerner', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. however, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money. so what happens here? he lives in a house with three women, so watch out! faye emerson, who also appeared in 'dimitrios', plays the older of two daughters in the house. she falls in love with scott and they become secretly engaged. then her 'cute kid' younger sister (played effectively by mona freeman, who resembles bonita granville both in looks and in behaviour) returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with scott that she has inherited a tidy sum, so scott turns his sights on her instead, with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse. things get tense, and then they get tenser. meanwhile, plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating scott. but it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. he is also being searched for as a result of his last kill, with which the film has opened, so that we know his back story. james wong howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale, which was directed by frenchman robert florey who had moved to hollywood some time earlier. the film is an effective psychopath-in-the-house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats, for those of such an inclination.

robert florey and james wong howe gave this a frightening, expressionistic look. scenes are shot at weird angles -- especially scenes involving figurative and literal lady-killer zachary scott. his sociopathic behavior presages another superb, medium-budget movie, "the stepfather," by more than two decades.the entire cast is excellent, though (though no fault of her own) it's hard to think of joyce compton as anyone but the singer in "the awful truth.") scott, bennett, emerson, decamp (especially, and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous) -- they couldn't have been topped.setting a creepy lodger-in-the-house-of women story against a background of psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. nothing corny at all.beautifully. nothing corny at all.the resolution is a little pat, unfortunately. not emerson's getting together with bennett. that makes sense. but scott is dispatched too quickly. i seem him more as a mr. ripley character, who could have escaped everything -- the botulism, the murder rap, the jealous sisters -- and disappeared into the great world beyond this story. that would not have impeded the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally getting together.

zachary scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in "danger signal," a 1945 b movie also starring faye emerson, mona freeman, and rosemary decamp. scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. on the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the fenchurch family, hilda (emerson) and her mother (mary servoss). scott throws himself at emerson, and she's dazzled. mid-romance, her younger sister anne (freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. when she mentions that she was uncle wade's favorite and he left her $25,000 (big bucks by 1945 standards), scott loses interest in poor hilda and makes a play for anne. anne looks like rebecca of sunnybrook farm until she starts sneaking around with scott - overnight, she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister. finally getting the message that her tenant is no good, hilda calls in a psychiatrist (rosemary decamp) to psyche him out and advise her.psychological dramas were all the rage during and after world war ii, and scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath. this was his forte - as a weak-willed sheriff in "flamingo road," he exhibited no real presence. as for two-timing, we saw him do that in "mildred pierce," where he proved himself particularly good at it. emerson is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses, but after hours, she's lovely, and gives a strong performance. decamp was always an underrated actress - here, she sports a soft german accent and is delightful.this is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story. the acting truly elevates it.

this film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. fay emerson,(hilda fenchurch) who was married twice to the famous musician skitch henderson and also the son of elliott roosevelt, (fdr's son) fell madly in love with zachary scott( ronnie mason/marsh). ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even mona freeman(anne fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever he can. rosemary decamp (dr. jane silla)(famous radio and tv actress in the 30's and 40's played mostly small town mom's) warned the ladies about ronnie mason's sick mind, and the abusive childhood he had when growing up, which caused his love/hate relationship with women. fay emerson and zachary scott would have been greater stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short lived in real life. this film is beyond critizing, it is a trully great 1945 film classic for many generations to view and enjoy!

this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far. i would put it only second to all about lily chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes....'9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at mount fuji primary school. they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways. the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated. it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey. the second half, moved me to tears. as the movie progresses, each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams, but unfortunately ending somewhat badly. in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left. the way that each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. a beautiful film directed fantastically. this is a movie for people who have enjoyed toshiaki toyoda's other films such as 'blue spring'.

i watched "9 souls" in athens' 12th international film festival (september 2006), where toshiaki toyoda, the films's director was also present and answered many questions of the audience. this road film is about 9 fugitives, all very different characters from each other. they decide to stay together travelling with their red van across japan. every time the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape from their past in order to build up a new life or to fulfil a dream. however, no matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction.though a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark film. on the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humor. toyoda's heroes cannot escape their "prison" and they face a divine(?) punishment for their "crimes". they are small pieces of a beautiful painting, where the tower of tokyo depicted as a huge knife turned upside down prevails!

a great film. every moment masterfully conducted by toyoda and his crew. the actors give credible performances all around.the visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the japanese country and city landscapes.the sounds,courtesy of japanese band 'dig', are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. it's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on. all in all, they worked everything out perfectly....well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. the real greatness of 9 souls is the compelling story. the prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days, and road trip movie losing it's appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller. but this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genres.9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. will society accept them? will they be truly free of their dark pasts? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? each convict has an interesting history. their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates. a sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations. and due to the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something waiting to happen.after all that, all i can say is go give it a watch.

highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies. great acting, perfectly surreal awkward humor, requisite prison sh-t, accurate depiction of the male condition. music is also spot-on. i think the artist is "dip" but not sure. the short loop of the title credit song on the dvd menu is well-timed, and sounds like slint.

when a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. what soon follows is not surprising. complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. it seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.loosely based on the great escape, 9 souls is by far in the top 5 best films i've seen this year. running at right around 2 hours 9 souls will deliver a story so powerful it'll literally leave you breathless. the beautiful, yet subtle, use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story. the vision of director toshiaki toyoda (blue spring, porno star), is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters. as quickly as each character grasps their dream, it's as quick as it's torn from them. now, all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director, yet props must go to the actors as well. this film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. ryuhei matsuda (the son of miyuki matsuda of audition) delivers a stellar performance, and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen.i must give props to artsmagic dvd as well. this is the 6th film of theirs i've seen now, and they seem to get better and better each dvd. the sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and crisp. it's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer, so the discs from theses cats are nice.bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers' world wide. keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 souls; it's really amazing film to watch.

to be totally honest i wasn't expecting much at all going into 9 souls even after reading heap upon heap of praise plied upon it but to say i was surprised would be a major understatement, in short i was totally blown away.the basic plot is as simple as they come, nine prison inmates ranging from a drug pusher all the way up to multiple murderer's escape from prison and go in search of a secret stash presumed to be forged money hidden by a tenth inmate who cracked and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape but it's the direction that director toshiaki toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly blending drama, comedy and violence creating a truly one of kind movie that deserve's to be seen not only fans of asian cinema but cinema in general.superbly acted, emotional, funny, violent and at times very surreal this is a movie has it all.

finally! third time lucky. this film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it, so i decided i would record it. only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick. i wasn't going to allow that to happen again. so, when it came on tv again, i thought bugger it i'll wait until it comes on, then i will record it. and it was a good choice. i would have just watched the film, but they always put on weeknights around midnight. after discovering a hole in their crowded cell, nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe, which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden. they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled. although things don't turn out the way that they intended to, with most of the criminals plans going astray. "9 souls" is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada, which flung it's viewers into a film of two totally different halves. the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point, but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence drama-packed second half, where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with. while, the first half is quite amusing with its on the road, screwball doodling and offbeat banter. but it's really the genuinely haunting latter half with it's peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters. even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes, you just become entrenched by these flesh-out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall, you know it's an effective drama when you become shell-shocked in the dramatic change. the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down. the way the plot works out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives. the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that's clear in it's goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints. while, the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. the visual element doesn't go by unnoticed, because there's just a dreamy and trance-like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly, moody instrumental rock soundtrack. the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke. simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. the pacing for such an long film ( 2 hours ) seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done, because we are just so wrapped up in it all. the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. while, the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves. i found "9 souls" to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. highly recommended.

what i got was something better.just like many movies i've commented on as of recently, i'd been looking forward to this one for a while. especially after i saw one of toshiaki toyoda's other films, "blue spring" which is easily in my top 20 favorite films. i loved the trailer for "9 souls", and i thought it sounded very good. i didn't hear anything bad about it. now i know why.this movie starts up as sort of a comedy, then during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else. it becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own tragedies. each character gets just enough screen time, and you care about what happens to each of them. even though there are 9 characters we have to learn, and care about, within just two hours, toshiaki toyoda pulls it off brilliantly.after i saw "blue spring" i was hoping the soundtrack would be at least a little bit as good, as it was in that film. i got my wish, because the soundtrack to "9 souls" was also incredible. the music used in each scene, more specifically the more dramatic ones, is just simply wonderful. i loved every second of it.i wasn't sure whether or not i wanted to see another toshiaki toyoda film, "pornostar", but after i saw this, i'm going to. definitely. also, because i read the plot for it, and i think it sounds really good. i'm looking forward to it. on the r1 dvd of "9 souls", there are two interviews with toyoda. he says he's completed another film, and he wants to start writing the screenplay for his next. i can't wait for both.i highly recommend this film. you must see it. now.

the third film i got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from japan. after breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the "key to the universe" that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about. along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well. each has their own dreams. for much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy. all of the actors give great performances. i can't say much more without spoiling the film, but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals. at 2 hours, this film is a tad to long, but good none the less. i have no qualms recommending it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender-hearted. toshiaki toyoda hit a home-run this time out, and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones.my grade: a

"the dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom courtenay. how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while (of course, they gave the award that year to "terms of endearment"-- after all, they don't want to be accused of showing too much taste).albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of "king lear"; tom courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights. it's both hilarious and piteous to see courtenay's character showering finney's with attention and affection, only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed, even up to the very bitter end. finney and courtenay work wonders together, and though finney gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite shakespeare after all), courtenay is the heart and soul of the film.grade: a

this is one of the best martial art(kung-fu) movies of all time. if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss. from flying nuns to training monks this movie has top kungfu styles and a good story line. its about a priest from the wu dang clan trying to eliminate all the shaoulin fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts. after killing key members of the shaoulin temple the faith of the shoulin is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a shaoulin monk. the white abbot or the priest from the wu dang clan develops new techniques that turn him into iron. well this a not to miss classic. it involves ninjas, shaoulin and nuns fighters. it a great classic

i've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.the story begins with a duel between a righteous shaolin priest and our villain abbot white, needless to say, abbot white kicks buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet). the rest of the story concerns the training of the disciples of the shaolin monks killed by abbot white, one of whom is alexander lo rei. whilst we are treated to the punishing training sequences the two young avengers must go through to learn the shaolin finger jab technique needed to defeat abbot white's invincible armour technique, we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shape...mostly using taoist magic to extract the blood from naked ladies. we all know how this is going to end, but it's the psychedelic trip in between that we're here for. in conclusion, this is a good example of what taiwan was doing when hong kong was getting sick of martial arts movies, and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies. this movie is very well choreographed, has some nudity, some gore and enough balls to the wall gimickry to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained. visit your local beewise today!

alexander lou, star of classics such as 'the super ninja' and 'mafia vs ninja' headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest.the plot involves the evil abbott white (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the shaolin temple.this goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members, although needless to say, one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant abbott.....ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like 'wu tang vs ninja' aka 'the ninja hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? of course not! - it's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! there's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.if your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see!

ninja hunter (aka wu tang vs ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters, nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever. the makers of this film have given us a truly ott masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed.the plot centres around wu tang villain, abbot white, who wants to destroy the shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. in order to do so, he teams up with a clan of ninjas, led by three masters ¬ñ gold lam√© ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja ¬ñ and succeeds in destroying the shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants. however, there are some survivors. it is their job to pass on the knowledge of the shaolin finger jab to a new generation, who must defeat the ninjas and abbott white if peace and order is to be restored.unfortunately, abbott white is a difficult foe to beat, since he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks (an excuse for some welcome gratuitous nudity!).other treats in store for viewers include loads of very impressive fighting (despite some of it being speeded up), some really amazing outfits (the aforementioned gold lam√© ninja, abbott white's yin yang suits, and even some assassins wearing swastika tunics), a ninja turning into a flying carpet, plus some cheesy gore for good measure. and i nearly forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on display in this movie ¬ñ surely a good reason not to pass up on this gem.

without doubt, grand champion has the most impressive cast of "aaa" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, "g" rated family adventure. this is a must buy for every video collection! director barry tubb skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4h competition for the "grand champion" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. joey lauren adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old emma roberts, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, julia. you can expect a lot from this young roberts-prot√©g√©' as is already proving itself in her new, hit nickelodeon series, "unfabulous."

first i am a teenager. ok, and i have to say this movie was pretty good. i think any kid ten and under will like it, but people my age an up might be a little, um, a, well, we'd describe the movie as lame! but i liked it. it may be that i still act like a kid, or i visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. i did like how the actors were like kids, not little blonde cutesy pies, wearing three layers of clothes, a trendy hat, and about a thousand assecories (like most shows today, to name a few, drake & josh, lizzie mc guire, well any kid show.) and the setting was perfect, but there was a flaw. the family was in debt, right? why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a "western" versace store? that was one flaw.the cameos are great, there's about five hundred of them, and the only explainable one is julia roberts being the main little girl's aunt. how in the world did they get everyone else? this movie seemed to be on a tight type budget.i liked this movie, it was a fun one to watch, and i thought some parts were far fetched (like a cow selling for $750,000? ha! my butt a cow sells for that much!) but otherwise it was good, i liked it, and i could watch it again. but i'd never buy it, there's not even special features on the dvd! what's up with that? but do rent it, especially if you have little kids running around the house.

i had the privilege of being one of the still photographers on the set of "grand champion" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days i worked on the movie. i have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and i can't think of a time when i enjoyed providing my craft more. the kids were wonderful to work with and little emma roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. she even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. some of her images were used for pr. i could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget but i doubt i would have had the fun and been around so many great actors and the great people of west texas as i was.

i have watched grand champion all the way through at least twice now. i enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. it is refreshing to see a g rated movie. this is a feel good movie. the story is mostly from the view of the children. the interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. i recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. if you liked the little rascals, you will probably enjoy this. i viewed this movie on cable. either on encore or showtime family. this is not a movie that i would have gone to see at the theatre. but, i only go to the theatre for the effects of the big screen, so most comedies, romantic films, or dramas i do not go for big screen-i wait for tv/cable edition. get your kids together, pop some popcorn and enjoy!

we all enjoyed the movie. it is a very charming family film with many fun cameos. it was fun to see austin musicians, charlie robison, joe ely and robert earl keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors julia roberts and bruce willis. emma roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good. the west texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of texas artists. the last half seemed a bit far fetched to me, however, my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him. something in the storyline was captivating for children. having shown calves as a child, i really liked the ending. that is definitely not the way it really works unless you have heifers.

it was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film...grand champion. the story of a 12 year old boy (buddy) that with the help of his sister, mom and best friend is determined to raise a grand champion steer. it is a whimsical journey to the big competition. after hokey pokey is crowned, grand champion, he is auctioned for $775,000. to pay for the kids college education. buddy finds out that the next time he sees hokey....it would be on a bun! the kids conspire to steal the prize winning steer,vowing to save him from the bbq. this is where the fun begins...julia roberts, larry mahan, george strait, natalie maines, steven bland, tommy guy, tuff hedeman, and so many more stars create the backdrop for all the antics. you wont believe who actually won the steer at the auction!!! (he looks good in a mustache) the soundtrack is rich with tunes from george strait, natalie maines, willie nelson and more. where else can you experience movie stars, country & western stars and rodeo stars....only in texas...only in grand champion. it is masterfully crafted "simple" little film that may be the best movie you see this year. the movie opens in select cities on friday, august 27th. 2004.another great film from rope the moon and michaelson productions is in a whisper. keep an eye out on the cable networks for this one!

this is the kind of movie that i grew up on. it is great family fun, that the kids love and the parents enjoy as well. i wish more films like this were made. it's a great story about a little boy who raises a bull with his mother and sister, and shows it all the way up to the national grand championship, where he wins! then he's scared that someone's going to barbecue his bull, so he kidnaps it and heads home with it. i was really excited when i first saw this film in the theater and was surprised to see george strait, julia roberts and bruce willis in this little film. the music was great with all kinds of huge country names like willie nelson and the dixie chicks. anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie, doesn't have any children or never was a kid them self.

everybody interested in texas needs to have this dvd. it's just a good movie about real texas with great scenes. it took a bunch of texans to do this right. hollywood never would have gotten it. there are so many subtle things that tubb put in the movie and may not have even thought about, but it makes the show.guest cameos are not seen as cameos at all. each star fits in perfectly and does not distract from the film. many of the guests spots blend so perfect that when the credits roll you will go back through the movie to find the character. strait's roll is dead on, it could not have been done any better in real life.the second half of the movie is completely different from the first, it get's a little "hokey", but that's alright. somehow the storyline works. the "hokey" stuff is like an after school special but it looks believable and natural.i have never heard anyone use the sonny pruitt line before, other than locals that i grew up with. that was the icing on the cake for me.definitely a collectible, right up there with pure country, sugarland express, jr. bonner, texasville, the last picture show, giant, and of course hud.gig'em aggies '86

my mom and i went to the ft worth premiere mainly to see george strait, but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at bass hall. what a wonderful, beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful texas landscape, but also had a great feel-good storyline. it was well written, directed and produced and my mom and i loved it from start to finish!. thank you jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. it was a night we will never forget. as if seeing the movie was not enough, we also were fortunate enough to be sitting 4 rows in front of my favorite singer, george strait!! thank you, thank you, thank you!! keep up the great work and again, thank you!debbie mcclendon & maureen daugherty ft. worth, tx

i loved this movie. my daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. there are not any movies for young children. i loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said "stupid". i applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. i rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. my daughter can not stop talking about it. it goes along with our lifestyle. we live in east texas. i hope to see more family films like this one. she even named one of our calves "hokey pokey keen"!!! i can not say enough about this movie. i look forward to many more films like this one.

not all movies are oscar worthy but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. this one left me smiling and happy and i couldn't wait to hug my own son. anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth. bruce willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and joey lauren adams was convincing as a good mother. the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend edgar played terrific backup roles. liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy. thanks!

my children, dd 7 and ds 10, enjoyed the movie so much they were squirming in their seats. it was good, old fashioned, rated g, family fun. this movie was made for kids.... someone really understands them.it was fun to see julia roberts, brice willis, garth brooks and the other stars make their cameo appearances.as someone who lives in the city the fictional "big texas" was modeled after, i can say that they did an honest and accurate portrayal. the kids looked like kids, not like superstars.i hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to hollywood that we need more movies like this. go see it, then spread the word!

went to the preview engagement of "grand champion" today (dallas/fort worth, austin, snyder and a couple of other texas cities). there are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. though the plot is a little "hokey" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. and i enjoyed it, too. the film pretty well represents west texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. director/author barry tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment. he called the film his "love letter to texas." joey lauren adams plays the single mom of buddy (jacob fisher) and sister 'blow' (emma roberts). watch emma roberts (julia roberts' niece); she's very good and i think she will be in more films. there are also cameo appearances from julia roberts, bruce willis, musicians george strait, charlie robison, robert earl keen, joe ely and rodeo legends larry mahan and tuff hedeman.if you have young children or just want to see a feel-good movie, check out "grand champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). y'all will enjoy it and it will make you feel good.i guess since i'm from west texas, i might be a little biased...nah, i'm impartial. the film is excellent!

grand champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. andrew morton at the fort worth star telegram said it best "if walt disney had hailed from texas, he would have made grand champion" the movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. the kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. i bet bruce willis and julia roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (g rated) this is a masterfully crafted "simple" little film made in texas by texas barry tubb. take your kids, take your kids friends, take grandma too....they will all enjoy it and you will too.

this is a new barbie movie. the graphics were really good. they made the movie seem partially realistic. i used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. this movie was kind of like a cinderella movie but a little bit different. a father of 12 princesses gets very sick. his cousin poisons him and wants the throne. the girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories. its up to them to save their father and society. with the help of their handsome prince. it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it. we enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the indian talking parrot. the music was very nice and made the movie even greater. it had a great classical orchestra. the voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute. i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family. all in all i'd watch it again.

i have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is princess genevieve, and all her sisters. i definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. this movie is one of the best from the barbie collection. it shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. with the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. the extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is. i would definitely have say it is a must see for kids and grown-ups alike.

i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. they may have faults, but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. try to find that on tv or in the usual movies. it is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. contrast that with the apparel in stores today, i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets, etc. the story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting. i know that it is animated, but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay. i would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike.

i thought this movie was perfect for little girls. it was about a magical place where genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like. most little girls would like this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls would not understand it, so it adds up to make a perfect story. all the events add up, creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough. this story is perfect for little girls, and since it is a barbie movie, the kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have barbies of their own. anyone can have fun with it, though, because it is so cute and understandable. overall, i think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially little girls, and will give anyone a smile at least once during it.

this movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. my nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result i've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. i can't get enough of it. the cgi images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices. just keep in mind that it is a barbie movie, and, though cheesy at times, in my experience, this one lives up to the high standard which the other barbie princess movies have set for it. i would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. it teaches a good lesson as well. everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.

this is a nicely-done story with pretty music, lots of dancing, lots of big sister/little sister interaction (almost all of it positive), and lots of wishes granted. there are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy, such as when king randolph exclaims, "they're just shoes! aren't they?" and tender moments such as when princess genevieve comforts her youngest sister, lacey, after a blunder.the animation is perhaps not as good as disney, but it still is very good. the facial expressions are nuanced, particularly for genevieve, king randolph, duchess rowena and her servant, derek the cobbler, and little princess lacey. my only quibble on the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies of each other without the slightest deviation -- even the three youngest copy the dance steps perfectly. i would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dancing, considering that these girls are not professional ballerinas or chorus dancers.the resolution of the story is handled cleverly to get rid of a villainess without actually hurting her. there is some violence done to guards in the story, and the villainess's monkey is mean to other animals in the story.my 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and has watched it repeatedly, and i have found it to be quite acceptable for her to watch.

i missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. i had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what i saw. i left the theater thinking i had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.the full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.the problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess. there are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. shots of people in a city that go on much too long with no purpose in the narrative. we get beautiful vistas and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes but they are used too frequently as a place holder instead of as punctuation or to set a place. much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good.i've attempted to actually sit down and watch heavens gate with out resorting to the fast forward button but somewhere along the way i find i can't stand it any more.i wish mgm would take pity on us and release the shorter version to dvd as well as the huge dinosaur. perhaps as a two pack so that we could see which is the better version, and whether cimino was mad or not.and while they were at it why not include the once rumored johnson county war edit that ran 90 minutes. supposedly united artists tinkered with a further cut in the hopes of getting some of their money back. whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air, but it would be interesting to see.

though this film destroyed director and screenwriter michael cimino's career and bankrupted united artists, it still stands as one of the top movies of all time. there are plenty of reasons to prematurely dismiss this movie for sure. among them: its length, its technical problems, its colossal mistreatment of animals on set -- the list goes on and on. and yet, for all of this, it remains a film that captures something. it is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling on par with strindberg -- its moments lasting as long as they might in reality, having not been dumbed down for good cinematic timing. it feels real in its moments of anger, love, and war (and hopelessness). this film should be seen by any person who appreciates film and storytelling.

i actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then the deer hunter, which was overrated. both this movie and year of the dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. at three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. kris kristofferson and christopher walken are fighting over isabelle huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with. sam waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed who is says are anarchists and thieves. there is a great cast that also has jeff bridges, brad dourif and a young mickey rourke.

if this film had been directed by dw griffith or stanley kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm. it is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. and of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output. its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. they even appear to be thinking, something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide, so they destroyed it. see the original uncut wide-screen version. it is stunning.

this great film never showed up in my town, so actually i didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when i caught it on german television. i was expecting something of a disaster, and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. the tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film, so i hope to see it once again on the big screen. what a spectacle that would be! don't miss it, if you ever have the chance. unfortunately the harsh treatment of "heaven's gate" at its opening ruined michael cimino's career and he moved from the passable ("year of the dragon") to the boringly ludicrous ("the sicilian") and the screechingly dumb ("desperate hours").

stephen sondheim's sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with len cariou and angela lansbury in the leading roles. although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. the result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring george hern, who replaced cariou, and lansbury in a close approximation of the original broadway staging.there is, however, a flaw. simply stated: stage plays do not film very well, for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very, very large--and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static, oppressively aggressive, or both. sweeney todd is no exception. seen on film, it has a "stand and sing" quality, and while both hern and lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with betsy joslyn as joanna; her larger-than-life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast.taking this stage-play-on-film effect into consideration, however, this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style. lansbury is astonishing, a mixture of silliness, stupidity, and cunning malice, while hern truly owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients "go to their graves impeccably shaved." the overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set, there is enough on display for it to be impressive. and the music! who can argue with what most consider sondheim's finest work? the story itself is extremely well-known, particularly in england. in 1846 thomas peckett prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story he titled a string of pearls; within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street--and, in an era that knew little of copyright law, variations of the play were soon playing all over england. each one, however, was more or less the same: sweeney todd, a barber, kills the men who come to him for a shave; mrs. lovett, his associate, bakes them up into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. the sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by christopher bond.the story is very grand guignol, with a lot of blood, bodies dropping down chutes, and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, lyrics, and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect. sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more so than here; he intertwines a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet victorian-elegant of his complex music.like the "concert version" starring hern and patti lupone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 tim burton film version, most particularly the opening "attend the tale of sweeney todd," which runs like a thread throughout the play. it is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than the film, which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood. whatever the case, if you are a fan of the story, this is the legendary broadway show on tour, and it is a knock-out. recommended.gft, amazon reviewer

televised in 1982, from a los angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. issued on dvd in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. hearn and lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. of course it is sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. if anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of the american musical form listen to this. the sets are stark, as befits the plot, and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action without obliterating the fact that this is a stage production. a central, move-able and revolving platform is mrs. lovett's pie shop, with the barber's shop upstairs. around it are various gantries and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place. the brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge, murder and mayhem is liberally spiced with dark humour and comic moments. sondheim does for barber shops what hitchcock did for showers ! an important work in american musical theatre is here given an electrifying performance.

well i'm not the world's biggest sondheim fan, so although i have the cast album and i've listened to it a few times i've never actually seen this show performed and i haven't seen the tim burton movie version either. i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. this version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly angela lansbury's performance as nellie lovett. this is one of those performances that's just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself. she must have had so much fun with this role. sweeney todd himself isn't played by len cariou, who did it originally, but by george hearn. hearn does a fantastic job; his voice isn't quite as good as cariou's, but he seems to play it a bit broader.the only problem i had really was with the johanna character as played by betsy joslyn, and to some extent her lover anthony as played by cris groenendaal. joslyn's voice can't sustain high notes, but i wasn't entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since i'm not hugely familiar with this play. more importantly, i'm not sure if the story of "sweeney todd" really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music, but thankfully the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. as a lark, and a bit of comedy in the vein of "grand guignol", it's quite enjoyable. i don't feel like it's as significant a piece of work as "company" and "into the woods" or some of his other shows. some of the music is quite spectacular, but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show.i won't say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film, but just a play that has been shot on film. there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it. people will want to see this, because it preserves lansbury's legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because it's a hilarious and insightful performance. george hearn can be proud of his version of sweeney as well. this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater, because i prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs. "sweeney todd" is an exceptional show from its era however, miles and miles above the al webber madness.

attend the tale of sweeney todd...the strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful broadway musical. it is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. george hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while angela lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. if you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "sweeney todd" is a real treat.

i saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. i just recently found an original vhs version, and purchased it for $125.00. sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.why, it's just a little over paying for a broadway ticket today. i really hope they re-release this in dvd form soon. it's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!

not having seen the 1936 version of this story, i cannot offer any comparison there. i can, however, state that stephen sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. only sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter. if anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and "dr. strangelove" as well). when mrs. lovett goes from having the "worst pies in london" to a booming business with high acclaim, we aren't talking "soylent green," - but the ingredients are similar. particularly brilliant is the song where mrs. lovett pitches her idea to mr. todd. even in the introductory number, the line "...they went to their maker impeccably shaved..." gives a great indication of the premise, the drama, and the comedy to come. outstanding!

i viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. i found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. george hearn, of course,was the master of the role of sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. angela lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as mrs. lovett. she understood that sondheim wanted that role to be something of a "comic" counterpart to sweeney; and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of sweeney and her nurture of the boy tobias. for those with long memories, this performance takes one back to her debut performances in the picture of dorian grey and gaslight; long before murder, she wrote. only a year ago i saw the musical at lyric opera of chicago. with current opera superstar brynn terfel as sweeney. others have commented on the operatic quality of the score. my conclusion is that "sweeney" works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines, than with opera performers who have limited acting skills. as a final note, i commend the performer who portrayed tobias. with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him. it seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word.

i can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. this is the first production i've ever seen of sweeney todd so i have no others to compare it to. but the impact is so strong, i just can't imagine anything better.first, there's the music -- take "johanna" (act ii), during which sweeney, anthony and johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. it's like a bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition. and the underlying chord structure and voicings are so perfect -- a little bit of melancholy, a little bit of contentment, a little bit of yearning, all expressing these three singers' points of view.then -- the lyrics. the rhymes are so clever. the rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end. (the dvd, which i watched, has closed captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating the dialog and the lyrics.) sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone.finally, the performances. i can't imagine anyone better than george hearn. why haven't i heard of him before? his singing, alone, is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply amazing. angela lansbury totally surprised me. the song about "you and me down by the seaside" -- who could do it any better? her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is accounted for; and overlaying this achievement in musicianship is her utterly delightful comic delivery.it's a dark tale but i found it to be sweet at times; and the tune to "johanna" continues to play in my head.

i very much enjoyed this movie and i think most fans of lauren ambrose will too. her character is much softer than her role in six feet under and all of the performances are strong. i especially enjoyed the way the role of emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without clich√© by the actress, taylor roberts. also a standout was fran kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. what maybe worked well as a stage-play didn't hold out quite so well on screen. however the lovely cinematography by paul ryan definitely makes up for that, as well as the pace of the film, which is surprisingly not slow. i recommend this movie to fans of six feet under and also fans of plain good acting and cinematography.

the brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old emily brighton (taylor roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother martha brighton (amy madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. the seventeen years old evie brighton (lauren ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for emily. their father harry brighton (john savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to emily. when martha hears emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to the english teacher stewart worthy (christopher lloyd), who believes that emily has had a moment of geniuses. when evie's only friend james (fran kranz) reads the notes, he immediately discloses the truth about the authority of the poetries. but when martha becomes aware, she finds the reality of evie, triggering a series of revelations."admissions" is a very powerful drama about needy of love and guilty complex. the performances are stunning, and this is the first work of lauren ambrose, from "six feet under", that i see and she is amazing. this independent movie is an excellent choice for the viewers that are looking for a refreshing story based on the acting of the cast. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "cumplicidade" ("complicity")

"admissions" is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending. lauren ambrose plays evie who is trying to avoid college. to make her overworked mother not notice, she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. all the acting is first-rate especially lauren ambrose and amy madigan. they both put in great performances. the climax is also very powerful. there are only two bad parts. first is the character of stewart worthy played by christopher lloyd. his part is underdeveloped. the other weakness is the ending. it goes around in circles, which i didn't expect with the 84 min run time. besides that, the movie is definitely worth watching.

this film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at cinequest in the big california theatre in san jose. it's a musical, which normally i don't like, but i have to say this one was different. robert peters, who directed the film and stared in it, did such a wonderful job. during his q & a he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in germany! i can't say enough great things about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera work and it shakes a bit. if you happen to come across this film- check it out!

"half empty" is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist ¬ñin this case, a self-help book writer who goes to germany mistakenly thinking he's popular there. instead of an adoring audience, he finds himself adrift in a world of jaded misanthropes, including the woman who is supposed to be his publicist. his attempts to make friends¬óin scenes that are largely improvised¬ólead to one great encounter after another when he is verbally abused by nihilistic musicians, gruff gangsters, etc. in time, he manages to win over his publicist¬óboth her heart and her mind--but his own world view is shaken when his hero, a much more popular self-help writer, turns out to be not quite what he seems. the action is punctuated by several musical numbers.we saw this at the deadcenter film festival in oklahoma city and were blown away. this is a really funny, inspired small-scale indie production. you could quibble about a few technical things (like the lighting, which is a bit dark) but the piece is funny and inspired enough that you can't care too much. if voltaire were writing "candide" today, the character would be a self-help writer.

had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called "half empty." i usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest sequel, or prequel that hollywood throws at us. this was different and surprisingly ¬ñ so much more entertaining than anything hollywood spends millions advertising. when my husband and i go the movies, we go to be entertained ¬ñ and "half empty" did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it. it is a funny, human, and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity. i especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. it is almost like an operetta. that particular scene reminded me of a scene in "phantom of the opera" when 4 of the performers did not just, i.e., they sang against one another in a friendly retort. i am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film i have seen lately. it is silly, funny, entertaining and amusing. completely enjoyable ¬ñ which is what i expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like "half empty."

this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make for magic. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best, if i hadn't have known better, i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity.peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts....... only small actors, and everyone involved here should be patted on the back, taken out to dinner and be considered for an oscar.well done!

for anyone who has ever sought happiness, "half empty" is a must-see. this original cross- cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make "the producers" seem boringly staid. writer bob patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out, ending their relationship. when his book on happiness, "north star" finds zero success in the states, his publishers send him to germany for a book signing tour. while explaining their decision to bob, the boardroom erupts into a rousing song which would make monty python proud. from his arrival in hamburg, bob's complete ignorance of the german language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage. however, he soldiers on, impervious of his hosts true feelings towards him, until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction toward him.the original songs propel the film, often describing the subtext of the story in side-splitting precision. the cast, led by robert peters, exhibit an immaculately dry sense of humor and inhabit their characters as if they were not acting. see it for: a case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant; how merciless americans abroad are viewed; how little reason it takes to burst into song, and, above all, for a silly, entertaining, unconventional laugh.

everything is illuminated a young jewish american searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-european tour with some unlikely associates.liev schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. when successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- check. we usually get a mishmash of genres- check. but what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.elijah wood plays jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. he is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. the sepia picture bears his grandfather (an uncanny resemblance to him) and the woman. to aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a hip-hop loving break-dancer, alex (eugene hutz), his apathetic and perma-vexed grandfather (boris leskin) and his dog- sammy davis junior jr! what ensues is essentially a comedy. there is an un-patronisingly simple introduction with voice-overs. alex's is especially funny as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969, proving how popular he is with the chicks and break-dancing thus setting him up as jonathan's antithesis.schreiber begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves. all three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something schreiber was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is, the horrors that are allowed to crack through, i.e. the past are presented in an almost palatable tone (incidental music, cinematography) which make them all the more unsettling.as the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really are.elijah wood is as authentic as usual, bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen. formally a resident good in lord of the rings and a resident evil in sin city he plays jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth. boris leskin as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled. however, it is eugene hutz as alex that makes the show. the director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmicky.schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. the continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity, truth and family. if there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all. nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of world war 2 in a completely fresh fashion.-chi&ojo

i first saw this movie on an alaska airlines flight, and have since seen it twice more. it simply is -- and is simply -- one of the best films in years. i found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing, but a little cloudy on what had happened. after seeing it again a few weeks later, things began to fall into place. it wasn't confusing, just deep. in fact, the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time. for example, it occurred to me only after my third viewing that sammy davis jr jr (grandfather's dog) is more than just a pet -- perhaps she's the stand-in for his dead wife. witness how fiercely he protects her. there is symbolism galore, and none of it sappy or indulgent, just real. the adventure of their trip keeps the story-line in perpetual motion, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it really was the destination. as the movie continues, so does the adventure and i got the sense the destination was merely a way-point. the sound-track is fun, the scenery compelling -- and both decidedly eastern-block. i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film, but i'm not entirely sure i've discovered all the nuances yet. besides, it's more fun to tease these out yourself. as much as any film can be, "everything is illuminated" has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time. i highly recommend seeing it -- twice.

in america, the jewish jonathan safran foer (elijah wood) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. a few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called augustine in ukraine. jonathan contacts the odessa heritage tours, a family agency in ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find augustine, and together with the interpreter alex (eugene hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of jonathan's family."everything is illuminated" is a strange movie about a weird young man with the compulsive behavior of collecting souvenirs from his family to not forget them that seeks the past of his grandfather to understand how could be his life if his grandfather had not moved to usa. this bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional ukrainian family that owns an amateurish travel agency specialized in helping jews to find missing relatives, and together they have an almost surrealistic road-trip through the country of ukraine. the movie begins like a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "uma vida iluminada" ("an illuminated life")

spoilers a jewish frodo? yep, that'll be elijah wood again.ever since the concluding part of "lord of the rings", elijah wood as frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young jewish american, wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. now, with "everything is illuminated" he might finally have achieved this. playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character. still, it isn't like wood does this alone. aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer liev schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene hutz, wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "everything is illuminated" is a magnificent, moving piece of cinema.jonathan safran foer (wood), a young american jew, sets out to the ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america. arriving in the country, jonathan meets the all talking, all dancing alex (hutz) and his racist grandfather (boris leskin). travelling across the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existed.it's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter (it is actually divided into four overall). the first part, whilst occasionally a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part, to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step. it doesn't quite work, but as the film progresses, it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes.to the ultimate credit of everyone involved, as the story does continue, so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more. elijah wood is magnificent, boris leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him. most notable of all however is newcomer eugene hutz. playing an intensely troubled character, hutz is absolutely brilliant. he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character is communicating with wood, you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level. without hutz, the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent, but with him, it hits the next level.as a debut work for actor turned director liev schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to start. a work of passion (schreiber's grandfather himself an immigrant to america), he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content, and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots, he manages to really hit home. the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created, that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye. it is a moving story, and with schreiber's help, it becomes even more powerful.constructed with love from a passionate director, "everything is illuminated" is a beautiful piece. a road story with a difference, it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written. it's a film that everyone should see, and it is the perfect way for elijah wood to finally lay frodo to rest.

i really liked this movie ... but the ads i saw implied, and one published review actually said, that this movie "benefits from a light touch." that to me is very misleading.there is indeed plenty of humor: eccentric, un-subtle, sometimes somewhat twisted humor: the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed. but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. the movie weaves together themes of past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. the entire movie is suffused by the history of european anti-semiticism in general, and of the holocaust in particular.how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie? the review i saw suggested that the humor is absurdist. i don't think this is the case at all; at least not in the common sense. instead, i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish / yiddish literature and theatre. i don't claim to be any kind of expert in this area; but from what i've seen, humor is used, in this cultural context, both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people; and also humor is used as a means of "recovering the divine" for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism. see "fiddler on the roof" for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition.elijah wood (jonathon) wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look, well, strange: compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect. in this movie, it's easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth. eugene hutz (young alex) and boris lesking (old alex) are both really just wonderful. jonathon and young alex are from the same generation, yet seem so very, very different; and then find that they are not so different after all. and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of jonathon to that of young alex .. as a journey of intended discovery for jonathon becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex ... is to me so very moving.there are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from (i'm told) prague and environs, standing in for the ukraine of the story line. all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place; although i've never been myself to the ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience.all in all, if you're looking for light comedy, i would not recommend this movie at all. on the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delightful, and deeply moving film, please, check out this wonderful movie.

2005 was one of the best year for movies. we had so many wonderful movies, like batman begins, sin city, corpse bride, a history of violence.....coming up we also got brokeback mountain, king kong....but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. the first movie as a director of the talented liev schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of elijah wood's best roles. he is perfect as jonathan, a curious man that heads for ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii. liev schreiber, who also writes the movie, conducts a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (a lot of) funny quotes. this here is a genuine mixture of comedy with drama, bringing a movie that will be commented years from now. a serious oscar contender, everything is illuminated is a powerful, original, and, why not say, illuminated movie. but there's one thing you should remember while entering the movie: leave normal behind. this is special.------9/10

what an original piece of work. i've always enjoyed liev schreiber the "actor", but now one must appreciate the man on a multi-dimensional level . how did he get that field of sunflowers? was it computerize, it sure looked real. and how do you audition a dog knowing you are going to get that kind of performance? does the academy have a category for animals? i guess what i'm saying is that i really, really enjoyed this quirky, offbeat, little indie film. from the excellent cast (one would never know eugene hutz was not a pro actor) to the cinematographer (some beautiful shots) the music (bought the cd when exiting the theater) and of course the two "d's" (direction and the dog). all in all a "10"./

"everything is illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of the jonathan safran foer novel. this version is more about changes in eastern europe from world war ii through post-cold war and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory. debut director/adapter liev schreiber retains some of the humor and language clashes of the novel, mostly through the marvelous eugene hutz as the u.s.-beguiled ukrainian tour guide. he is so eye-catching that the film becomes more his odyssey into his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable milieu in sophisticated odessa to the heart of a cynical, isolated land that has been ravaged by conquerors through the communists and now capitalists, with both jews and non-jews as detritus. as funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura, we later feel his fish-out-of-waterness in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local yokels. shreiber uses elijah wood, as the american tourist, as an up tight cog in a visual panoply, as his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book. he and hutz play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot. once the grandfather's story takes over in the last quarter of the film, marvelously and unpredictably enacted by boris leskin, the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis, as they just tidy up the closure.schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document history. one of his consultants in the credits is professor yaffa eliach and her style of remembering pre-holocaust shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective.the czech republic stands in for the ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities, towns and countryside, as this is now primarily a road movie, and the long driving scenes do drag a bit. schreiber retains some of the symbolism from the book, particularly of the moon and river, but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those, they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate. as w.c. fields would have predicted, the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughs. in general, schreiber does go for more poignancy than the book. it is irresistibly touching, especially for those who haven't read the book, but less morally and emotionally messy.the film is enormously uplifted by its marvelous soundtrack, which ranges from songs and instrumentals from hutz's gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to paul cantelon's klezmer fusion score. this is not a holocaust film per se, being a kind of mirror image of "the train of life (train de vie)" as about memory of a time that is freighted with meaning now, but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that history.

actor turned director liev schreiber (the sum of all fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, everything is illuminated, by author jonathan safran foer. this tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.jonathan foer (elijah wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, safran, pass away. jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall. safran gives jonathan an old picture showing a young safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. thus jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the ukraine not knowing if she is still alive. he enlists the help of a brash, young tour guide named alex (eugene hutz) and his grandfather (boris leskin) to drive him to his goal. at first the trip hits dead ends and false leads, but as the group nears its target, the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town. there, they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn.this film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors. at times, the film is spoken in russian and seems like a foreign film. the title itself is a play on self discovery. this is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for alex and his grandfather as well. it's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime. by the end of the film, these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives. it proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul. it's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past. alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light. even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told.the story is deceptively simple. it functions as a road trip movie (like the straight story) combined with an interesting mystery story. it really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present. the ending is a bit surreal with its d√©j√† vu feeling.elijah wood (sin city, the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind)) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in the lord of the rings trilogy. here, he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show. eugene hutz and boris leskin fare better as alex and his grandfather respectively. even the grandfather's dog named sammy davis jr. jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion.the spare music score by paul cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. the editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly. the cinematography by matthew libatique (gothika, requiem for a dream) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath.the coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental. we never fully understand the whole background story of alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. likewise, jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man. at times, the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed. but these are minor criticisms of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure. that schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.

if anyone has any doubts about the talent of liev schrieber, just a look at his new film, "everything is illuminated", which clearly shows a man that is not only one of america's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. mr. schreiber has adapted the novel by jonathan safran foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. the film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.for those who haven't watched the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.jonathan is a collector. his love for his grandparents is boundless. he watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed. on a clear moment, this dying woman gives jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection. watching the photograph, taken a long time ago, a young couple are seen together. watching makes jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend, taken on happier times. watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors' past in the ukraine.jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency, heritage tours, of odessa for his trip to trochenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came from. the agency is handled by an older man, who claims to be blind, and his grandson, alex, a man who loves the pop american culture that has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. alex speaks a kind of english no one speaks and his conversation and translation, for jonathan's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard english terms. the old man insists in taking his dog, sammy davis jr., against the wishes of jonathan, who doesn't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip.as they embark in search of trochenbrod, it's clearly that his companions, especially the old man has no clue where he is going. at this point, the film becomes a road movie, as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another. as the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end, it indicates they have indeed come to the right place. some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past.the older woman, living in the isolated place, is the missing link of the story. she is able to put things into the right perspective. but here is where the story changes its emphasis from jonathan, who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. we watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself. this, in turn, changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected jonathan and his guides have been all the time.some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story, which after all, it's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken. it would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book. the great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what's about to be seen.elijah wood, a magnificent film actor, does an excellent work by underplaying jonathan. mr. wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character. the felicitous casting of eugene hutz as alex, the ukranian tour assistant and translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. mr. hutz is about the best thing in the film. his arcane usage of english gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer. boris leskin as alex's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as laryssa lauret, who is seen in the last part of the movie.the excellent cinematography of matthew libatique brings the splendor of the czech republic's countryside in all its magnificence. the musical score by paul cantelon is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie.above all, this is a triumph for liev schreiber, the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next.

this is precious. everything is illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. oh, how i've been waiting for this to arrive in austin. while elijah wood is charming as ever as jonathan safran foer (the real-life author of the novel everything is illuminated), it's eugene hutz (playing jonathan's ukrainian tour-guide and translator, alex) who truly steals this film. alex is a hip-hop-lovin' ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps jonathan find the woman who saved jonathan's grandfather's life during world war ii. the ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking. i'm thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former soviet state.the tone of the film, however, shifts when jonathan and alex do finally meet the woman they're looking for, and suddenly, this adorable comedy turns into a heart-breaking historical drama about a jewish village that was annihilated during the nazi occupation. everything is illuminated is about history, heritage, and the wisdom that can be gained from uncovering the past. it's perfect.

i just saw "everything is illuminated" at the telluride film festival. this is a truly remarkable film. very emotional, funny at times and heart-warming. bring your handkerchiefs! for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, i'm reminded of the endings of "babette's feast" and "the notebook." the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just as this film did.no spoilers here. the summary is, as imdb describes, a young man's journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up.the dialog is in english and ukrainian (and russian too, i believe). this allows for some wonderfully linguistically-based moments as one character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the english speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances.the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences. be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune.this is lieve schreiber's directorial debut and is well done. i give this film a 9, one of the best films i've seen in a long time. i recommend it highly.

in everything is illuminated, elijah wood plays jonathan foer, a jewish american who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during wwii. in a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.this is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. a stranger in a strange land so to speak. jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). but what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated. this movie will make you laugh and will make you cry. elijah wood is really good in this film, based on the novel by jonathan safran foer.from someone i talked to, this movie is somewhat different from the book. a book i gather is really good. nevertheless, this is a good movie, it has something for everyone and i really enjoyed it. can someone say oscar?

i walked into the movie theater, with no expectations for the film i was about to witness, "everything is illuminated". i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films. the directorial debut of actor, leiv schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake-dancing barely english-speaking punk from the eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust. this little movie brings out so many emotions, and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination, but also of relationships and connections. the acting is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of the cinematography, to die for. with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes "everything is illuminated" managed to capture my heart.

i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival.based on the novel by jonathan safran foer, everything is illuminated is the directorial debut of actor liev schreiber. schreiber also wrote the screenplay. in the movie, jonathan (elijah wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to retainers to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history. but the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare. all jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the nazis during the second world war. jonathan decides to undertake a quest to ukraine to find the woman, thank her, and learn more about his grandfather.his quest is aided there by a couple of characters who run a tourist company for jewish people, including a young man obsessed with western culture (eugene hutz), his grandfather (boris leskin), who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons of his own from the war, and his grandfather's temperamental seeing eye dog.the screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for jonathan's grandfather's town, driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past. the best performance probably comes from eugene hutz, playing alex jr., who starts the movie as a tracksuit-wearing, break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only jonathan, but all the characters gain their own illumination.liev schreiber, elijah wood, and eugene hutz attended the screening and did a very humorous q&a after the film: - schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a ukranian immigrant, and who died in 1993. this caused him to start to write to get his memories down on paper. meanwhile, he was asked to do a reading of foer's short story, the very rigid search, which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel. schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing, saying that foer had done in 15 pages what schreiber tried to do in 107. schreiber approached foer and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, movies, and the nature of short-term memory in america; in the end, foer agreed to let schreiber adapt the book.- schreiber's own project was intended to be a road movie, but the book has parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological history of the town of trochenbrod that spans 500 years; given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker, he said he'd leave that to milos forman and take the road trip instead. this imagined chronology was what moved him to make the movie in the first place, the idea that "a past lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past accurately recalled".- schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents. after searching unsuccessfully in ukraine for an actor, he was walking through the lower east side in new york, when he saw a poster of a woman centaur, topless from the waist up, with an insane cossack sitting astride her. under the poster said the name gogol bordello ukranian punk gypsy band.eugene hutz then took over the story. he had never pursued acting as music was his first passion. one day, a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music; screw sentences/syntax, language is my own.later, they got a call from a production company, looking for eastern european music that was medieval but modern. hutz met with schreiber, and he soon found the movie was based on the book he just happened to be reading. not long after that came up, schreiber asked hutz what he thought about alex and whether he could do the character by any chance.- foer and schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of september 11. both were in europe at the time and they talked about the derogatory comments they were hearing about americans, which led schreiber to want to try to find an articulate american who would defy the stereotype that europeans have of americans. someone who was awkward, vulnerable, flawed, innocent, and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country. schreiber started thinking about who that was, and elijah came up.one of schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is emir kusturica (i think that's who he said, who also directed a segment in another festival movie, all the invisible children) who said "you don't look for the actors, you look for the people." schreiber said there is something about who elijah is that he has a generosity of spirit and a sincere goodness as a human being, that came across on film. schreiber said that the eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer, and that if "eyes are the doors to the soul, elijah's are garage doors." - elijah wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character kevin in sin city and jonathan in this movie as both are sort of a blank slate on which emotions are projected. wood replied that jonathan may seem still and seemingly emotionless, but it is all about his observations, about his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in.- on the differences between directing and writing: schreiber said he likes writing a lot more and jokingly described directing as "hell". after his grandfather died, schreiber started to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself; is he content driven or not, or just good at interpreting other people's work? he said he loved the exercise of figuring out what is emotional to you, important to you.

"japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....major league baseball....but not to worry, "mr baseball" is there to try and change all that. but just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. the storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on. the japanese people are a gentle, respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society. all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable, funny film. it's definitely worth the watch!

you have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to japan as his career winds down. really well thought out and fascinating look at japanese customs and behavior. great supporting performances by selleck's manager ("japan's clint eastwood"), his girl friend takanashi, and his interpreter. the chemistry between selleck and takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball. look for haysbert as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill for allstate. movie wraps up very nicely. easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball.

this film got less attention than "league of their own," possibly because it has only one "name" star. but whereas women's professional baseball had only an eight year, midwestern town existence, japanese baseball is a vastly bigger entity, both in financial underwriting and popular support. that alone would make it the better movie."mr. baseball" shows the facts of life of japan-ball: the regimented cheering, the deference to umpires, the pressure of corporate owners on managers, the extreme conservatism of play - and no hot dog players welcome.it also touches upon the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an american jock, not the people most versed in foreign cultures - feels living in dai nippon. and the japanese, for their part, are not comfortable around foreigners and let it show in various ways ("the gai-jin strike zone," one american player complains, "bigger than a buick.")the script may not have won any awards, playing once again on the "redemption by improved play" theme, but i found it considerably more enjoyable to watch than the pokey "league." definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle on this great sport.

mr baseball was a fun video rental with my fianc√© susan nauss. susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie. ken takakura oda as a tough yet honorable manager makes sense. ken takakura has made so many wonderful asian movies, i correct the one reviewer and say takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like hotari. of course everyone likes tom selleck yet ken takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two. today someone accused me of being yakuza, well i say that my great uncle shadow president jack f kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our cocreators humans are free people fighting all the parts of adversity that president kennedy talked about in his inaugural address. to be honest someone has kept food prices very low in canada on things like bread. in honor of our cocreators please stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs. i hope that there will one day be a sequel to mr baseball with father ken takakura oda still as manager. thank you to imdb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind president george w bush and i support. support imdb.

i am very impressed by the reviews i've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. i couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that imdb members have already done. if i may, i'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: mr baseball was american and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was not an ugly american. the original ugly american was homer atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by burdick and lederer, and the exact opposite of mr baseball. homer was an archetypal american, and an archetypal engineer - he went to vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he met, he used appropriate, sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts, and he was liked and respected by them precisely because he exemplified democratic values and american virtues. his ugliness was purely facial, merely skin-deep; his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine.mr baseball exemplifies all the crass, ignorant, insecure boorishness that we europeans and americans so often inflict on other cultures; homer atkins, the ugly american, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and decency. i believe that the ugly americans still far outnumber the mr baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.

an egotistic major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in japan, he contends with a culture that is alien to him, an apparently humorless manager, an attractive japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurities. there is a certain subtle charm that flows through tom selleck's performances. there is humor, sometimes softly understated, as in this film, sometimes slapstick as in "folks!", but always there seems to be some higher purpose involved. throw in an individual full of self doubts who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while holding fast to "doing the right thing," and you end up with a film both funny as well as thought-provoking. the cast fits together like a championship team, and even if neither cast nor film win awards for their efforts, they will leave the viewers feeling good (and maybe that's the best results after all). you'll want to watch this film more than once, and each time, mr. baseball hits a home run.

i really enjoyed this movie... in my dvd collection of baseball movies... reminded me how great the sport truly is... whether it's here in america or japan.

i am an australian currently living in japan. i saw this movie on tv here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of western and japanese ideologies colliding. whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in japan. the only part i thought was too hollywood-y was when tom selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10

not too many people seem to know about this movie. which is too bad because i think it's pretty good. sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. i think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch i suppose) and ken takakura (from black rain) plays the chief (the coach of the japanese baseball team). there isn't too much to complain about. it's just a light, easy-going, happy comedy and i recommend it.

*minor spoilers* i just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. only little big league and major league can compete with this one in my mind. i would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! without being too specific, i would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. tom selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. his animosity towards playing overseas in japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the dragons. he must adjust to life in japan ("first you wash, then you bathe!") he eventually sees eye to eye with his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness, though in a much different environment than he ever imagined! so for any baseball fan, or anybody that wants to watch a good baseball movie, mr. baseball will not let you down!

this is an excellent, little known movie. tom selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the japanese 'clint eastwood'. i'd love to see if this movie has come out on dvd yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. hiroku (tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. it would be interesting to see more of japan in the film. the baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, i'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. i love loading the tape of this movie at least once a year. best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after tom gets beaned in the big game, and an intensely sensual scene of tom having a hot bath with hiroku. dennis haysbert also does a great job, it's good to see he's finally getting some recognition, not just in baseball movies(he was also in major league).

this has always been a favorite movie of mine. i've owned a vhs copy, and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection. i also happen to be a huge baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, i picked up a copy of robert whiting's excellent book "you gotta have wa", that profiles the ins and outs of japanese baseball, and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan. as i began to read yesterday, it made me think of this movie, because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book. the parallels are uncanny. the jack elliot character closely resembles bob horner, an aging mlb slugger whose best days were behind him. horner's teammate leon lee is also depicted in the character max "hammer" dubois, a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the japanese game, and helps keeps his teammate sane. the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as horner, from big fanfare signing, early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media, and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration, alienation from teammates, fans and media, and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the us. the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. speaking of love interests, i'm sure many viewers have come to this site (as i did) to look up the actress who played "hiroko" (the beautiful aya takanashi), and what other work she has done. it only lists this movie. it turns out, based on an article i read, that the brief love scene she has with tom selleck (a foreigner) in this movie (mild by our standards - basically they kiss while he's in the bath and she's wearing a towel) caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public (males in particular) that she has never been offered another role of any kind, in movies or television - essentially blackballed by the japanese movie industry. it's a real shame, as she is(was) quite a talented actress in this movie. if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did -- go find a copy of "you gotta have wa" by robert whiting. a good read and a great companion book to this movie.

many believe this movie is a baseball movie. such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. this movie is not a romantic comedy.this movie is about culture. an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. it's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success. the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement, and they meet in the middle.baseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures. many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think it's a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief. it's not---the culture clash is the gravamen of the movie. based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture, i think this movie did quite well in that it didn't overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayal.overall, i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about.

redo the oscars from 1992, and this film might get nominated, or even win. it was so good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in american and japanese time capsules. if you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then, this film will show you. as an american, you'll feel like you tagged along for an extended japanese vacation, and by the end of the film, you'll be a die-hard dragons fan, as you accept the injection of japanese tradition and culture into their baseball, much as we have done with our culture in our own game.jack elliot (tom selleck) is a slumping, aging detroit tigers' slugger who is traded to the dragons, perennial runners-up to the dynastic yomuri giants, japan's answer to the yankees. the giants are admired for their success, yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them, something which is rarely done. the dragons' manager recruits jack as the final piece of the pennant-winning puzzle, and we're left with what could have been gung ho on a baseball field, but instead was much more.the casting was outstanding: selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can carry a film as well as he did his television show, and the japanese cast was equally good, down to mr. takagi from die hard back as the image-conscious owner. the other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the manager's daughter), strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in japanese traditions, beyond what was forced on her. she is a proper and supportive girlfriend for jack. even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with jack for what he endures from her, and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to love.the baseball scenes are great, bolstered immensely by a pre-fame dennis haysbert as another american ex-patriate and jack's western mentor. the usual fish-out-of-water elements are there, and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with jack to fit into a country that doesn't speak our language, and doesn't practice our ways, yet copies everything we do, including our national pastime. one of the funnier scenes occurs when jack, clutching a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss, and it can't be used against you, and exercises that right very humorously. the plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end, but not too neatly, and nothing concludes unrealistically.to call this a comedy is misguided: it's a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. the plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film. the situations were amusing, but in their place against a far more serious, profound, and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films i've ever seen. the baseball cinematography rivals that of for love of the game, for realism.some say the film is about baseball, or about japan, but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace, and how people arrive at work from totally different origins, with different agendas, and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company, or the team.a truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters.

this particular title is very interesting. the whole movie was like watching a ninja rpg, which is really cool. three magical swords, three clans, a horrible demon, a political power, yotoden has it all. the animation is decent, but a little grainy, the story is top notch, and the fight scenes are real cool. one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters. they are pretty freaky. if you liked blood reign and ninja scroll, yotoden is the one to see.

in the realm of the senses is a beautifully filmed, well-written, and splendidly acted film. it tells the haunting story of a woman who kills her husband after falling in love with another man. the ghost of her husband continues to haunt her lond after his murder. this film is really good, anyone interested should definitely check it out.

this is a film by oshima, the director of the notorious "in the realm of the senses", a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. this film takes place initially in 1895 in japan and stars the very pretty keziko yoshiyuki as seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. that man, toyoji, comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her, though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. soon they are having an affair and plot to kill seki's husband, to be together forever. they do, and throw him down a well. however, they didn't count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting seki and others in the village! this film is visually very stunning, the use of shadows highlighting this tale of murder for passion. ms. yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is especially very good in her role. its sexual at times, but not like "in the realm of the senses". some of what ensues is up to our imagination. i found this film to have a consistency of mood that makes it very watchable. a little creepy but that goes with the territory. i'd recommend this.

empire of passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. it's like a riff on james m. cain's the postman always rings twice, at first: seki (kazuko yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo (takahiro tamura). but when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man toyoji (tatsuya fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for seki... and a little extra. they're soon sleeping together, but after he does something to her (let's just say a "shave"), he knows that he'll find out, and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo. they drink him up, strangle him, and then toss him down a well. naturally, this will come back to haunt them - but that it's literally, at least to them (at first super-terrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji), changes gears into the 'kaidan', a japanese ghost story.this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of "oh, ghost, ah", but out of the total dread that builds for the characters. in a way there's the mechanics of a film-noir at work throughout, if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town (i.e. the snooping cop, the "evidence" found possibly by another, word getting around, suspicions aroused, etc). it's compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start, manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared toyoji, and her reactions to gisaburo's re-appearances are staggering to her. take the one that comes closest to poetry: gisaburo's ghost, pale-blue face and mostly silent, chilling stare, motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw. she does, reluctantly, and he pushes her around on a road she doesn't know, in the wee hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric.while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end, there's so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work. after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses (which, ironically, got banned in his own country), he made something that, he claimed, was even *more* daring that 'senses'. maybe he was right; empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also starring tatsuya fuji, a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range), but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread. you can believe in ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would-be lovebirds will go. the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their very souls is at stake.and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly, it wouldn't surprise me if an american remake was already in the works) and crafts shot after gorgeous shot, with repetition working its way into the mis-en-scene (i.e. the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road, the camera at a dutch angle, the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this (i.e. toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion, or how seiko's nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). it's daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit- not to be confused with the spiritual, though there may be something with that as well- about life and death's connections to one another, inextricably. it's a classic waiting to be discovered.

a genuinely creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie just falls short of what it promises. it is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise. for most of the way, its imaginative and genuinely gripping, but at the end its almost like oshima just lost interest in it, and brought it to a rapid ending.the story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together. but their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness. its beautifully handled, with imaginative set scenes, and the lovers passion is portrayed beautifully. but too often the movie fails to really deliver on its promise, almost as if oshima loses his nerve in the same way the lovers do.its a worthwhile movie to watch just to see how oshima combines his great skill as a film maker with some exploitation movie tricks to pull the audience along, but sadly its not a true classic in the mold of movies like onibaba or woman of the dunes.

in 1895, in a small village in japan, the wife of the litter carrier gisaburo (takahiro tamura), seki (kazuko yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, toyiji (tatsuya fuji). toyiji becomes jealous of gisaburo and plots with seki to kill him. they strangle gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and seki tells the locals that gisaburo moved to tokyo to work. three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of gisaburo, and seki is haunted by his ghost. the situation becomes unbearable to seki and toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of gisaburo."ai no borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. the remorse and the guilty complex of seki make her see the ghost of her murdered husband, spoiling the perfect plot of her lover. the cinematography is jeopardized by the quality of the vhs released in brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, inclusive "ringu" and the american remake "the ring" use the view of the well from inside in the same angle. the performances and direction are excellent making "ai no borei" a great movie. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "o imp√©rio da paix√£o" ("the empire of passion")

eros and thanatos, love and death command the dialectics of life. by the end of 19th century in a remote japanese village a young man and a married woman, older than he, fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. but they never enjoy that freedom since remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. henceforth in an atmosphere where dream (nightmare) mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man. it also haunts the dreams of the other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and gossip around the couple which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer that comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband. but which makes this movie more interesting besides this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the couple's feelings in a shakespearean deep psychological and dramatic development of remorse, anguish and fear which turns their love relationship into a nightmare until their final doom. the expressionism so dear to japanese theatre or movie acting is also present in the players' performances but not in an exaggerated form. just only in the necessary measure to show more effectively the most deep feelings of the depicted characters. this is indeed a solid good movie.

if you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy, then this film comes highly recommended. kelsey grammer gives an excellent performance here.the film also gives you something to think about the next time a serious sub movie asks for 'silent running'....

my wife and i find this movie to be a wonderful pick-me-up when we need to have a good laugh - the conflict between some characters and the repore between others make this a sure fire comedy relief. i am so looking forward to this movie coming on dvd so i can replace my well watched vhs.

especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to dvd. i found this movie very funny. rip torn is classic with his barbs; rob schneider if hilariously annoying as the over-compensating ensign; bruce dern makes a great "villain". the entire cast seems to be having a blast, and it's not at the expense of the audience. if you like just plain fun comedy, and aren't looking too deeply into meaning, you just might fall in love with this one.

i found this movie to be a simple yet wonderful comedy. this movie is purely entertaining. i can watch it time and time again and still enjoy the dialog and chemistry between the characters. i truly hope for a dvd release!

this is one of my 3 favorite movies. i've been out on the water since i was 13, so i got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery (the movie, although taking place in and around virginia, was filmed around the san francisco bay), most notably the mothball fleet just east of the benicia bridge where kelsey grammar's character was first introduced to the uss stingray, and the piers of san francisco at the very end of the movie (including a boat that i've worked on). as other people have said, the actors appeared to have fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining. the line "we're approaching the bottom, sir! i can hear a couple of lobsters duking it out" is, at least to me, priceless.i am one of numerous people who is anxiously awaiting a letterboxed dvd of down periscope to be introduced.

i've lost count of the times i have seen this movie, but i love it and find it very funny each time i see it. the facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great. the characters, especially "nitro", "sonar" and "stepanik" are hilarious. i thought kelsey grammar, rip torn and bruce dern did a great job. in fact, i think this movie was perfectly cast. i think it does need to be released in dvd before i wear my vhs version out.

i can't explain it, but i find this movie not only funny, but so enjoyable i feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least i did when i had cable tv. i always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because i watched it on cable. i plan to get a dvd of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. i liked the plot and the idea of the movie and i especially liked the cast. i always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception. this film deserved a better fate than it received and kelsey grammar deserved at least one love scene with ms. holly. who wouldn't? the characters in this movie were the kind of guys i could identify with when i was in the military and the zaniness was exact. nice going troops.

as an ex (nuclear) submarine officer i must admit this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding hunt for red october). someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. ok - not realistic - but it is a comedy - and has all of the "inside jokes" from the submarine force. a great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the "orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. definitely "dbf" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. but they want ten lines in order to post this - jees is the admiral in charge here? line 10.

i've seen this movie at least 8 times, and i still laugh every time. the movie is about how an intelligent and motivated man, against all odds, can cheat the entire over-self-confident system.this movie is for all people, who like a funny movie.the action and comedy is well mixed into a brilliant film, that i hope to see on dvd soon.

you know sometimes you just gotta have it? that's how this movie is with me. i am almost embarrassed to admit that i like it, it is so goofy in some parts, but i find myself reaching for it when i'm down and just need a good laugh...and trust me, i am just not a "goofy movie" kinda guy.you can read the synopsis so i don't have to bore you with that, just rest assured, if you like kelsey grammer you will probably like this movie.one more thing, be sure to watch the end credits. you don't need to read them, just watch them and catch the performance of "in the navy" by the village people...and friends.

this film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. the misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.hilarity ensues.like the "police academy" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. i thought it was an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv. no, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes. plus, lauren holly looks hot in a naval uniform.

i really enjoyed this movie. i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. being an old navy guy, im still stirred by the rousing rendition of anchors away! i also love the "mchales navy" pirate atmosphere. i could have done without the female dive officer but im just old fashioned i guess. she was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. the cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. loved the salty old engineer and his first class po too. and grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer. i loved the "driving scene" as they passed the golf course on the way into port, lol. pure navy! and i swear i had an xo that was just like that little weasel... im am so glad this is out on dvd, about bloody time. :0)

the first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice!for me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel. i was born and raised in norfolk virginia and met my share of "different" sailors- i even married one! most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time i see them. groundhog day, bruce almighty and down periscope are still funny even after i know the dialog by heart. kelsey grammar with his "god i love this job!"was sincere, genuine and lovable. rob schneider is hysterical as the crew gets back at him for being annoying. i am still amazed at the size of that fishing boat next to a sub! i can see why folks who live this life would notice the uh-oh's but its not a documentary after all its a comedy and i just love it!

look, we rated this a 10 on entertainment value. it's a comedy sure, not an epic like lord of the rings, or gone with the wind. still for comedy, particularly these days, it's a 10.not a long movie, moves quickly and easily. kelsey grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub, pitted against the us nuclear navy in a war game, designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (kinda ironic this plot...pre 911) don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly laughs from start to finish.rob schneider is 2nd in command (like "frank burns") and pulls many laughs. all the others are perfect for their parts as well. rip torn and bruce dern.look plain and simple, you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude (their is some language and innuendo) then rent it, or buy it (we did) and enjoy! i wish they would make a part 2!

down periscope is not a "great movie". but then again very few flicks are. so if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a "great movie", without the capitals. no sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine. they are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. they must take on the entire us-navy with it's nuclear submarines. but they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome. but you root for those underdogs and this makes it a very entertaining movie. watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars that is)

it starts a little slow but give it a chance. in the spirit of the "wackiest ship in the arm" and the "pink sub" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. rob schneider is priceless as a lt that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and "pirate" crew makes him walk the plank. in contrast kelsey grammar(similar to cary grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. this movie is more about lines than plot. from the "beered up" fisherman in charleston harbor to the "whale" decoy, their antics took me by surprise and i laughed out loud.

i saw the movie in the theater at its release, then watched the vhs tape over the years, and while strolling through target saw this dvd bundled with "pushing tin" for the exorbitant sum of $5.50.there is something about this comedy that has really clicked with me - how kelsey grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel sub and a crew of screwballs and misfits. he's up against the navy's best - a los angeles class nuclear attack sub - and his old captain (wm macy).bruce dern plays the bad guy, rip torn the admiral running the exercise - if you don't laugh hysterically during the "run silent" segment with the cook, well, you have a different kind of humor from me.towards the end the machinist says "d.b.f." with no explanation - it is apparently some inside knowledge gotten from an old submariner consultant - thanks to google i learned that with the advent of the nuclear subs the old salts would wear "dbf" pins - diesel boats forever. a navy friend said that many of the technical aspects aren't correct but who cares - it is one of the funniest movies i've seen.i don't think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!

i just discovered this film and love it. just the right mix of fast moving story, entertaining characters, hilarious moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes), and fun performances by kelsey grammar, harry dean stanton, ron schneider, rip torn and more. buckman is especially good, and i really enjoyed watching the guy who played stapanick.i also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the pampanito, for the running on top scenes and emulated it almost exactly for their sets. the set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of the pampanito online and then compare it to scenes in the movie. they did an excellent job on this film.what a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie!

this is a very underrated movie to say the least. as has been pointed out in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script but you find yourself saying "who cares?" while shooting milk (or insert beverage of your choice here) through your nose. it was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync. while kelsey grammar is obviously a gifted actor (reference 'frasier', this movie) the supporting actors/actress play their roles quite well. i found in interesting how they threw in the part about duane martin blowing the shot in the 'big game' for navy's basketball team; if any of you is a basketball fan you'll remember martin from 'white men can't jump' and 'above the rim' and you'll know that martin had a short stint in the nba with the knicks. nice how they threw in believable character attributes such as this. rob schneider's anal-retentive character was the perfect offset to grammar's calm demeanor. lauren holly played the gutsy-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough to make you want her to succeed. this is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before...the comic bits in this movie definitely last. i still find myself laughing 12 years later."is that one of my chickens?" "uhhh...no. this a parrot....from the caribbean." "well don't let it fly away...that's supper." "arrrrr.....arr."

"down periscope" has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs. since then, we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now.it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile, alabama in 2002. a group of cub scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board.it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood... which is rare company.thanks to kelsey grammar, lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!

the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years. the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable. the comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a well-worn underdog plot. when you're sure you know the ending....surprise! highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular! great movie!

not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. kelsey grammar is wonderful in this movie. another funny guy is rob schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with ken hudson campbell who plays buckman. lauren holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as lt. lake. bruce dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. the actor i liked the most was toby huss as nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious.plot is a little uneven, about lt. commander tom dodge, who for years has wanted to command his own sub. when he finally gets the chance, instead of a brand new sub, he gets a rusty wwii diesel sub, the stingray. his crew isn't any better, misfits of the u.s. navy. he is then put in a series of war games, that shows how an old diesel engine can handle itself against the current nuclear navy. things still don't get any better when he finds out his dive officer is actually a female officer, to see how women do on actual subs. to get the commander position he wants, he has to win the war games, and blow up a dummy ship.the movie fairs quite well, in fact i laughed non-stop when i saw this movie in theaters. i loved when they were in silence and buckman farts, and everyones reaction to the smell is hilarious.overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is just plain fun to watch, it nice to have a movie like this, i hate movies that try to be 100% serious.

i love military comedies (sgt. bilko, stripes, in the army now, major payne) and down periscope is hilarious, but it has a heart as well.the stingray ss-161 (the uss pampanito) was gorgeous. absolutely beautiful, a piece of art come alive. so it was a diesel engine sub, so what? i learned that the aircraft carrier uss ranger (which stood in for the enterprise in star trek iv), a huge ship, was 'conventionally powered', which might mean that ranger was a diesel too.my favorite scene: pascal: jesus, buckman, this can's been on the stingray since korea! this can expired in 1966! buckman: (takes finger full and tastes it) what's the matter, sir? it still tastes like creamed corn.pascal: (yelling) except, it's deviled ham!! buckman: that would be a problem.it's story, perhaps a wee strained, seemed plausible. winslow respected dodge, and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give dodge a chance. he gave him a battered but still seaworthy balao-class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear navy and 'attack' charlston harbor, and norfolk. 2-star admiral graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping that they would screw up so dodge would lose. can tom dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team, and can he take an old, out of date sub, and beat the navy's best?

almost missed it. while visiting friends in philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, i was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. it wasn`t just bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. add to that a plot liken to the maltese falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as i`m concerned. about ten years later it appeared on tv and i taped it. >

it was a sweet, intro for the most intelegent sailor soldier, sailor mercury. it consisted with a new "in croud", merciurios. he, at the beganing wrote a love letter to ami, which would be starltling (of course) and, now, ami thiks he is a chibi-einstien, and he is attractive (he ended up looking like umino (melvin)). this was a halarios (expesialy minako's "it's no skin off my neck" scene (hot!)) well, i really like the bishojo senshi sailor moon series, i personally think its the best anime ever!, but, this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurios as sailor moon r- it was more like the "s" movie. i saw this @ sailor moon univewrse, with real player, and it was pretty good. (over all)

well i don't know much about anything, but i sure liked this film. in short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. in other words, it was everything it set out to be.the story is set around a girl's first love, (as the title suggests) and i certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. i mean, it is a children's cartoon. it's really just a simple story, but it's told well, and it holds your attention well.in the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.

this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust, this is near perfect cinema. rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy, and riverbed chaos! see this movie if you have to kill to do it!!! you will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with "cat from outer space" coming in as a not so close second. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense logging! gotta love disney, for all moral failures!

a lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. to young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. nicknamed "good time charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first. his wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. this film is among those wonderful disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. these films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact. unlike disney's animated talking animals the animals in these films remained true to their own nature. they also make great travel films for seeing the western states.

this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years. it came on the disney channel in the wee hours of the morning. i stayed up to watch it, and found it even more entertaining than the first time. the story, the scenery and the characters are as good as they come. i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film, they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time. it's very memorable in more ways than one. i would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned.s

this is the australian tv series. it is a classic. the stories and actors are excellent. who can forget picker and his gramophone or chet being ambushed? this is cult tv. the australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in the outsiders. what can i say timeless adventure. the music and song just fantastic. the closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that. all 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the australian myth and i think this is what this series has.it does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas, i think that is the key to the series and why it is so good.

yeah great cult tv series. great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class a candidate for dvd release. this is a seminal tour de force of australian tv history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with doug parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its antipodean glory. this is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty down under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur. come on abc! get with the program and release this cool 70's cult baby for all to enjoy - or re-enjoy if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time.

contains spoilersthis is a peter watkins film. if one has seen his bbc masterpieces "cullodden" and "the war game", one will recognize the style (and his voice) within seconds after the start. made in 1971 it is set in a very near future, when the vietnam war has escalated even more and now seems to involve china. nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with violently using drumhead tribunals (outwardly civilian with 'everyday citizens' as judges). because "prison building can't keep up", an alternative is introduced: the punishment park. delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment, in this case a 85 km trip through the californian desert at 100¬∞f. if they reach an american flag at the end without being caught by national guard or riot police, they will be set free, or else they have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we will see). the film is made in a completely documentary style with three european teams covering a tribunal and the course of two groups already sentenced. scenes jump between the tribunal tent, the hunting troops and the hunted condemned. watkin's scarce off commentary gives us raw background information (time, temperature etc.). the tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over 'undesirables' to clearly innocents (e.g. a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies). the defense lawyer (who does take his job seriously) has to take abuse from both sides. what makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the rhetoric of todays administration to the detail. meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the 'rules of the game' don't really apply. the question remains open, whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome (i suspect, it is both). at the end we are back at square one with the next group going to "punishment park". this description may indicate a heavily biased (or even demagogic) propaganda movie but that would be misleading. the behavior (all participants were nonprofessionals as usual with watkins) looks and sounds real (the tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials). i'd say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problem. with watkins's "the forgotten faces" the reaction was "we can't send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore (because this is indistinguishable from the real thing)". with "punishment park" it ought to be the same. effectively banned in the us as far as i know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance (especially today).

punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema. shot in the southerncalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, watkinscreates a film like no other. he follows two groups of prisoners (onepre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. after they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of eitherserving out a prison sentence or they can participate in punishmentpark (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but theclothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local lawenforcement officers who use the park as a live action trainingground). i can't say enough about this movie. sometimes it feels as ifyou're watching a real documentary. this is one of peter watkins mostaccessible films. i advise you to look out for it. you wont regret it!highly recommendeda+

my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold london evening in leicester square, after the movie, says: if they didn't speak english and they didn't show the stadium, you could have thought this was the slums of a south american city or some other slum anywhere in the world,not queens in nyc.ramin bahrani is , right now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the other face of american, but the real face of america.ramin bahrani's movies are like ladri di biciclette, or germania anno zero, or roma citta' aperta. chop shop is reality turned into a movie, is more realistic than a documentary, in fact i think ramin bahrani's movies are more realistic than documentaries. this is a great movies, but don't expect any car chase or shooting. this movie is about tragic lives on the margin of the wealthiest , richest country in the world.

where do i begin? let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the dvd -- my wife and i watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. i can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. it's worth hearing.i'm not a southern boy, but i spent some time around memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. this film almost smells of the south, it's so real. samuel jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, is magnificent as the emotionally bent lazarus, and christina ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as rae, a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life. i've always liked ms. ricci's work, but in this performance she's giving 137% of herself every second she's on the screen. awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film. there are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so i'm just commenting on the work. i'd heard the name justin timberlake before seeing "bsm," but had no idea what he looked like, or even why he's famous. bumping my head on 60 years old, i'm outside his target demographic, to say the least. after seeing this film i will recognize him. he can act! he gives a substantial, believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut. the director is from memphis, and shows reverence for his home region. he is also a fine story teller......and i must mention the music. i love blues, and the soundtrack for black snake moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan. i'm writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure. see this film, and i mean now.

better than i expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. the music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning ricci into a trailer trash betty paige and it works. samuel l. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing. even justin timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. i get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.

i opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone...samuel l. jackson. i happen to like him, a lot. i had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film, so went into it with no real expectations.jackson didn't disappoint as lazarus, a down-on-his-luck blues man in the deep south, and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes. but the real surprise here was christina ricci, at best a vapid airhead in real life, who took the role of the sexually-abused town tramp rae and made her a believable, almost even likable character. watching the decidedly non-sexual relationship evolve between lazarus and rae was simply amazing.justin timberlake, pop star turned wanna-be actor, should go back to causing "wardrobe malfunctions" and prancing around a pop stage. his mostly forced performance was distracting, at best, from the real story here.this movie is raw, gritty, and at times quite "in your face". not everyone will like it. those that do, however, will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list.

initially i was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the dvd. in fact, this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image(s) it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me (or to my friends). but, i rented and watched it and was truly amazed.i agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences, so it is definitely not something i'd want young children to watch (and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway).i enjoy movies like this whereby the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no-nonsense, direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad. the acting done ... was it acting? ricci and jackson performed so well, i was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting. same thing with the story ... may seem far-fetched somewhat, but it was done so very, very well. it reminded me of another movie with mel gibson, tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so were well-defined.i found much depth in this movie with the character's involved, so feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be commended on a perfect fit/result. after viewing this movie, i had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like i did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and watched it. they, too, were quite surprised at how good it was. it is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off. i can see now how the art applies, but i'd not heard of this movie before, and the art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys dvd sales/rentals.these characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the "feel" for each. i felt i could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. so, with the jacket art aside, i would recommend watching this movie.

the trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between lazarus and rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. however, at it's core, black snake moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along. maybe it's just me though, but i think poor lazarus should've had his story focused on more. he's a hurting man after his wife leaves him, but we never fully see how helping rae resolve her past pains heals him too. it's just implied that it does--in essence, he plays the wizard that helps the young rae overcome her curse, through a big ol' chain and some blues.i like the story, but i wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational. the side characters were fairly decent, if simple and i liked the music. the acting was good enough, although i can't be certain if the rae character is fully believable. but that might just be my naivety.all in all, i liked the film, but i wasn't compelled by it. maybe it's that i'm too critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so, while it all seemed very cool, i could never truly buy it. the chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. still, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues. 7/10

black snake moan is uproarious. it is over-flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. in continuation of hustle & flow, brewer paints his portrait of the american south almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient greece epic. and yet as far high above us his movies hover, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is.as in traditional fairy-tales, brewer paints his portrait in black snake moan using extremes and exaggerations. sharp and stark character traits, when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film. but brewer doesn't begin his film with "once upon a time"; in this film and also in hustle & flow, brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark, gothic fable of sex, prostitution, and ultimately, redemption. these themes run through the film's veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, brooding setting.but despite these harsh extremes, brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well-executed, three-dimensional characterizations in lazarus and rae, particularly emphasized with their relationships with lazerus' friend at the pharmacy, angela, and rae's mother.the acting is, all-around, quite perfect. one gets the feeling that both christina ricci and samuel l. jackson were born to play these roles. their characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters. and they succeed admirably. samuel l. jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before. with films like pulp fiction, jackie brown, shaft, and others, he has crafted for himself a typecast of the "ultimate bad-ass". in black snake moan jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he's done before. and frankly, it's just fantastic. what comes as quite a surprise, though, is the casting of justin timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable. sure he doesn't have much screen time, but like what brewer did with ludicrous in hustle & flow, he actually gets timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do, and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating.but what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere brewer creates. the rural southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crusty, rugged kind of texture to the entire film, which more than fits in with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. and by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when rae gets her itch, or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as lazarus plays his "black snake moan" blues number for rae, brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to the rural southern setting. and it works so utterly fantastically to craft brewer's unique vision.and one can't talk about a craig brewer film without mentioning the music. in hustle & flow, he utilized a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. in this film, the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere. it is a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. and it sounds just absolutely fantastic.in all, it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, god-fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may have not been very much to write home about. but this film is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are crafted in the film regardless. no, this film is about the vision ¬ñ and what a unique vision it is! it is about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. it is about anger, fear, redemption, and most importantly, the blues. and it's all wrapped up in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up-and-coming directors list, and with such a solid follow-up to a great debut film, hustle & flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects.it also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles i've heard yet.

as i was reading through the comments, i was surprised to come across one that said this movie was "not very profound." i have to disagree¬óthis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films i've ever seen. yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. however, i also praise the heart of the movie. it resonates with deep meaning and feeling¬óit is a story of redemption. it is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die. it is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. it reminded me strongly of the book redeeming love by francine rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you may just see yourself in these characters. sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty, but they are real.

then you will be a big fan of this movie. its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. i'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, i had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but i am a big fan of samuel l. jackson and i enjoyed hustle & flow so i thought i would give it a chance.i'm very glad that i did. it turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. the story had heart, and was very influential.the music in this movie also added a nice touch. craig brewer mixed his style from hustle & flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the blues. his musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. he also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.no doubt, if you liked hustle & flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. i give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.go out and rent this movie.

i must admit, i didn't expect this to be as good as it was. i also didn't expect samuel l. jackson to play slide and sing blue either.cinemark of beaver county pa does this frequently. they advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited about seeing it, and then disappoint you by not showing it...i expected that with such a great cast of jackson and ricci and even a former n'syncer (timberlake), that this movie would at least have shown for a week. but nay, at that time if i remember correctly mi3 was showing on 3 screens (that or some other type of supposed blockbuster).like blues brothers, and crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about. passion, and hard times. religion and sex. hell hounds of the past. redemption. i mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work.this was just a good all around story. of course, not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders. but it does have samuel l. jackson...think of what happens to jacksons character from pulp fiction after he walks the earth and settles down and that essentially describes him to a "t".great and underrated, but aren't all the good ones like that anyway?

this is the best comedy period. it is so underrated! clever witty humor, great casting! jerry stiller is the jewel in the show, he is so incredibly funny and quirky, simply a comical genius! doug and carrie have great chemistry! i so do not see what the hype is about when it comes to everybody loves raymond it is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and just not the witty show, i can't remember laughing in more than 1 episode. king of queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs which is normally caused by arthur spooner, i think its about time this comedy gets the hype it deserves and not the lame raymond & co.

this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv. i own all 9 seasons on dvd and literally could watch them over and over. anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining, and laugh out loud hysterical, is crazy! kevin james is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. my boyfriend and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston (where we live) and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary valentine (danny) once. they are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work. there are so many comedians out there that are just awful and kevin and gary really show the true side of real comedy. leah remini, although a snob and bitch in real life (so i have read) is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms. she truly makes the show...along with jerry stiller! this show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes!

this show is brilliantly hilarious! i started watching in 2007, and had never heard of it before then. after one episode, i was hooked. i'm never home to watch it, so my wife bought me the entire series on dvd. non stop laughs, need i say more? i wish it was still on tv, because it is definitely worthy and a whole lot better of crap on currently on tv.i wish they would make a movie, seriously, who wouldn't go see it. kevin james's name alone will bring a huge fanbase to any movie, the guy is (make your stomach hurt) funny.just a really good, down to earth, believable show. if you have the chance to buy it on dvd, do it, its worth it.

as over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), king of queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. it's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in manhattan in queens, ny. with them lives carrie's father arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic jerry stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears. other important people are their best friends deacon and kelly, a married couple, and their other friend spence who's almost 30 and still lives with his mother. what makes this show so unique and funny is, above all, that every single character seems so real and carrie's cynical, sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of doug's good-natured, slightly dumb optimism.and arthur's the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits. he often gets himself into trouble and doug and carrie have to drag him out of the mud. even if in my opinion the quality of the show decreased a little within the last years it's still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. it takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them, but after that's done, you get some unstoppable laughs from it. although i think i couldn't survive one day with arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him, i really adore him in this show. watch and have fun, i give it a 9 out of 10.

i think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after seinfeld,after elr and after friends. those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.koqs came at the end of this special time in tv. but don't let that dissuade you.king of queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. i never laughed so hard than i did at seinfeld. but koqs comes real close.when it comes to laughing, i have to rate koqs second only to seinfeld. elr has to be second though as the character creation and interaction is more endearing.either way, koqs is top ten of the last 20 years.the only other sitcom worth mentioning now is two and a half men which really doesn't hold a candle to the other four but is all we have left.

i'm not really a t.v. watcher - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and "general hospital" still had luke and laura - but there are a few exceptions and i definitely think that "king of queens" is one of them. every decade has it's classics and i think that this show will (or damn-well should) be amongst this decade's best. its comedic timing is awesome and can, at times, be down right odd. on a more 'serious' note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle - and not so subtle :)- complexities in their characters without getting too hokey. one commenter wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and i agree; it's definitely one that kind of grows on you but once you're in, you're pretty much hooked. and with good reason!

i guess my husband and i are a little slow. we don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. in this case, we didn't start watching koqs until almost the 6th season. i'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. other than the fact that we are not big fans of "appointment" tv viewing. our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a dvr yet). so i guess it wasn't until tbs starting running reruns on their daily lineup in the evenings that we started watching consistently.by the time we got hooked, there were only a couple more season's left before the series was canceled. but we still watch it almost daily on tbs. i almost prefer to see series this way, because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week.but the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories don't carry over from week to week. but that is fine with me, because you can watch an episode, then miss weeks - and still pick back up.my only criticism is the writing wasn't always consistent. some episodes would be outrageously hilarious, and then some would only be mildly funny. so, i'm not sure it had the quality of writers that seinfeld or raymond had. but i loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic. kevin james is just plain funny to look at! so even if the plot isn't that great, james body language and expressions make the show worth watching. leah remini is great as the "play-it-straight" wife. i think its harder to play the straight character for laughs, than the comedic character, and she does a great job. she has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else. she is one tough cookie! and who can forget arthur as carrie's dad, who lives with them in their basement. this a great series and i was sorry when it cancelled. but a big thanks to tbs for keeping the king alive in reruns!

i recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. some episodes are silly -- doug is upset about some trivial/juvenile thing and acts stupid etc.still, others are quite amusing, and sometimes touching. these include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters. for instance, the "juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife" theme is found in several sitcoms. (carrie also has something about her, looks-wise. not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) but, carrie has an edge -- she might be nice on the eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father.and, she readily admits to it -- for instance, one episode revolves at her lack of desire to be nice to co-workers. i personally find her b*ness sexy, but you have to be the right sort of person to be able to live with that. amiable doug is a good match. and, deep down, see likes the simple things too. maybe, not as much as doug whose nirvana is watching tv and eating a big snack next to his big screen t.v., but no culture gal she. this lack of an overally sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children. of course, the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either, and adds to the charm of the show. they live an ordinary working class sort of life in queens -- it is realistic in that sense. and, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax. it gets a little tired at the end, so it's probably good it is ending. it had a good run. see also, becker.

i need help identifying an episode of king of queens. it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone, and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with "i love you." however, it's hard to do and he ends up calling her back, only to close with "i love you." it's a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time.i think (but i'm sure) that's it's the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at carrie to perk her spirits up.i saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. don't know what network i saw it on. can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?

this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger, and i really remember liking it. however, i didn't have great taste back then (not to say that i do now) so i can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. the movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so i gave it an extra point. yeah, worth watching. i know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash. the song is "play a love song" by the jaguars and it is very hard to find and obtain. in fact, this movie is, too. i can't find it anywhere online or on dvd or on vhs. i'd like to see it again so i can gauge if it was actually a good movie. oh well.

this movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it.when susie q is of to her big night at prom she dies in a fatal car crash on her way to prom by kids who are drunk and high.as the years go by susie's house gets sold and a family moves into the house that she loves.as the boy who now lives in the house sees susie and is the only one who can.the two team together with his little little sister and try to save susie's parents from being broke.staring amy jo johnson as susie q.this movie will fell your heart with comedy,sadness and laughter.i hope that you see this movie because it is very good.but no one seems to have it on dvd or vh's and it no longer comes on tv.

i love this movie. and disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. i think they should definitely put susie q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where i can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. online, or anywhere. i told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. all these disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring. i need susie q back!! it was a great movie and had great actors and i don't see why it was taken off the air. if everyone loves this movie so much why was it taken off the air. please take my comment into consideration and along with all of the other comments made to this movie. thank you, have a nice day.

i'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. all who love this movie should email disney and increase the demand for it. they'd eventually have to sell it then. i'd buy copies for everybody i know. everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and i haven't figured out why disney hasn't put this movie on dvd or on vhs in rental stores. at least i haven't seen any copies. this is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. the kids in the new generation don't get to see it and i think they should. it should at least be put back on the channel. this movie doesn't deserve a cheap download. it deserves the real thing. i'm emailing them now. this movie will be on dvd.

does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. i have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the dvd or vhs or idk.i saw this right off disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie. if anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and willing to sell it to me for like 50 bucks or something, please call 201-566-0148. thank you

i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see susie q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded. i miss this movie, wish upon a star, kazaam with shaquille o'neil, and a bunch more. where did all the good movies go? i want them back.i miss all the good movies and they don't have them anymore. if anybody finds out if susie q or any good old disney movie comes out will you please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl(no blank space)148. thank you and i hope you want this movie back too. have a great day

my kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that amy jo johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with. (as you can tell i am rambling a bit to fill lines lol). but seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching. disney please give us a dvd or replay!

don't you ever miss the good old days when disney actually made great movies that really moved you? growing up with disney i always found myself being captivated by the characters. every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. i remember friday nights and running to turn on the tv just to watch their newest movies. susie q was one of my all time favorites. i never forgot this movie. even till this day when one mentions the song "susie q" i always remember the movie. if anyone is thinking of watching this movie i promise you, you will fall in love with it. i don't think i will ever be able to forget it. you will not regret watching it. unfortunately it's sad to see disney movies such as "the hannah montana movie" come out. what ever happened to disney?

susie q is an original and isn't like those other bad disney film, ***spoiler*** a boy named zach moves to a new town and has trouble at school, he is good basketball. a girl in the 1950's died with her boyfriend, when their car was crashed off a bridge. susie (amy jo johnson) from the power rangers - pink ranger- is helping zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the way he must explain to his sister about her ghost, and finally getting this necklace, susie returns to the bridge she died on and then she gets in the ghostly car of her boyfriend and they float up. later as he misses her he finds a girl who looks just like her. (do you believe in reincarnation?)susie q is a good movie to see now and then but they barely give because disney needs to fill everything up with stupid movies and shows i give it a7/10

susie q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. it's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. at first, i thought the movie would be the clich√© cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was i wrong. it made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. i loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!! i recommend it highly to anyone, and the movie is family oriented, so you won't have to worry about unsuitable content. truly, if disney would show more movies that are up to par as susie q., it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world. now if only disney would show it just one more time!^_^ go susie q.!!

although not the most technically advanced film i have seen, this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them, and feel something when susie q. has to go, but feel good again when she returns as maggie.lots of stock dialogue, and a contrived plot-line, but most of all, lots of fun.

this is the best movie i have ever seen and i love it very much is is so sad and loving i could watch this movie over and over again. when i first seen it on disney channel i was like i would love to see this movie again. i would love to watch this movie everyday and i recommend it to anyone. this is really a good movie. to anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it they better go and see it because it is really good. i love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from then on i was just all into this movie. if i could watch two movies everyday it would be this one and beloved those are my two favorite movies i really love them

i love this disney movie! its a real cute movie, and when it comes on again, i will have to make a mental note to tape it. i really like how they break into the bank trying to find susie's parents information. you should really see this movie. its great for the whole family.

i forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to barcelona and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time.the movie was enjoyable. it's of course always a pleasure to see audrey tatou.however, i have a very strong issue with part of the movie. the lesbian roommate tells xavier that women like to be physically dominated (which i take issue with) and shows him some sort of butt-grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman. xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend - who starts out saying "no no" "i'm married, i'm married" but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab?? all of a sudden she's moaning "yes yes" and they're going at it on the benches in parc guell. i found this really really offensive. furthermore it is very stereotyped. how often have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but obviously doesn't mean it? no means no. grabbing butts/physical domination isn't going to make it right. it just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths.i wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand "suck it, slut" (or something like that). did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go?this section really ruined the movie for me.

so we saw this on dvd at our apartment here in paris. we're all here on an exchange program. we all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! i mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clich√©d but still true, know what i'm saying.i think i related more to the quiet guy (the italian) than xavier because i'm more of the observer in our group. anyway, i wish i had a hot roommate like cecile de france. she seems like a cool chick in the movie and for real, after i saw her hosting the cannes festival last month.now i'm thinking i wanna go to barcelona next summer after seeing this movie. i gotta check out the sequel too which just came out here in france.

a rather charming depiction of european union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. central to the story is xavier ( romain duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in france, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. he learns about life and love rapidly. duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. the rest of the cast also play well. occasionally they all lapse into english when they want to make sure they are communicating,uncertain about all their apartment mates' ability to understand french or danish or whatever the languages may be. cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers.

this movies is really special ! it's about a young french who go in barcelona (spain) in order to study and in barcleona he meets other youngs europeean like him. this film he's the european movies of the year so go watch it !

a young frenchman uproots himself as he becomes an erasmus exchange student in barcelona and comes back a better man. sounds boring? no way! the movie is filled with colourful people, all of them stereotypes (the british twat and her racist brother, the sexually liberated dane, the ultra-organised german,...). in this case though, the stereotypes are brilliantly done. you feel like you know people like that (i for one know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they're just like the characters in the film!), they feel like real people! go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles!

i liked this film very much, as i liked before the other movies by cedric klapish. all the actors, coming from all over europe, are very good and funny. one can really feel the influence of "amelie", like in many other recent movies, but it's ok.

surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an erasmus program. the beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though i don't agree with the notion that when you do erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. but that's just me. the movie is deep, and at the same time very light. cool and recommendable.

this movie deals with the european erasmus exchange program but more generally about the european youth. it is so true , that i don't know klapisch did to reach such a masterpiece... definitely one of my top 5 movies. it reminds me of the famous song "this is my life, my life, life is life..." 10/10

as a former erasmus student i enjoyed this film very much. it was so realistic and funny. it really picked up the spirit that exists among erasmus students. i hope, many other students will follow this experience, too. however, i wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience. but at least one of my friends who has never gone on erasmus also enjoyed it very much. i give it 9 out of 10.

l'auberge espagnole is full of energy, and it's honest, realistic, and refreshing. not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in barcelona for one year. beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack. if you're older, this movie should bring back a flood of good memories. if you're young, learn by this example.

my favorite film this year. great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. set in barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. the leading role would never have been cast in hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. the characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. there were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired. the film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. i nearly didn't watch it, but did just to see audrey tautou. her role although billed second or third was minor, and was outshined by several other characters. i wish more films like this were made. it brought to mind the big chill or the breakfast club. don't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1/2 way through.

i got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say "french culture". i thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played wendy's brother. also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.favorite part: when william is making fun of the german guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) my french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. watch it!

my wife and i watched this marvelous movie this evening because we will watch russian dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before the second.we both loved the spaniah apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives-now in st. pertersburg, russia. we both identified slightly with the rough framework of the story because we were students, florence italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to our early lives. our living was considerably different but as with this movie, anytime you throw together young people passing through the same life-hoops as any developed world people they will experience much the same life situations. the collection of people and the personal difficulties that they faced were universals and therein lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that i will see tomorrow. as i wrote, the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile. this must be one of the film's great strengths-allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and yet remain aloof. the viewer can, through that distance, chuckle to themselves thinking, "i wouldn't have done something that dumb" or "i would have avoided that trap". maybe that's why we go to movies.

i love this film (dont know why it is called pot luck in england - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name!), i spent 8 months in barcelona, not as an erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. it brings back so many great memories of the fun i had with all the friends i made from different countries, and of the city itself. i really want to see the followup 'les poupees russes ' (the russian dolls), i'm guessing it wont be released here? my brother saw it in france and said it def wasn't as good, but had a lot of the same cast (the brother of wendy gets married apparently). anyone know anything about this film? and whether it may be released?

xavier,a french student moves into an apartment in barcelona with a cast of six other characters from all over europe. an italian, a danish, a german, a british, a spanish and a belgium.he wants to get a job in eu with the help of his father's friend. he says there are jobs here a lot, but if you know spanish and spanish market. so, he advice him to go spain. xavier gets an eramus grand and fly to barcelona by living his girlfriend and mother.he first learns that the house he will stay is no longer available and the small rooms in barcelona are even more expensive than he thinks. he stays in a french couples house while he was looking for a house. he has been interviewed with the 5 people from the house and has been accepted. he had an affair with this french guys lovely wife and totally messed up everything with his problematic girlfriend.do you want to hear more? did you travel abroad for education? watch this movie, i promise that you will have a very nice time.

**spoilers ahead**it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. i thought this was full of (silly) clich√©s andthat it basically tried to hard. to the (american) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? to the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? to the french: would you really ask about someonebeing "√† la fac" when you know they don't speak french? wouldn'tyou use a more common word like "universit√©"? i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understandeurope (and i love it), but my (german) roommate and i found thispretty insulting overall. it looked like a movie funded by theeuropean parliament, and it tried too hard basically. it had allsorts of differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing initself) but the result is at best awkward, but in fact ridiculous--toomany clashes that wouldn't really happen. then the end of themovie--the last 10 minutes--ruined all the rest. why doesn't xaviertalk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris? why doeshe just walk off? why does he just run away from his job, is that"freedom"? and in the end, is the new europe supposed to rest ona bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day? is this whatit's made up of? besides, the acting was pretty horrible. i can't believe judithgodr√®che's role and acting. why was she made to look likeemanuelle b√©art so much? at first i thought xavier was ok butwith retrospect i think he was pretty bad. and that's all really too bad, because technically (opening credits,scenes when he's asking what papers he needs) it was reallygood (except for sound editing around the british siblings), and thesoundtrack was great too. so the form was good, but the contentpretty horrible.

cedric klapisch's movie l'auberge espagnole is easy, breezy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger years and attractive youths. at its core, it's the feature-length presentation of the long-running mtv reality soap opera known as "the real world" in which, as its motto goes: "this is the 'true story' of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped... so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real." this is exactly what happens -- minus the cameras planted at every minuscule corner of the house in barcelona, spain, where xavier (romain duris) comes to stay, having to learn spanish to fill into his job's requirements. an outsider in many ways, he slowly forms a camaraderie with his house-mates who come from all corners of europe except america... this is a movie in which the only american shown is an unlikable character with whom wendy (the adorable kelly reilly) is having an affair with ("only for sex," she confesses, since she has her own boyfriend who makes a late but dazed appearance.). throughout his stay there, he tries to maintain a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend played by audrey tautou while he begins a tentative flirtation with the wife of the owner of the spanish house where he is staying at and gets some advice from a lesbian house-mate (cecile de france) as to how to seduce a woman. a sweet little feature that presents a moment in time that twenty-somethings will never see again, l'auberge espagnole is forgettable fun containing within itself the threshold into the "real world" experienced through xavier's eyes.

as a european, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. klapisch (the director) went to the new york film school from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.it is interesting how the film balances the message that "one should not generalize" with the notion that "for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth". for example, the italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known italian stereotype. the german character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes. but the most stereotypical aspect about the movie is not a character but the central theme of infidelity. as a critic observed, infidelity is as crucial to french film as class is to british film.both the main character and his girlfriend are played as not entirely likable, which i think is deliberate and great.it may be unintentional, but some of the nationals have elements that could be taken as a metaphor for their countries' perceived role in the eu. the british woman has a fling with an american (who is an entertainer - like a 1980's us president) while the frenchman shows himself as the natural leader (when the landlord shows up).although europe is not as diverse as new york, it is striking that we see only two non-white characters. one is a chilean woman with indigenous features, who despite appearing the age of our main character is not portrayed as a potential object of interest. another is a gambian-spanish or rather gambian-catalan male who appears a bit invented.one might ask why klapisch chose protagonists who were all from long-established eu member countries in western europe. while these nationalities reflect what he and i would meet as students in the 1980's, i believe exchange programs in contemporary europe are much more diverse. the erasmus program encompasses some 30 countries from iceland to eastern europe, many of which are not eu members. i do understand, however, that the choice of nationalities that are more familiar to the majority of the viewership may have been deemed necessary not to distract from the contrast klapisch wants to create between the peoples' europe and the bureaucratic europe.despite minor gripes a great movie that made me consider going back to europe to live. a french friend of mine, also an expatriate in the us, captured our shared feelings in this piece of contradiction "if europe was more like the us, i would leave in a heartbeat".

clich√©-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. when you hear a vague outline of the story ¬ñ erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in barcelona ¬ñ you predict a collection of euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. pas du tout! in fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young frenchman, xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. there are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant french neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the english girl, xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure. so what does xavier learn about relationships? nothing positive. in place of a conventionally happy ending, there is a regrettably portentous finale about `identity' ¬ñ xavier has ¬ëbecome' all the friends he made. nevertheless, this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success. i saw it in luxembourg with a mixed euro-audience, who enjoyed themselves hugely and even applauded at the end.

the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because i'd missed lots with all the laughing i did). i'm european and i've studied abroad and i've as good as lived with spanish, french, italian and german people. the film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews i see that it did p*** people off. but, this film gets the stereotypes so right i cannot fault it. except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal. the english guy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. drunk, annoying, insulting but shines through in the end. as well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct. at first he's shy, doesn't know anybody, misses home, doesn't know his way around. as time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave, it is extremely difficult. a feeling people can only understand if they've experienced it. i highly recommend this film.

"l'auberge espagnole" collected the audience wherever it was shown. it gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. and it is not strange. we have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. and it is wise by the way. "l'auberge espagnole" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. but most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the european union.the main character of the film is a french student of economy xavier. for his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to barcelona. in spain it turns out that the lectures are being given in catalonian language. that probably doesn't help the increasement of knowledge. but it helps in tightening the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students. especially if they rent a big flat together. there are 3 girls: english, belgian and spanish, as well as three boys: german, danish and italian. our french guy will also get there. a year is a very long time. long enough to get close and make friends. and get to know some european stereotypes while trying to break them apart.klapisch treats this special case of a process of uniting europe with humor and without pecky didactism. he comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same. they like jokes. they like to make irresponsible relationships. but they don't neglect their aspirations. the most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community. they live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality. they are full of unusual ideas for life. young europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own. they are europe's hope to fight the many problems of the union. for example, the terrifying administration system. in the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences. but they also now how to live the full of life. and they won't allow taking that full of life away from them.

this film is about xavier, an erasmus exchange student from paris who spends one year in barcelona. during that time, under the influence of all the new impressions, he changes and grows. upon return, he has a much clearer view on his life and finally takes it into his own hands.this is one of the most moving films i've ever seen, and the reason is probably that i've been in a very similar situation. i'm from germany, not from france, and for me it was madrid, not barcelona, but i can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an erasmus semester in spain will do to you. from what i hear the story is autobiographic, and that's probably why it is so realistic.let me give some examples (mild spoiler alert) - xavier shares a flat with other students from italy, denmark, germany, belgium, spain, and england. the flat looks exactly like all the erasmus shared flats i've seen in madrid. the main characters are nicely developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. the spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - the story of xavier and his girlfriend martine, who remained in paris, is also very typical. about 90% of all relationships break up during an erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - there's a wonderful scene in which xavier tries to convince wendy, his flatmate from england who is kind of "uncool", to go out with all the others. he finally succeeds, and wendy probably has the night of her life.another great thing in this film is that it's truly trilingual: the students in the flat speak spanish or english, and xavier speaks french with his mother and girlfriend. there are subtitles so that everyone can understand what's being said. i surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere.i can imagine that for non-erasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy, but for all my fellow erasmus i can only say: this is your film! if you haven't seen it, do so. but be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia...10/10

one of the biggest french success of the year 2002, "l'auberge espagnole" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a french film. it is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. this movie made by one of the most interesting french film-makers of these last years, c√©dric klapisch, presents students coming from all over europe and gathered all together under the same roof in barcelona. these students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor. i guess that if the movie worked so well, it is because a lot of students must have recognized themselves in the main characters' portraits and especially xavier's.we follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an erasmus student through his eyes. xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his faults. an intelligent making with quite a lot of ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety about the world and being an erasmus student. on that subject, the best examples can be found in two sequences. the first one is when xavier asks a woman at university for the papers he has to send to prepare his dea. when the same woman informs him about the different necessary procedures, all the papers appear on the screen when she is naming them! in the next sequence, xavier's voice-over confides to the spectator his vision of the modern world. now, where to find the second example? well, the scene where xavier has a thorough medical examination during which klapisch films his visions is widely sufficient to speak of itself.moreover, the director wasn't really interested by his main character's studies. he left this point low-key. he rather put a lot of effort into xavier's private life, of course, in his love affair with anne sophie but also and especially in his relations with his fellow tenants. it is a real friendship story that klapisch shows us with its moments of happiness but also its arguments and its tensions. through xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay, he will have been initiated into life which will make him more mature. the message that the author wanted to transmit isn't difficult to guess. you naively believe that you live in an untidy and complicated world. you mustn't give up but intensively search to get what you want even if it is difficult.apart from this, we could also fear that with the topic, c√©dric klapisch wouldn't avoid a trap: the clich√©s. let's be frank about it: they are included in the screenplay but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie. then, the screenplay contains convenient and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding we see xavier shedding a tear after he left his family. but fortunately the shortcomings of the script stop here. quite funny dialogs and cool young actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole.in spite of its weaknesses, "l'auberge espagnole" is to be taken for a success in the movie of young people. besides, the whole atmosphere it brings out lets us think that this movie is directed primarily to a young audience. ultimately, the end of the movie and its big success let us suggest that klapisch succumbed to a fashion that goes right for american cinema: the elaboration of sequels. and indeed, the film-maker currently works on a sequel entitled "les poup√©es russes". let's hope that it will be as good as "l'auberge espagnole".

in france, xavier (romain duris) is a young economist of twenty and something years, trying to get a job in a governmental department through a friend of his father. he is advised to have a specialization in spanish economy and language to get a good position. he decides to apply in an european exchange program called "erasmus" and move to barcelona to improve his knowledges in spanish culture and language. she leaves his girlfriend martine (audry tautou), promising to keep a close contact with her, and once in barcelona, he is temporarily lodged by a french doctor jean-michel (xavier de guillebon) and his young and lonely wife anne-sophie (judith godr√®che) he had met in the airport. later, he moves to an apartment with international students: the english wendy (kelly reilly), the spanish soledad (cristina brondo), the italian alessandro (f√©d√©rico d'anna), the danish lars (christian pagh) and the german tobias (barnaby metschurat). then the belgium isabelle (c√©cile de france) and wendy's brother william (kevin bishop) join the group, and xavier learns spanish language, and finds friendship and love in his experience living abroad. "l' auberge espagnole" is one of those movies the viewer becomes sad when it ends. the story is a delightful and funny tale of friendship and love, in a globalized world and an unified europe. this very charming movie made me feel good and happy, although i have never experienced to live in a republic of students. the newcomer william provokes the funniest situations along the story, with his big mouth and short brain. further, it great to see a fresh approach of students living together different from those dumb american fraternities and their stereotypes, common in american movies. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "albergue espanhol" (spanish auberge")

there are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. he falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently. when wendy's brother (wendy is one of the room mates) comes from england the film starts to become a lot funnier. well anyway, xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and will change his life forever. overall a very nice nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. i thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries, all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun. i gave it a 9 out of 10 because i left the theatre with a smile on my face and thinking about things i haven't done yet while i'm still in college and would want to do before it's too late.

this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their "erasmus year" in barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location. the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. there are some clich√©s about the countries but most of them are true! the characters could not better represent their different countries.having experienced "erasmus" on myself during my exchang semester in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic. i had many experiences which were similar to the characters (except i didn't get laid as often). the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college movies.finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work life.9/10 (i may not be very objective though)

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! i enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. this is what the scifi lovers want. excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver ! ok the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films.. films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these aren't sci fi films.. sci fi produces excellent films like sabretooth , alien hunters etc .. well done .. keep them churning out!

i shot this movie. i am very proud of the film. it was a great experience which shows up on the screen. halfdan hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. the sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. john york and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story. i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances. i disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good. watch it and decide for yourself.

i'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because i really liked this film. if you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring ben idiot affleck or some other hollywood loser. it's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. however, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed. people who like euro flicks will like this one. adam sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely not their style.

this movie makes you think. it shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. i think that women might think about this behavior, but i don't think they act on it. the dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. i was relieved when the prisoners escaped. i was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not. maybe that is more realistic. life seems to run in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed running up hill.

ok, first, to all the haters: get a life! i don't see why you even bother to post on these boards, when obviously you know nothing about cinema, robots, or people. this movie has an important lessons for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships, and destiny. really, we are all robots, programmed to respond certain ways to certain stimuli without thinking. how many times have we seen a sunset and made some trite comment without even thinking about it? i say, thank you aqua (brilliantly played by bernadette peters) for making me stop and think about the awesome power of mother nature. it's only when val and aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire--to find love, and to flee the factory in search of a creative life. this movie should be mandatory viewing in prisons--just think of the dreams and hopes it could inspire in the inmates. maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a crime-free world.we can all learn a lot from these robots. i am a better person for heartbeeps.

a beautiful reflection of life's desperation and misdirection of finding love. tragic, while at the same time, absurdly entertaining. most people do not give this film a chance- ignorance- just a mere reflection in itself. until next time...

okay, where to begin. did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team shields and arnez? bet ya didn't. but they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. then they faded off into obscurity. now, this movie has everything. a crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty harry. lots of cool robots. it's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. it's the first robot romantic comedy. now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues. but there are very minor and can be overlooked. i think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over again. 9 stars.

best robot romantic comedy ever, using the robots as the romantic characters, which leaves short circuit out of this category. this was andy kaufman's best effort. bernadette peters shows her versatility here with an amazing performance. while not a great movie in many areas, i'll award it a 9 on guts and quirkiness.

the film had no help at all, promotion-wise: if there was an advertising promo on tv or radio, i didn't see/hear it. the only newspaper ad i saw was on it's opening weekend: a dingy, sludgy b & w head-shot photo of andy as val-com, behind jail bars, with headline: "wanted! runaway robot!" ( which was also the poster in front of the 3 movie theaters i saw it at --not the nice little color poster on this site, with headshots of all the cast, and cartoon of crimebuster --which really wasn't that good--they ought to have used an action scene from the film itself--didn't they have an onset photographer? a poster is supposed to help a prospective audience decide if they want to see the movie--there were so many people who couldn't get into their sold-out choice, and wanted to know what heartbeeps was about--and that poster didn't help! that dingy pic, and the only other photos supplied to papers were so indistinguishable in b & w that they were worthless. ) there was no trailer for the film: only a slide at one theater, consisting of the word "heartbeeps" inside a heart-shape, with a cupid's arrow through it, and one that was a totally black picture: just andy and bernadette's voices saying "val-com! my pleasure center is malfunctioning!" "so is mine; do you think we ought to tell our owners?" that is no help to people who hadn't been aware of the movie.during the filming, andy told reporters that he couldn't eat, once his plastic lips were applied, so he would "load up on breakfast, and fast" during the day's shoot. i don't know what bernadette did: but at the time, i'd wondered why they didn't just sip protein drinks through long straws, or eat astronaut-style pur√©ed food via tubes? phil-co, the baby robot, seemed to have been the pre-curser to short circuit's johnny-five, with the same eyes, similar face. i've been trying to find if they had the same designer, but no help. i have vintage magazine articles about the film, and the design team was immensely proud of their work, and were going for a special award for their innovative device to create stenchless "smoke" for catskill's cigars. just shortly thereafter, lucasfilm did not use that device, though they ought to have, for return of the jedi's scenes with jabba the hut: a man created "steam" around jabba, by blowing cigar smoke into a tube, joking that all he needed was a glass of brandy, and he'd be a happy man. i thought that lucasfilm's using of real tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by smoke. john williams, who had then recently succeeded the late, great arthur fielder as the maestro of the boston pops ( which was then a ratings hit--but it never recovered from fielder's death, and is now a shadow of it's former glory ), was using the show to promote films with which he supplied the music. he'd premiered "the empire strikes back" score there; and you would think he'd have helped heartbeeps along, by playing a few numbers there? the one thing that critics had liked of this film was williams' score--yet it was not available for purchase! i saw one vinyl album, in 1982, with half heartbeeps, half another film--but it disappeared. i only just tonight saw the cd listed on this site, and have ordered it. if i can ever get a scanner, and time to type out the articles, i'd like to create a heartbeeps tribute site. i liked the movie, and don't care what dissenters say! the only trouble with the film, was, that near the end, it was messed up, logic-wise: the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own fate, make their own choices; yet, when the junkyard owners tell them that phil needs to go to the factory, to have a "purpose" programmed into him, they don't even question it; they just glance meaningfully at each other, and they go. along the way, each of the adults lose battery power, and "die." they aren't really dead, as they are robots, and only need new batteries, yet it is treated as "death," with little phil crying over them, and rolling away. so, what was the point of this? phil never gets back to the factory, and gets "a purpose!" and of course, the junkyard owners could've driven them, or given them all battery recharges, with back-up batteries; but the real point was to have this poignant scene, where the robots all wore down, and phil is left to cry. at the end, val-com is a golf instructor, and aqua-com is --i'm not sure what. catskill is an entertainer--what else is he supposed to be? i'm not sure that they made it clear. the junkyard owners seem to be taking it easy, lying on chaise lounges, drinking lemonade from phil, their "bartender." val's and aqua's new "daughter," philsia--i think the name is--maybe it's sylvania--doesn't seem to be much more than a table lamp. there is missing footage, which is sad--from photos i surmise that the stuff missing includes a sweet scene, where phil is having a christmas, with val gifting him with a car's steering wheel; aqua is supplying a horn; catskill has taken the firefighter helmet to give to phil, as we saw; and they have christmas trees. i don't know if any missing footage supplies better logic, or if the writers just couldn't think of a better crisis/resolution. the film was trimmed to 72-75 minutes, to pair it with other failing films. no other reason than that. for a dvd, i would love to be in on creating, as i want to see interviews with the cast/crew and john williams, and the merv griffin interview. the making-of footage; and reediting and restoring the missing footage to make it better.

and that's saying a lot. rent this if you want to be staggered by oddness, blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts, direction, and casting in the history of films. i'm staggered. i can't believe i watched it. i'm a big bernadette peters fan, normally- but this tested my resolve. don't read any more reviews here, it's best if you know nothing about the plot. just rent it. you won't believe what you're seeing.......

this film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive. the indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes. one major difference for this film, "only the valiant", is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline, but at the same time, deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all, even if they don't accept that charge.gregory peck embodies the tight-lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory. the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort; they, in turn, have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn't taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. eventually, the captain and the small band confront the hostiles, and at the same time, each confronts his own flaw. the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond, gig young, neville brand, lon chaney, jr., and warner anderson. a sleeper of a film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.

"nurse betty" is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commericial. it's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature "dumb and dumber" what with temporarily insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her.the fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams. the best part about "nurse betty" is it's unpredictability. director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.

after a summer full of retreads and disappointments, nurse betty is a breath of fresh air. the film is like no other i have ever seen. director neil labute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant in the company of men, and the almost brillant your friends and neighbors). renee zellweger gives the best performance of her career as betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (labute mainstay aaron eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world. morgan freeman and chris rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial. the trick to the film is that freeman and zellweger are really parallel characters. while zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite dr. dave ravell on a soap opera, freeman idealizes betty. nurse betty is a brillant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. my grade: 10/10.

nurse betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. it was funny, but it also had many touching moments. zellwegger, freeman, rock, kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. the story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. if you're sick of the recent formula movies, see nurse betty for something completely different. go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!

this movie just might make you cooooo. the film was well worth the dark trip to town. betty (renee zellweger)is the lone "acceptable" soap groupie out there. her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. i might even allow myself to get lost in bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that dr. ravell's real name is george... and speak of the devil; "looker" greg kinnear fills his role very well. while charlie (morgan freeman) makes you wish for his wish to come true, wesley (chris rock) makes you want to tie him to a chair. and rosa(tia texada)takes you back to those luminous grade-school friendships. the sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and loose his name. the remainder of the cast fits well. never one to do the same movie twice, nurse betty is the exception. one of these long, cold, needing to smile about something winter days.

flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best american films i have seen this year. neil labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while ren√©e zellweger and morgan freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. chris rock, greg kinnear aaron eckhart, crispin glover and allison janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. the greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.

a question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: who are the crazy people?the answer become less clear as the film goes on.renee zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked betty. in fact, she is so effective i almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.this is the first time ms zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.chris rock ¬ñ though as foul-mouthed as usual ¬ñ is fairly subdued as wesley. he is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed most.there are some interesting allusions: the first time you see betty she is dressed almost exactly like dorothy gale from the `wizard of oz' ¬ñ then later in the film she is compared to dorothy when she says she has never been out of kansas before. at one point the song that doris day was best known for, ¬ëque sera sera' is on the soundtrack and then later charlie (morgan freeman) describes her as having ¬ëa whole doris day thing going on.'this is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast.it has a surprising ending that, as contrary as it sounds, is actually fairly predictable.if for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice: morgan freeman.

goof: factual errorwhen charlie walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a silencer. after a few seconds we hear a loud bang from the same gun being fired.

i've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. it impressed me so much that i kept on smiling the whole day after i watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when i took the movie as the final taste of the festival. what i knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that ren√©e zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. but what i saw was much more than that! splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock √†nd ren√©e zellweger. a strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. and for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track. many soap-opera-lovers will love 'nurse betty' - the movie as well as the character!!! - but they can bring all there non-soap friends, 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scenes, the thriller-aspects and for the beautiful pictures. and i'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm!!!

nurse betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. in the same way i loathed fargo on first viewing, then realized i was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, i liked nurse betty a lot more the day after i saw it. hard to understand, harder to explain. as others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.fair job by greg kinnear, great work from morgan freeman (although i worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain). chris rock was good but not a standout. rene z. is so natural it's unnerving -- i.e., unnerving to be "natural" playing someone not well in the head. also liked the sort of "abrasive sparkle" performance from allison janney in a small part.don't go expecting as much of a "road movie" as you might assume from some synopses. (there is "road," but it's only barely relevant.) rated 8/10.

i have just seen a very original film that i would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' however, i guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `nurse betty.' renee zellweger stars as betty. she is a kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera. because of this, she goes on a journey to los angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover dr. rubell. to add fuel to the fire, she is also being chased by some ruthless `one life not to live' hitmen who think she has stolen their drugs. you could say that is how nurse betty spends `the days of her life' throughout the movie. this very `ungeneral' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital' set of her beloved soap opera. however, the only problem is that betty thinks this is all real. it is like her mind is in `another world.' ok! enough! i will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. i have already registered my vote for renee as a best actress oscar nominee. also, greg kinnear's performance as dr. rubell was as good as it gets in his acting biography. to sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `nurse betty.' ***** excellent

well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. this movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. but they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. i just about threw up, but i guess that's just me. greg kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. he has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. his scenes with betty seem like something out of "sleepless in seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. you almost forget that morgan freeman and chris rock are searching betty down. morgan freeman's fascination with betty was rather creepy, considering that he could practically be her grandfather, but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs! chris rock's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his moments. renee zellweger is so sweet as betty, the lovable waitress with the crude, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. it's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go along with it! her roommate, rosa, shines as well, as a woman who cares about betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with betty's sickness. and, lastly, there is crispin glover. as a fan of his, i, naturally, thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more. no one else has the same style of acting that crispin has, and the argument between chris rock, crispin, and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious. i guess i'm saying that i liked this movie quite a bit! if you can stomach blood, violence, and a lot of foul language, it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs!

*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* i found the film amusing.it was weird and i enjoy it,i laughed a lot so the bottom line is that i recommend the film.however i have problems with what labute wanted to say.the plot is very simple.betty(renee zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her "true love" for a soap series character,dr. david ravell (greg kinnear). simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film. and here comes the big question.what is the film all about? the reference to "the wizard of oz" is obvious.betty and dorothy are both from kansas however while dorothy come at the end of that film to the conclusion that "there is no place like home", betty doesn't come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we are left wonder what has she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing.it seems not to affect her at all.than is the film about the different between reality and fantasy? could be,but the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places.(and by the way "the truman show" dealt with this subject in a much better way).the film could be about obsession.betty is obsessed with the soap series and charlie(morgan freeman) is obsessed with betty.labute show two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession,in any form is dangerous,and should be condemned.he seems to have sympathy to betty's obsession because he sees it as a harmless one.all a long the film we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole film,but are left for us to think about without that they will have impact on the characters.the ending is simply a make -up that has nothing to do with what we saw before.it's a shame because the film could have been sharper if he would have concentrate in one or two subjects.as it is,it's about a lot but actually say nothing.what we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little film,amusing and weird that could have been much much more.

renee zellweger absolutely shines as nurse betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.when soap opera obsessed waitress betty sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (morgan freeman and chris rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on a reason to love are real. she decides to travel to los angeles to find famed heart specialist dr. david ravell (a character on the show).as the two oddly paired hitmen, the caustic rock and the pontificating freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and greg kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. renee zellweger turns in an innocent, candy-coated, and sometimes terribly sweet performance as nurse betty. she exudes goodness, warmth, and is irresistible. while the script sometimes feels like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations, zellweger is so likeable and so utterly disarming that it all comes together.with just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance from zellweger, a great supporting cast and a competent script, nurse betty is utterly delightful.7 out of 10

this is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while. an eerie abandon house, interesting characters, gore and a twisted plot. who could ask for anything more in a horror movie? it is pretty predictable for the most part but then again most horrors you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so i won't hold that against it. the music, camera angles and so forth are excellent. the sets are well make and very convincing. there was pretty much no subplots however, it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow... to be scared... this one keeps it pretty simple and does just that. if i were to compare it to any other movie i would say it reminded me of the remake of texas chainsaw massacre. definitely a horror movie lover must see.

having read all of the comments on this film i am still amazed at fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in dvd. yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, but it was the 2nd film by fox made in real cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. i saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things egyptian, culminating in my visiting egypt 4 years ago! amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh? in high school i read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip. now, true this film was made in the "old school" style, meaning that egyptians were portrayed by pink skinned and blue-eyed brits. however, has anyone seen the current hbo series "rome"? everything old is olde again. one can't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors mincing around as mayfair aristocrats in roman drag. not one actor on rome could pass for an ancient italian. that being said, the amarna period in egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. this film is immensely appealing ( to borrow a word from nefer) for its historical information (beer! brain surgery! iron!) and its gorgeous cinematography and score. i have a dreadful taiwan dvd version which i watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available. for anyone else interested in this subject i highly recommend the historical novel "a god against the gods" by the author of advise and consent. if anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact fox to urge them on, please let me know!

having been interested in akhenaton for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e-bay and bought a copy on dvd for 99p. i enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character sinuhe makes it more of a "family saga" rather than an action film. the costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). the back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. my main interest was in the character of akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. in this film he was portrayed as being "jesus" like in his refusal to go to war with the hittites even through they were invading egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power. initially one makes a connection between sinuhe, who was cast adrift in the river nile in a reed basket, and the old testament moses. but this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a moses like character carries akhenaton's monotheistic religion out to the wider world, if such a film will ever be politically possible to make. it is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between sinuhe and merit, the character played by jean simmons is hard to accept. and that sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so smitten by nefer the babylonian "femme fatal" to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and tomb is not really believable, neither that his parents would even have a tomb. in real life nefer (nefertitti) was the wife of akhenaton. and although horemheb did become pharaoh it was after a few others including tutankhamen , who was the son of akhenaton.but of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. maybe following "the de vinci code" book and film this film be re-made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! i wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject.

as a dedicated lover of all things egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, land of the pharaohs". the sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so "neat" in the production quality. i thought victor mature was well cast and peter ustinov a real gem! the whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (i have yet to see the 1999 movie "the mummy but am sure i will love it!).top stuff!

i first saw this movie around 1968 and if i don't see it once or twice a year, i'm surprised. i've always found it engrossing, well acted, and, for hollywood, surprisingly accurate historically. i heartily give it 10 stars and recommend it highly!

maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the mika waltari novel, or a fondness for things egyptian (i grew up loving to visit the mummies in boston's museum of fine arts) but i think maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. the production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, i'm sure). purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of sinuhe's character. victor mature is, well, victor mature. peter ustinov is a delight to watch in this type of role, which he always did so well and so wittily. bella darvi's performance as nefer is classically camp, and i find even michael wilding's rather dry portrayal of akenaten to have its own appeal.the historical oddity of akenaten's monotheism, a brief detour in ancient egypt's theological history, is interesting, as is akenaten himself, and well worth reading about; the religious wars portrayed here have a basis in fact.an interesting footnote regarding darvi, whose birth name was bayla wegier: she was a polish emigre who producer darryl zanuck and his wife violet took under their wing (i believe they may even have adopted her). her screen name darvi is formed from zannuck's and his wife's first names. she continued her acting career in france, but never achieved great success and, after a rather unhappy life, died at her own hand in 1971.altogether this is an interesting film and enjoyable to watch for the visual values alone. american movie classics shows this occasionally in letterbox, which is essential to capturing the scope and sweep of the story.

it happens often, while growing up, a hollywood movie impresses a youth. it not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled "the egyptian." audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. this is the story of a young egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. with such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions. the boy sinuhe, (sin-oh-way) which means, 'he that is alone'(edmund purdom) grows to manhood and continues asking why, even as he graduates from the school of life to become a physician. during his formative years he acquires a lifelong friend named kaptah brilliantly played by (peter ustinov), and horemheb (victor mature) who raises from a simple officer of the guard to commander of the armies. his life offers everything from a quick rise in social status to condemned criminal, to outcast, a wondering healer, and eventually to a station in life he never expected. fine acting goes to jean simmons as merit, michael wilding as akhnaton, bella darvi as the temptress, nefer, and john carradine as a memorable grave robber. tommy rettig, plays thoth, the son of the egyptian. in his final years, 'he that is alone,' finally discovers the answer he had been seeking all his life, which he bequeathes to his son, now in the care of his lifelong friend. excellent film! ****

i would like to submit the following goof.during the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. some of the soldiers approach captain willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. they have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. the use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water. this is probably a very good indication that it is empty,otherwise it would sink.

it carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of martin sheen and dennis hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding colonel kurtz.(i don't say marlon brando because after watching the documentary, "hearts of darkness," i am skeptical as to how much credit brando is due for that quality). the tone of voice i'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: "everybody gets what he wants. i wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. they sent it up with room service." it is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. a good example of is hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by t.s. eliot and rudyard kipling into his stony monologues: "i mean, the man's a genius¬ósometimes he'll walk right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say "did you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'¬Öif you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs" and then "i mean he's a wise man, he's a great man; i should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas" (the first one's kipling, the second one's eliot.

you can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of "judgement"); that layer is completely uninteresting.or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.you can try to view this as a 'realistic' vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.where i found the value was in the superb self-reference. coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character. the studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.so coppola makes a movie all about brando's greatness. to hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor's power. and he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. oh, yes: "the horror..." other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before "private ryan"; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.

i have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. and it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. i mean you just have to love robert duval , marlon brando , martin sheen and lauerence fishburne in this movie but specially duval. i can not believe that kramer vs. kramer did win an oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. so this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( the godfather ) and the best of hollywood actors you can only succeed. now i just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. this movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! i love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just so touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! the vietnam war was far from human and i believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. this is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. a movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate. how insane the world is and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. a must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!

this movie is a must see for any war movie buff. one of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:kilgore: if i say its safe to surf this beach captain, then its safe to surf this beach!kilgore: smell that? you smell that? lance: what? kilgore: napalm, son. nothing in the world smells like that. kilgore: i love the smell of napalm in the morning. you know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. when it was all over, i walked up. we didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. the smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. smelled like... victory. someday this war's gonna end...

most of these reviews are dead on, so i'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions i've seen on here.while the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. here in the usa, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.i'm sorry not to have seen more by sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused. anicee had a healthy career, who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late 2006. she was a beautiful and talented actress.vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazon.com occasionally, but usually for a significant price; i've seen it as low as $60 or so and as high as $152 (as of this comment, there were two for that price). the sequel video paul & michelle is not quite as pricey and can be obtained (when available) on amazon for between $16 and $70 on average.

i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name "algo mas que amigos" and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvd....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't released to the u.s market. best of luck..oh for more info here is one place to look.... http://www.zonadvd.com i think it going for 10 dollars usd on ebay as well.

i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film. it was when i was a teenager, i think (i'm 37 now). i started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. seeing other comments, i had no idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. i don't think i've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.but half a lifetime later, i still remember much of the movie that i watched late at night so long ago. i think the innocence of the charactors, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long term imprint for reasons i don't quite understand. maybe it is because i was a teenager at the time i saw it, and it touched me somehow..... i really don't know! i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened. oh, the agony!!i've not seen it before, or since, but i would love to. i keep a casual look out for it, but i now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. but i'd proberbly miss it in the tv guide even if it did show up. pssttt!!!reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. if anyone knows of its availability in australia, by all means email me and let me know.oh, and sean bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here. i've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a james bond film. what are you up to these day? oh, and do you have a copy of the film? cheers!!!

it's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - apocalypse now, now a re-cut, re-up, redux 22 years after it's original release.the film is loosely based on conrad's heart of darkness, it's main plot (if it has one) being capt. willard's journey on a naval boat through the vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue colonel. (colonel kurtz) we see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the colonel's story along the way.my initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times, especially early on, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic col. kilgore. as the film progresses however, a good deal of tension is built up with willard's reading through various reports on col. kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.the usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and i found the performances of martin sheen, marlon brando, robert duvall and frederic forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. the score i found initially sounded out of place, but as the film progressed... i'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better, or it fitted better, or if it had just grown on me, but by the end of the film i was thoroughly enjoying it.this is the second time i have seen the redux version, (i have seen the original around four times) i'll say now that the first time i saw it i was disappointed. i was expecting a "classic" film, with lots of war. the fact that willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that is the film seemed unnecessary. this is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot), in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based), as the second time around, you know where the plot is going. i had a similar experience with it's a wonderful life, which is now one of my favourite films.with the big four vietnam films, apocalypse now wins over the rest on atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of platoon, the emotional intensity of the deer hunter, and cannot really be compared to full metal jacket (probably my favourite of the four). apocalypse now is a great piece of work, especially towards the end where it becomes staggering, and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence.

i saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... i went back many more times to see it over and over ... i think 9 times in all. just great is how i would describe it ... i was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of france, the life style the kids began on their own. an ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when i forget that part i find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that! so good that it is available on dvd now ... it was not around for years! tlw

first of all, i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph conrad's "heart of darkness", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. with that said, i believe that this movie is astounding. it is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced "kids" who were sent to fight it. coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story. the acting i felt was definitely all-around up to par. marlon brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. his elucidation to willard at the end of the film reels you in, and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie. those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film, because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all. in my opinion, this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time.

francis ford coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of american cinema. in the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had. i am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. it is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary "hearts of darkness: a filmmaker's apocalypse"; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the vietnam war ever to reach the screen. this may not be the definite vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two vietnam movies made simultaneously, "the deer hunter" and "coming home", or in latter ones as "platoon" and "casualties of war", before vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in "jacob's ladder", or comedies as "good morning, vietnam", among the more respectable. coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.

i decided i need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film. unlike other war films that focus on the event, apocalypse now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip. the sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can't lay your eyes off of it. based off of joseph conrad's heart of darkness, apocalypse now slowly descends its protagonist, willard (martin sheen) into madness, most likely the same way kurtz plunged into insanity. the production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). there is a documentary titled apocalypse now: a filmmakers apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this.the opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film. as the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees, the song "the end" by the doors can be heard. the next shot is of willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. we are informed that he does special missions for the military, mostly assassinations. when his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. "charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the indy 500." the man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people. kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped. willard does not go alone however. he is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles. along the way, they meet lieutenant colonel bill kilgore "hoorah" about the war. willard ponders that if kilgore is that crazy, what could kurtz be like. there are many scenes that portray willards plunge into insanity: the tiger attack, the slaughter of innocent vietnamese, the nonstop rain, the piled dead bodies scattered about, and the deaths of his crew members. when he reaches the kurtz compound, he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (dennis hopper). instead of assassinating kurtz right away, willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. he is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. once they realize their leader has been slain, instead of killing willard, they hail him as their new king. willard rejects the offer and leaves them.the cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. the colors are grain free, something that is rare in older movies. i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery.the acting ensemble is terrific, with everyone playing their parts well. many criticize brando for some reason, but i think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war.the soundtrack and the score are haunting, and provide the mood for the film. i am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? there have been many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from marge simpson when she explains to homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: "your character provides comic relief for the show, like um, marlon brando in apocalypse now." those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious.

i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola's masterpiece. i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica civic auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for charlie and emilio to leave a concert. he was very humble about the praise i shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young captain. this is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of american film history. "charlie don't surf". robert duvall's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic american war hawk in the john wayne tradition. it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks.

even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the vietnam war (jacob's ladder, the deer hunter, apocalypse now, and taxi driver to an extent) one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened. even contemplating the horror feels inhuman. and a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of apocalypse now, coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. loosely based on joseph conrad's 1902 classic, "heart of darkness" which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature, as it were, a la lord of the flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to vietnam. the story is of willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to cambodia after his first tour of duty in vietnam is served. willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in saigon, psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing nicky in the deer hunter. so he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade green beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the nung river, and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives, and killing indiscriminately. this man's name is colonel kurtz, played by marlon brando in the second best role of his career (the best being stanley kowalski in a streetcar named desire). as willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying, his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with kurtz before they even meet. by the time they do, kurtz's methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out-of-place. apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost on the end of the world. the loss of civilization, the loss of judgement, of self. kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a green beret, and his later revelation, is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history. the film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its breaking point - here, it's a lot like the deer hunter, and just as good. apocalypse, however, takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - coppola's sweeping footage of the humid, murky jungles of cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling, darkly humorous, and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, but apocalypse now and forever. the deer hunter is much more up close and personal, you can even tell by the title, and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche, the breaking down of the human soul, and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness, or to limp on. this is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. in "heart of darkness", kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. in apocalypse now, kurtz has left all conflict behind. he is beyond good and evil. he has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death. kurtz indeed is only waiting for death, quoting t. s. eliot in his temple to himself, lost in the jungle. his last words, and the words echoed at the end of the movie, are, "the horror...the horror." he is referring to the infinite void of existence, of the human psyche, and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind, where atrocities are born again. it is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience, in short, that willard experiences on his journey. the end part, at the outpost, almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in the deer hunter, is one of the most deeply, calmly, and seductively disturbing things i've ever seen.

movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. this film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like "the longest day" and "the green berets" which seem more like disney fantasies by comparison. the "apocalypse now!" project, the production and resulting film, is "heart of darkness" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. the cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. this is the plight of joseph conrad's original character kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in ts eliot's "the hollow men" (mistah kurtz, he dead) of 1925. although neither a straight telling of conrad's "heart of darkness" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the vietnam experience, "apocalypse now!" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. "apocalypse" is not just about the "horrors" of war per se, like "platoon" and "the deer hunter", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. apocalypse now! is not so much seen as experienced.the bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, captain benjamin willard (martin sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a us military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of vietnam and cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. his mission is to terminate colonel kurtz (marlon brando), a career army special forces division officer who was the darling of the us military until he went awol and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between vietnam, laos and cambodia. the official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the american public none the wiser.the movie is rather episodic. the journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as sheen and his crew meet different self-contained "aspects" of the war at the ground level. american audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of "the deer hunter" which was released in the previous year. the first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by col kilgore (robert duvall in an oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between general robert e lee and richard wagner. he loves to play "ride of the valkyries" from wagner's "the ring" when he bombards helpless villages. his line "i love the smell of napalm in the morning" is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of hugh heffner and playboy bunnies.despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. the original release (not the later redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between willard and kurtz. the strange discourse between willard and kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. and some of the shots of both sheen and brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. not even the likes of clive barker, wes craven or david cronenberg have anything on coppola in terms of horrific imagery. brando's kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.without giving too much away, coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. according to the documentary "hearts of darkness", coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. he wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom coppola was using as extras in the scenes with kurtz at "his" village. after the viewing, coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of american film-making. love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.this film is not for all tastes just as conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. it's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most american viewers to absorb. it's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban american life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. coppola did not make a family picture. however, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of apocalypse now!. if you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about american sensibility and heroism, better stick with john wayne. but if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond "the evils of war" rhetoric, "apocalypse now" will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it.

captain willard (martin sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to assassinate colonel kurtz (marlon brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. and since kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for capt. willard to understand how col. kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? through willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. but what will he decide to do once he finds him?any movie that can start out with the doors' "the end" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. apocalypse now does this perfectly. i can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the vietnam war and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here. an overall great cast, with the exception of laurence fishburne, of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. i just don't like fishburne, ever since i found out he was cowboy curtis in peewee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. i realize the pettiness of this but i simply do not care. we need to sick gary oldman on him. brando is excellent as col. kurtz and i can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. sheen is also fun to watch as willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. my favorite character in the movie has to be robert duvall's lt. colonel kilgore. before this film i never pictured duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. he simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho air cavalry commander who loves to surf. maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. i also love the smell of napalm in the morning.the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. willard's mission is to kill kurtz, plain and simple. but it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. in the redux version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. i don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. on top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like kurtz' to go completely mad. a big war movie lover, this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter, all of them classics. i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what i've said. all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam war....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view an i think it's a tad better. in the end, apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. as a fellow reviewer has previously stated, an is one of the most ambitious films ever made.

spoilers. this review has been edited due to word limit.`the horror. the horror.' marlon brando, apocalypse now (1979) and apocalypse now redux (2001)the sentence which is as famous as `here's looking at you, kid,' or `are you talkin' to me?' or `may the force be with you,' or `i'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. when it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.what, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? the horror spoken of is the reality of war. the reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. when capt. willard (martin sheen) stands before the dying col. kurtz (marlon brando) at the end of the film, `the horror.the horror.' is the realization of willard's corruptness. he has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. this isn't a typical hollywood ending. in most cases a character gains something, whether it be emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. but willard both gains and loses. he gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. and that is a shocking ending.`apocalypse now' is francis ford coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. this film is wholly different from `the godfather.' it is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. at first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, by the end, original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us.at first it does appear to be another war film. captain willard (sheen) is assigned by an army lieutenant (a young harrison ford) to assassinate a renegade american colonel named kurtz (brando), who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice,' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers, including the boat captain, chief (albert hall), chef (frederic forest), and a very young `larry' fishburne (who later went on to appear as morpheus in `the matrix')."apocalypse now" is in a many ways a modern update of homer's odyssey. as our main character, willard, carries on his journey, he meets an array of original and strange characters, including lt. col. kilgore (robert duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (dennis hopper), whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in "the million dollar hotel," one of the worst films i have ever seen. davies failed to make any connection with an audience; hopper does. he is like the poetic vibe between willard and kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. in this case, he is translating kurtz to willard, although i'm not so sure kurtz needs a translation of willard.many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "apocalypse now" has many. kilgore descending upon a vietnam village playing wagner's "ride of the valkyries" remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history. there is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness. when kilgore kneels down on that beach and says, `i love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory,' we all crack a smile.i won't lie to you: `apocalypse now' is a strange film. it isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze. the end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand marlon brando's significant speeches. but what it all comes down to, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. the horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. kurtz says, `you have a right to kill me. but you have no right to judge me.' brando's character, kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. to many na√Øve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head. but that isn't what francis ford coppola is trying to get across. by fighting in vietnam, kurtz has realized just how great he had it, and how bad some others had it. by walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the na√Øve ones, living our lives in a fool's paradise. we are totally na√Øve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. by seeing how unlucky some vietnamese are, kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. just how easily he could end up like the people around him. and he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. many people think the horror is one thing. it is two. for kurtz, the horror is the reality of how na√Øve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. and after willard murders kurtz, and hears kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. he realizes the effects of war. to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. and what it has done to him. the horror.5/5 stars -

somewhere on imdb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (spielberg, copolla and others are named there). the greatest argument was around spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. the problem with spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.saving ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. an is the best movie i ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. the problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. but a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... maybe coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. you can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. but what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. you can't help but make a comparison with the recent fahrenheit documentary.both copolla and moore tackle similar issues, but while copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... it is really a shame that a film like fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like cannes. but anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the vietnam war, the iraq war, the second world war and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ...

francis ford coppola's "apocalypse now" is not a vietnam war film. do not confuse it with one. it is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. it is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the lord of the rings trilogy. to call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels.opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the doors "the end" as martin sheen's captain benjamin l. willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. willard's mission is to "terminate... with extreme prejudice" colonel kurtz (marlon brando) who has invariably gone awol in the far reaches of the cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is "out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. and he is still in the field commanding troops." kurtz is a delusional colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. for willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. along the way, willard educates himself on all things kurtz. during sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. kurtz was a highly decorated and respected green beret. he was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that willard is being led. the descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. but willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find kurtz. as he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. we know that willard's slow decay will parallel that of kurtz's.marlon brando has been revered for decades. his presence: unmatchable. his genius: undeniable. but for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. he is most certainly not. brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. the man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. his colonel kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.if the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than francis ford coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. it is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, coppola contemplated suicide. the film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of martin sheen's haunted soldier willard.i can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. at the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. audacity aside, apocalypse now is pure film-making. my respect and admiration for mr. coppola is of the highest order. but i shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. it is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. but we still have the great ones like coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.that depth in apocalypse now is the step into madness. the killing can disturb. the loss of innocence can unhinge. but it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. if the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis.

i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (hearts of darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the film's greatest asset. you actually feel like your in vietnam.all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall ("i love the smell of napalm in the morning!!") martin sheen, and the great marlon brando.a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky, weird and cerebral near the end. well, remeber what coppolla said about this movie, "this film is not about vietnam, it is vietnam!" what he means is that this film is about madness and not the war.this movie is based on the short story "heart of darkness" by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book. i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion.this is perfect, challenging film that is dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every single possible way.a true classicrating:10

one of the most poetic narrative films ever made, wagonmaster is nonetheless a difficult film to immediately like. i love this movie, but i recommend seeing some of john ford's other westerns before taking a look at this one. the first time i saw it i was 18 years old and i hadn't seen too many other westerns, and i hated it. i thought it was incredibly boring. i kept waiting for something to happen. it took several years for me to love this picture. first, i fell in love with westerns in general -- the traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of talking, etc -- and that made me realize when i saw wagonmaster again that a lot is happening in it after all.i also was simply a more experienced moviegoer at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling, and to listen to what each image was telling me. wagonmaster is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career.the movie is a celebration of a way of life, and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other ford westerns. actually, that's not really as accurate as saying that, rather, it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns. (the other westerns have exterior action and interior emotion.) it quite beautifully places its mormon pioneers in the context of nature. there are many shots of animals and children -- not for any surface, narrative purpose, but for illustrating this idea. that is why the movie can be called a poem. it isn't about the surface story (which barely exists) nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea, and it gets this idea across through composition, editing, sound and music. in fact, one could argue that this is a purer form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of the film, rather than having to first service a "story."give this movie a chance, and allow it to exist on its own terms, not the terms of other westerns or other movies.

john ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'wagon master' made after two big indian-cavalry epics... it is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... it didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...photographically, it is extremely simple... the camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons... they come-and go-while the camera remains immobile and the audience stays a spectator to the march of history, not a participant in it... of course, when ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'stagecoach,' he knows just how to do it... but "wagon master" is a tender, nostalgic look backward...filled with traditional western songs rendered by the sons of the pioneers, it tells of the trek west to utah (in 1879) of a mormon wagon train led by ward bond in the role of elder wiggs, and two young horse traders (ben johnson and harry carey jr). and in a series of beautiful images, as the wagon train fights outlaws, indians and nature in its struggle to reach the 'promised land,' the modest 'wagon master' manages to capture the history and legend of the west... ford himself has said that 'wagon master' (of which he wrote the original story) was among the three films of his which 'came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve.'ford's career as a western director was astonishing... more than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family, society, and the american way of life... ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and lawmen whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after... these early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned, and the civilized townsfolk who followed must always hold them in fear and respect... ford's westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approach...in 'wagon master,' for example, folk songs on the sound track tell us of the hardships of the pioneers of a century ago, and ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion... in one sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance... to fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand, and with this ritual celebration ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the land...it's a lovely-to-look-at film, full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism, and it is easy to understand why ford found it so satisfying¬Ö it never breaks faith with the mood and style set in the first few sequences¬Ö but one is left wondering whether the ultra-romantic best suits the chosen theme¬Öthe wagon-train experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nerve-wracking ordeals that man (with his womankind) ever set himself¬Ö it must have been riddled with doubts¬ówas i wrong to sell up everything and come? how can we hope to survive? how will we contend the other end?¬óalmost every other aching step of the way¬Öyet none of this feeling really comes through in "wagon master." the journey¬ósuch is the general ebullience¬ódoes not strike one as particularly hazardous¬Ö it could be, of course, that the mormons were so 'high' on religious spirit that this tended to act as an anesthetic¬Ö in other words their reactions weren't those of normal human weakness... if so, ford was right and the doubters were wrong¬Öwhat is beyond doubt is the right and proper ebullience, especially at first meeting, of ben johnson and harry carey jr. this is the essence of light-hearted adventurous youth, particularly one feels of western youth of those extraordinary times¬Ö it's a remarkable relationship and it remains lodged in the mind¬Ö

perry mason: the case of the fatal fashion finds perry and della street in new york getting an award from the american bar association. an undefeated trial record ought to get some recognition i would think. anyway a friend of della's, fashion editor diana muldaur gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival, valerie harper and in fact raymond burr and barbara hale witness a confrontation between the two at a posh eatery.these two rivals have a thing going that makes hedda and louella look like school girls. of course harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much.the same perpetrator also ran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. this throws perry with his trusty investigative lawyer, william moses in an alliance with some mobsters. seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to mete out some justice in their usual manner. one thing i could not get is when moses and mobster robert clohessy track down the perpetrator i cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case. of course clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just don't have.but the best part of this particular mason entry is scott baio as the young rather full of himself assistant district attorney introducing himself to raymond burr saying how he studied all of his cases and looked forward to beating him. foolish boy.in fact my favorite scene is burr and baio at a sidebar with the judge. baio was wanting to reopen his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents. burr catches him off guard and says he has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on cross examination. absolutely priceless.scott baio is the best thing in this particular perry mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else.

i saw this film on the same night i saw 6 other shorts. this one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. it comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.this is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. amazing performances. the 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. the acting and directing are very powerful.2. beautifully shot. the lighting, framing and general filming are striking. the 35mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts. and what a difference it makes. the filming is worthy of this film stock.3. strong story. often short films try to do too little or too much with the time. or they are trying to tell a predictable story. this is a good balance of telling you an interesting story, without drawing it out too long or leaving you unsatisfied. you wonder what will happen next, while at the same time, feeling you saw something happen.nice score, too. compliments without overpowering.if you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.

saw this last night at the 7th annual nyc home film festival -- a rather tumultuous venue that quieted down for this sweet and touching two-woman film.the relationship between the two -- one, older and blind, the other, a twenty- something who helps her with her mail -- is established deftly, and its depth is readily apparent.there are no car chases, explosions, or mind-boggling special effects -- just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped.see if it you can!

in the world of "shorts" (most of which aren't), this film is a gem.a quiet, concise peek into the world of a young woman who's a reader for a blind woman, here the stellar elizabeth franz - this film bears the textures, layers and visual storytelling of a sumptuously painted still life.the dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is stunning, and the direction sure, clear and compelling. i saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd fell quiet.that says it all.

i viewed the reader at sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. the technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that duncan rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. but it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. duncan rogers' tight script was just what this evening of "shorts" needed. it neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. the reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by rogers and beautifully acted. duncan rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together, i'm looking forward to his next finished project. k.

i saw "the reader" at a film festival in manhattan this week. it touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. in ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. duncan rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. what i really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. these are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. this is no small feat. haven't we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format, or stage stories that weren't properly adapted to screen? i applaud "the reader" for really doing it right, and i encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously. worth every moment!

the reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. well acted, directed, shot and written. i was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. the performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. the actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. less is much better in this case. this film is a prime example of how these low budget contracts benefit actors as well as film makers.

'apocalypse now redux', francis ford coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film i have ever seen. capt. benjamin willard (martin sheen) is a vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into cambodia to 'terminate the position' of col. kurtz (marlon brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. escorting him up the river to cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they encounter several interesting people (most notably is robert duvall's kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations. 'apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. it is more 'full metal jacket' than 'platoon'. the running time of 'apocalypse' is over three hours, but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived, i was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed. the beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me, however. after seeing this film, i am convinced that coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. the 'godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone, and shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition. with 'apocalypse', there is an incredible usage of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving brando and sheen, almost become a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. another gorgeous scene was when cpt. willard and jay hicks (frederic forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes, and come across a tiger. the sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. while everything else was almost a muted grey, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly striking. another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying duvall and company attack the small village while playing wagner. this could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene, but instead coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene, with duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them'. the performances in 'apocalypse' are first class. much has been made of the amount of money brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble he caused. regardless of this, he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time i have seen him really unleash in a film ¬ñ and duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony kilgore. 'apocalypse now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film, 'i love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al) but i knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience. i have not seen the original cut of 'apocalypse now' so i cannot compare it to this newer cut, but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced. 8/10--shelly

i saw the short titled "the reader" recently and found that the movie was well planned and executed. i really felt for both characters that morgan hallett and elizabeth franz portray in this film. elizabeth was able to show great range with her blind character and left me feeling emotionally connected. morgan was able to sell to me that she was totally committed in keeping "sissy" or franz protected from the grief of losing her sister who had been living in copenhagen. the great thing about the film was in the short running time and budget of only ten thousand dollars, duncan rodgers was able to make a very well made film that kept the interest of the viewer. rodgers has a great insight into the actor's ability and transition great camera angles to showcase their talent. i always feel if a director can make a great film with a small budget then what can he or she do with a much larger one. great job duncan!!

the reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. a poignant story, told simply through well written dialog, beautifully painted images, a score that seamlessly weaves it's way through the narrative, and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace.i saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened. but none of the other shorts had all the elements of great film-making coming together in one film as the reader did. the reader commanded the attention of every festival-goer in the room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional lives of the characters.duncan rogers has created a beautiful film and i hope to see more from this director be it more shorts or perhaps a feature length film.

i have a little hobby of finding really cool pics out there that are pretty much unknown -and then letting people know about them this one is on top of my list for getting the word out this summer. this indie film (and i really mean indie--not miramax, fox searchlight indie) might be easy to overlook in the big maze of celluloid, but if you want something completely different--you have to check this one out. basically, i thought it was totally great. i should have known from the dvd cover, front and back ,that this was going to be something totally different, but, they all say that their stuff is different to hook you. well this one really is totally different. it's in your face: beautiful and scary and unashamed to tell you to wake up. war, peace, 9/11, poetry, even a eerie sort of music video set to an old time "patriotic" song and a weird guy in an rv. need i say more? just see it.

i have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. i really can't come up with one. i think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.there are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than usa t.m., i'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. this dvd, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't. it is philosophical, maybe, but it bypasses the information mode and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does. it makes you feel but sometimes you don't even know why. you are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling. when you watch it, notice how well it is put together. it may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who look for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.

in 1858 tolstoy wrote this in his diary: "the political is not compatible with the artistic, because the former, in order to prove, has to be one-sided." this thought from a great mind is applicable to usa the movie. the film might be read by those with a narrow focus as a 90 minute slam of bush, cheney et. al. as well as a ripping of america as an out-of-control imperialistic force that will ultimately be destroyed by its own folly and thirst for power. the more open-minded viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this dvd a testament to postmodernist thought, as the main character breaks up into bits and pieces surrounded by recurring visuals of the natural world contrasted with the man-made constructions; towers, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. above all the ominous threat of wars that have been and are to come smolder throughout. war and rumors of war are what is created, destroyed and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds.

just see it! it's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. see it more than once. everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. the clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. the structure is non-linear and cyclical. motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. expectations regarding "plot" and character" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity. this is a part of a review: "usa the movie is emotionally intense, intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing, in surprising and unconventional ways." dion dennis, phd

usa the movie is like this: you take a nap on a long hot sunday afternoon. it feels great to close your eyes and let your worries drift away. soon you're lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you're dreaming but you still can't wake up--not that you want to. you go with the flow, and soon you're in a kind of weird alice in wonderland story complete with characters you didn't think you could dream up. they're telling you all kinds of crazy stuff about war and peace while taking you through a trip into the past and even the future. the dream starts to get heavier and you feel like it's going down a path you can't control. maybe you want to wake up so you try to open your eyes but you can''t . now there's destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what could be truth or could be lies. you're seeing images that flicker and change and then get clear, but do you even want to see what you're brain is creating for you? finally you're lost in a myth world and you realize the end has come. the end of the world and the end of the dream. it's over. what do you wake up to? what do you do next? maybe you'll write down that dream because you know dreams like don't happen too often-- and when they do you better pay attention. or maybe you'll crack a beer and forget the whole thing. bad idea. don't forget.

it's funny because i read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. you'll probably either love it or hate it too. i think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. i'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about afghanistan and iraq. i have to admit that i was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place. especially afghanistan and i feel guilty about that. the music through the movie was beautiful. i kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks. personally, i thought the audio was great. it seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the rv with jim, the main character, or in his head. everything not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. anyway, this is a very amazing dvd which made me cry.

i like movies that show real people "americans" and tell truth. the movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. it played here in norway fine (amazon says above that it's usa/canda but the box states "all regions". i have to say it is not for the american viewers. it played in here in world raw views, a theater. i saw it and later i ordered it. the cut was different and much better. see it and you will like it or maybe hate it. sorry bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense. get angry and hate it. disagree with everything in it but i for one stand by it. it's not for the empty minds. it is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense. i loved owen's words and the poem made me cry.

thank god that there are films out there that don't follow the same old hollywood crap formula. i think the digital revolution and the dvd revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it. i love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches. it really was like taking a trip through the soul of america and that soul is disturbed and confused. what really blew my mind was the way they used martin luther king's speeches about vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. i found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. i've heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like i understood his message in a way i'd never thought about.what can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be? in fact, there's no credits at all in the film. you have to access them by selecting them in the features. somehow that made me think a lot. all in all i can't say enough about this dvd. brilliant.

during the final throes of the vitnam war, our central character, capt. willard (martin sheen) is dispatched by the cia on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade us marine commander, colonel kurtz (marlon brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country.the entire narrated story of what willard sees and does as he is ferried up the da nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the anglo-saxon psyche: if we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. kurtz had eventually come to know this.unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in kurtz's darkened lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his unilateral 'surrender' in return for willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.the bonding between the two men whilst kurtz cross-examines willard,--interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film. the closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. coppolla has made, intentionally or not, the ultimate anti-war statement, one that should resonate through the ages.

the whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are "blue". the blue state mentality. this is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (the usa). it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a us citizen gets just by being a us citizen. but i'm so sick of bitching about this. it doesn't do any good. i haven't taken much action lately and i wonder how many people have. maybe i'm just down because my job was "outsourced" last month and now i'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to india and other places overseas. i'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war. these days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there "patriotism". anyway, back to this review: usa the movie is an obscure dvd that makes me realize that some people have taken action, whether it's through politics, protesting or arts or media. the filmmaker is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go outside the norm, frustrated, unique, astute etc. i looked through the whole site that's linked to the dvd and got lost in all the articles, essays etc.that are there. the dvd does that too, has references to different times, views and historical points. sometimes someone does something out there.

a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title. it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. i'm not sure i agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, i can't always tell exactly where he stands) but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals. most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect. i'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie. in fact, most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another. that's not to say that there aren't "characters" (real people), but except for "jim" the protagonist ( a kind of '60's drop out with an erratic state of mind) the others come and go pretty quickly. a few make a very powerful impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself. when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway, it is a very powerful moment. on the cover of the dvd is the quote "the danger is clear" which is taken from president bush's speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq. in retrospect, hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered.

completely worth checking out. saw it on mlk's birthday 2006 and it hit me big time. sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change. all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out. just keep on going. don't mean to be a downer because that's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves. what happens when we keep being told by the best people like mlk what needs to happen to pull us out of our "dead end road" but we don't listen. i know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are? just keep going, i guess. this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do. that's what i consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything: something that gets you thinking and keyed up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless.

i saw it in europe-plex. great movie!! this film is an exploration of the spirit and the flesh in modern times. protagonist jim kirk, drives an unwieldy rv across america, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. he is middle-aged and confused . he fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. he is the flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. the spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field. the spirit eventually collides with the flesh and kirk goes down, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. he's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to he waywardness of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. we're all in the same denial and so we, like kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him.

almost four years after the iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. that's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the american way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? you bet it is. this movie said so from the beginning. it is kind of freaky how much the film,or should i say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. it is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future. there was a point when i felt the hairs standing up on the back of my neck as gw announced that 'major combat operations are over" on top of a visual of a broken down rv being towed away with the american flag waving in the rear-view mirror. you have to see it to understand what i mean. but even if you are apolitical or even if you are pro-war, this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it is so embedded in history.

as i peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the imdb have posted on this film, i find it very interesting how few ,"middle of the road" comments there are. everyone either loves it, or they hate it. having seen apocalypse now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on dvd (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), i can say without hesitation that i am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. "why would you like a film that's so confusing?" ask many of my associates. the answer is this: forget the war, forget the brutality....this is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. they (big brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (am i the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the "conformity police" out to eliminate the individual. hmmmmmm....draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? with the deepest respect to mr. coppola, whom i believe is one of the best directors of all time, i think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. the subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. again i must reiterate: i think ff coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. so if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. i think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. or maybe not! no matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to coppola for his masterful story-telling style!

my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.the trailer of "nasaan ka man" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. the movie exceeded our expectations. the cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. jericho rosales was really very good, so's claudine barretto. the fact that i despised diether ocampo proves he was effective at his role. i have never been this touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? congratulations to star cinema!! way to go, jericho and claudine!!

this is a great tv movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast.the only problem this movie has is that it hasn't stood the test of time as well as it might have.despite this, it's definitely worth viewing, particularly if you are an alan alda or ruth gordon fan.

i am trying to find somewhere to purchase a dvd/vhs copy of the movie "isn't it shocking?" i was 7 years old when i saw this movie and i lived in the town where it was filmed. a couple of items from my family were used in the movie as props and a couple of my friend's homes were used in a couple of the scenes. the filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community. i have only seen the film once originally and i would like to get a copy so now i can show my family the film. i have done extensive searches online with not luck and i was wondering if anyone would have any ideas on trying to get a copy of this movie?

this is a very sweet coming-of-age movie, very funny, and russell crowe is amazing! those who know him only from gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities. arthur baskin (his character) is one of the best onscreen nerdy virgins i have ever seen1 watch this movie--how can we get it re-released in ntsc format?

a film is beyond all expectations, an excellent insight into the human condition. what exactly drives mila to have her ass painted. what could push a human so far that there only way to escape is to have there rear passage repeatedly painted by strangers.this film is not afraid to stair squarley in the face of the ass painting issue. simply breathtaking. roll on the sequel or whatever comes next from the geniuses who made this.

i have read all of jane austen's novels right the way through once a year every year since i was 9 years old and received the modern library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. i loved this movie for its romance and for the music, which stayed, hauntingly, in my head. it was an interpretation of course, not an emma or a sense and sensibility, but something quite different and something catherine herself would have loved. and oh to be loved by this passionate henry! this was the henry of catherine's imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and which was promised to us by the practical jane austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely catherine will indeed be one. i wonder if jane was being entirely satirical in her novel. perhaps, she too, could imagine such a henry. i haven't seen the film in many years, at least a decade. but, i have been yearning for it ever since.

i think this film version of northanger abbey is actually quite good. it certainly is amusing. well, it's not a masterpiece as pride and prejudice ('95) but there's very good stuff in it.. especially the city of bath setting!!! ..the royal crescent, the roman baths, the fascinating georgian atmosphere.. that is excellent. if you are a bath fan like myself, you'll love watching this film! the performances may sound a bit too "melodramatic" but i've got the impression that this film, like the novel itself, is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period. the only drawback is probably the female lead as i personally have another idea of catherine morland's physical appearance. the music is also a bit "unusual".. but i strangely find it acceptable despite it's got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed. i'm wondering what would dear old jane think...:)

don't watch this movie expecting the jane austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. this time around, the premise of northanger abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! in this version,catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. by day she is very prim and demure, and her swain henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. but as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid! at the beginning of the story, catherine's visions of sex are based entirely on the gothic novels she devours in bed. it is both heartwarming, sexy, and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome henry "dissolves" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains! at the same time, it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head! later, after being invited to henry's castle, catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning. jumping into bed, she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully, her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. little by little, however, those pretty blue eyes droop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire. this time, catherine dreams she is in elizabethan times, waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the "banditi!" it's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits. she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation! but then, after a shot of her running frantically to escape, we are back to the daylight world, where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep. it's worth noting that catherine's heavy-eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been! ultimately, of course, catherine's stern and unimaginative lover henry divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. it's interesting that catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships. in the next scene, she tearfully burns her gothic romance and throws herself shamefaced and sobbing onto the bed. significantly, this turning point is also marked by catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time, there are no dreams of make believe passion. presumably, catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing.though katherine schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull. i'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level.if you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real gothic setting, i highly recommend the perilous gard by elizabeth marie pope.

vhs - i have watched this over and over and loved every minute of it so much so i have now ordered the dvd i only wished the film could have lasted longer. i never worry about what other people think i prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever. make up your own mind and don't let others put you off! i have all jane austen's bbc series but this is my favourite. i see there is to be a new northanger abbey released in 2007 which i will buy when it comes out but it will not stop me watching northanger abbey released in the 80's.

i've just watched this again on the bbc channel 4. it's not jane austen's best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation. i suspect the assembly rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown; perhaps they couldn't afford the extras. also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? i've never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when i've been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the 18/19th century in bath.i cannot believe the us/canada reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout. the "gothic" scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly. i'm sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews. a propos of nothing, does anyone else think that peter firth gets to look more like colin baker (a former doctor who) or vice-versa the older they both get?

i just checked out northanger abbey from the local library, and wasn't expecting much. imagine my suprise at this gothic treat! northanger abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen, with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets. the glory of the movie is that it never reveals all: your imagination runs free, running with the imagination of the main character, one kathrine m. she is a girl of wild imaginations, a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her (and our) real world.if i were to use one word to describe this excellent movie, it would be surrealistic. dreams are woven throughout the movie, enhancing the mood. sometimes, it is hard to tell what is real and what is not; this is intentional, i believe.atmosphere reigns supreme. the music is not what you'd expect of a movie by jane austen: it is eerie, flute and drum based, high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear. if a soft, pleasant tune were playing in northanger abbey, it would be positively inviting. now, it is foreboding, a grim and stark-walled palace of madmen. (but! the characters! you shall have to see them for yourself!)if you are looking for a most enjoyable evening, look no further than northanger abbey.

two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. the comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. it really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the aussie humor. they portray it very well and very realistically. of course, they're helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writer/director gregor jordan. i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it, and he heavily criticised it, basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone. i think that that's just rubbish. this film isn't trying to be pulp fiction, the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite. without wanting to sound superior or arrogant, i think to fully understand this film; the humor, the sincerity, the characters, etc....you have to be australian, or at least understand the culture, which the other guy obviously didn't have the faintest clue about. some americans, whose reviews of certain non-american films, seem ignorant to (and have trouble comprehending) anything that isn't an american product. it's a real shame, because this is a really great film. the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real, sincere and sweet way. i'm very proud to have this film in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.

having seen, and loved this film in australia, i was very keen to get me paws on a copy. i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it's a very different edit.the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier. the uk ,and i presume european, edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy's dead brother.and in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit.it is not a serious criticism, but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assured.i can't say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market?so careful about which one you go for.i went for both.

mild spoilers....and that's 'top ten of all time.' i stumbled across 'two hands' by accident (maybe that made it all the more special -- no inflated expectations) on ifc one night, and couldn't believe that i hadn't heard anything about it. now that heath ledger is getting more famous in the usa, i'm sure it's more available. at the time, i was telling friends about the film, and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional ifc showing.anyway, in the black-comedy/gangster genre it fits in well with my other favorites, and everybody in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve. bryan brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his small son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. also hilarious is the quick-edit fate of a random car thief. even heath was pretty good in it. at the time, i vaguely remembered him from a short-lived series on fox called 'roar.' hopefully gregor jordan will make another hit, but as far as i'm concerned, this is his best yet.

so i turned on the tv today at 1:00 pm on a sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately. the movie was excellent.there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one i don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it wasn't his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck, second i don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing panda's money, and then the other thief kills panda at the end, so they steal his money twice, and kill him how is that good?

this deceptively laid-back, low-key, casually paced aussie crime thriller unravels with a casual ease and relaxed self-confidence that's a delight to behold. eager beaver working class kid jimmy (an appealingly feckless heath ledger) yearns to make something out of his unrewarding ordinary life. jimmy gets his big break when local crime kingpin pando (an outstanding bryan brown) assigns him an easy courier gig which entails delivering $10 grand to an old lady. jimmy finds himself knee deep in serious trouble when he loses pando's money. writer/director gregor jordan's engagingly simple tale of how things aren't always what they're cracked up to be, young love, all actions having consequences and that hoary old chestnut about how crime doesn't pay works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well-observed minor quirky details, a strong subtext concerning man's duel capacity for both good and evil, a nice sense of unforced irony, the chillingly matter-of-fact way the violence is presented, and the marvelous grounding of the assorted complexly drawn warts'n'all low-life characters in an instantly recognizable and totally believable banal day-to-day reality (e.g., panda is shown playing scrabble with a flunky and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a fellow hood to talk with his son over the phone). judging from his finely shaded and two-fisted portrayal of the cunning, not to be trifled with pando, bryan brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to ever grace celluloid. a sturdy and satisfying little sleeper.

"two hands" is a hilarious australian gangster movie set in really sultry sydney. i bet tourists never envisage sydney and bondi to look like it did in this film: all sweaty bodies, oppressive nighttime and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. heath ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local king's cross boss's gang. he looked rather magnificent in his green wife beater and blue patterned budgie smuggler. a sweaty tattooed bod does become him. i always had him down as a "home & away" boy, and he has been in that soap, which is a little sweatier than the weetbix-insipid "neighbours". the film is really worth watching for its combination of sardonic humour and nasty violence - the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon. totty awards: country girl love interest city brother and tattooed streetkid.

i had never heard of this movie, but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting, so i figured i'd give it a shot. i found it to be very enjoyable. heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown. i won't go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown. from their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne, who plays ledger's love interest. i would definitely recommend this movie.

many years ago i saw this movie (on television maybe?) and loved it. so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation. it did. set in sydney's notorious king's cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex stores thrive), it tells the story of "jimmy" (played by heath ledger). jimmy is a young man...maybe late teens or thereabouts, who hasn't had a stable family background. he is on the fringes of society, and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). he is aware of an underworld figure called "pando", who is a local bigwig in the cross. it's jimmy's hope that he will find himself on pando's radar and get 'in' with him...a short-cut to upward social mobility, he hopes.one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex (played by the charming rose byrne). you just know that a love story will play out between them. on that night as well, jimmy is first contacted by pando (played by bryan brown). pando has a 'job' for jimmy. it's the 'foot in the door' that jimmy has been waiting for!to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer. stylistically, if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies, you should be in tune with what to expect...twists and turns and black comedy.what's so great about this movie is its very 'australian-ness'. it's no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie, but a genuine australian contribution to the genre. a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together. sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they're doing there. in the end, all these 'loose ends' tie together beautifully. it's sort of like a celluloid moebius strip.a highlight of the movie is bryan brown's character of pando. pando likes puzzles, and it's fun to see him play games with his cronies. it's the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable...his taste in music, for starters!of the heath ledger movies i have seen (the dark knight, 10 things i hate about you), this is perhaps his best role. wasn't taken with "10 things". if you are a heath ledger fan (ledger recently died a tragic, accidental death), this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role, i think. there is great chemistry between ledger and byrne in this movie-so, on one level, it functions as nice love story.this movie doesn't have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies, but it does have some adult themes...scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. in that sense, it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers, but it's not a movie that gore-hounds will get excited about either. lastly, i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this. usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting. this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknesses...i.e. it has a great story, great acting and a great script. we need more popular, quality movies like this to be made here in australia. highly recommended. other australian movies i have loved include:breaker morant (10/10) mad max 2 (10/10) my brilliant career (not reviewed here by me yet) proof (nr) the devil's playground (nr) the year my voice broke (nr) bad boy bubby (nr. a great, dark comedy) the dish (nr. a great, charming comedy)

"two hands" is an entertaining, funny story about australian lowlifes. the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.the clueless jimmy, portrayed with acumen by heath ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity. the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses. the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau.the film is well-directed and well-acted. the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film.

this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in kings cross, sydney. the plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown. the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. the setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. eg. when one crim is searching for bullets for his gun. i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies, and in this regard, the movie did not offend. it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown. the rest of the cast did an ok job, without any real stand-outs that i remember. the direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment. the main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake. the director, gregor jordan, deserves special mention. rating in my book - 7 (of 10).

if you enjoyed films like pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, and lock, stock, and two smoking barrels, you are going to love two hands. it has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained through the whole film. like pulp fiction, it has the wacky scenarios that the characters get into and how they deal with them. along with gallipoli and picnic at hanging rock, this has to be one of the best australian films i've seen. it also stars a young heath ledger before he got real big in the states.this is a terribly underrated movie that i believe is just as good as pulp fiction and those greats. you have to see it!

based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot summaries, i didn't expect much from 'two hands'. but how wrong i was. from start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. if you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch. i'm hoping heath ledger's tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film. he was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one not to be missed. don't make the mistake of judging and discarding this amazing film before you've seen it.

it's hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. that being said, two hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring. the absurdity of the goings-on, the thick australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also. the plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin. he doesn't; the job only lands him in trouble when he fancies a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach, which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree. however, all is not rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences...the film is made up of a cast of unknowns; at least, it was back in 1999, as nowadays heath ledger is something of a name. he doesn't impress too much here, however, as his performance is mostly of the one-note variety and he doesn't make for a very compelling lead. he fits the movie in that he's australian and looks naive; but beyond that, he's not the best lead i've ever seen in a movie. if you ask me, bryan brown gave the best performance here. he might not have a great deal of screen time, but he steals every scene he's in and it's him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour. he's got nothing to do with the best sequence, however, which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film. on the whole, i can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films; as the weirdness is plentiful, and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable; but if you're not a fan of this sort of film, i can't really say that two hands will float your boat. it's not a must see, but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it...you probably wont completely regret it.

a refreshing black comedy starring some of australia's finest. in the same way that lock stock and 2 smoking barrels captured the funny side of london gangsters, two hands rips through the sydney underworld. it wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone.an australian classic. if australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on.

jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of sydney, australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old jimmy, (heath ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. the gangsters, (led by bryan brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. that's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. but this mob tickle your funny bone as well. a clever structured script by jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.

`5 years ago if you were to watch an australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like ¬ëcobber' and generally being the classic underdog.luckily australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day ¬ëclassics' such as blackrock, moulin rouge, chopper, yolngu boy and sample people.in this evolution of film we also find two hands.set in sydney's kings cross, two hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town. pando, played by bryan brown, is a sydney mob boss. he's the king of organised crime wearing thongs, carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami. he's vicious, but real. as are his ¬ëmob', holding gun's to someone's head in one scene and then playing boardgames in the next. they are well respected and if they ask you for a favour, you don't say no.enter jimmy, played by heath ledger. jimmy is your average aussie guy in his early twenties. he's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone's bad side, so when pando asks jimmy to deliver $10,000, jimmy accepts.things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while jimmy is at the beach. so now jimmy is $10,000 in dept to a major mob boss. from here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with jimmy and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money, jimmy and alex (the love interest, played by rose byrne), pando trying to find jimmy and, of course, the two teenagers and their new found prosperity. the concept is deepened by the narrator, jimmy's dead brother, michael, who was killed by pando and his gang years earlier.in the end all the storylines connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and stun the audience. i thoroughly enjoyed it.

the inspiration for this film was the fact that american gangsters are well dresses, but the aussies, well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter, then you can dress as badly as you want and people won't criticize you.jimmy is fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes bouncer and is offered work by pando, the local gangster boss in the cross (that is, australia's notorious kings cross district, not the cross of london fame as many a british backpacker finds out the hard way).due to feelings of love he stuffs up a job, loses a lot of money and has to get it to pando before pando and his heavies can kill him.lots of dark humour, interesting action, revelations about the australia's underside and human nature. it is very centred in the australian nature and explores the nature of australian criminals (versus the american and british ones).one problem is that each of the elements of the story don't have enough substance and depth, but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously, so as an overall package it is worthwhile.team it up with "chopper" and "dirty deeds" for your aussie crime fest or "lock stock and two smoking barrels" and "miller's crossing" for an international falling short of the criminal gangs fest.by the way, bryan brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies. here is one of his great movies.

jimmy (heath ledger) is given a simple job by pando (bryan brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. jimmy rings pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. pando and his boys try their best to locate jimmy, meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him. so now jimmy goes into hiding to organise a bank robbery to get pando's money back. also throughout this mess he meets the innocently sweet alex (rose byrne) and together they're in for one hell of a ride through sydney's king cross."two hands" is simply an engrossing pick-me-up film that's brisk, exhilarating and incredibly fresh. what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in-your-face violence¬Ö what, how's that fresh you ask? well, because it takes us into the underworld where the australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs (flip flops) and footy shorts, done up cars and a can of beer in the hand¬Ö and don't forgot the australian sense of humour, dry and sarcastic. you can say it owes a lot to the likes of "pulp fiction", "goodfellas" (a fave of mine) and "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" for its inspiration, but for me it still stands on its own. the film has real mixture of light-hearted moments, but also a mean streak to it with some unexpected shocks and black humour that can actually be disturbing. you just don't know what's coming and it has a nice touch of snappy irony (especially the ending) and great timing with its humour. one scene involving a bank robbery will have you in stitches, i guarantee you. the plot's outline is really a coming to age story (or about the road not taken), with a punching love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it off. most of the sub-plots were cleverly constructed and interlocked, well maybe it could've gone without the supernatural element involving jimmy's dead brother, but in the overall context the diverse plot seems to all click together. intense, natural and crisp dialogue filled the outrageously colourful script, with quick jabs of aussie slang/twang - i'm fair dinkum! what truly made the film was that of bryan brown's performance of pando. he just gave his character such a deviously charismatic/nasty persona that when he wasn't on screen his presence was still felt. he gave his character two sides - one being a prick, but the other side is such a good bloke. a young rose byrne glows with her nervously sweet/quirky character alex. she looked radially gorgeous and added a bubbly personality. then you got heath ledger who fit's the buck as the naive jimmy. great supporting cast involved with the likes of susie porter, tom long, david field, steve vidler and steve le marquand. such raw performances are achieved and from that you get riveting, fun and believable characters. pumping rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with the likes of powderfinger and alex lloyd provide a cool vibe. also being shot on location in sydney's king cross really helped it stick out by holding a life of its own and showing the australian way of life. gliding camera tricks captured the city's backdrop superbly, especially the piercing nightlife. this was a film that when it ended i was totally satisfied with what i got. overall, a slickly paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do... a fun, clever and crazy roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement.i say, it's a successful aussie take on "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" by director/writer gregor jordan in his debut film. if you come across it, don't hesitate to it give it a go.

"two hands" is a good addition to the australian film catalogue.it is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the australians have developed on their own.heath ledger is basically a good if naive guy. wanting to get on he falls in with a local "big" man pando (bryan brown). but at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets alex (rose byrne). here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected. after getting on the wrong side of pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film. yes, jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it. although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.heath ledger is excellent as jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, rose is hypnotic as alex and bryan is marvellous as usual. this is a small ensemble of characters are believable and i found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.this dvd is usually in the cheap aisle so i would recommend adding it too your dvd collection, it would be money well spent.8 out of 10

this story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. as a boy, i enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. books like "call of the wild", "white fang", "the frontiersman" and "my side of the mountain", influenced me tremendously. i wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when i saw this movie on television in 1975. i wanted to be just like "trapper". however, as i got older i found i was just too domesticated to live like that. nonetheless, i still romanticize about living that kind of life. i agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in "disneyisque" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then i think you find yourself pleasantly touched. i make it a point to watch this movie once a year. after thirty-one years, i still get a chill running through me when i see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the trapper.-good luck old-timer and stay free-ps if you want to read more about the true story, i found this link on the mad trapper of rat river:http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/nwt/madtrapper.htm

director: tay garnett, ford beebe, cast: mike mazurki, vic christy, fritz ford, tay garnett.based on the number of comments i see on imdb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. this seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that i remember. my mom took me and my little brother to see this film at the garland theater in spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and i still remember it.i am going by memory here but i believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him. i believe it to be set in 1800's alaska. a narrator tells the story of the trapper played by mike mazurki. really, this is a very good film with a great setting. it could be compared to the 1981 film death hunt with charles bronson. the two films have a very similar story line. the main difference between the two is death hunt is an adult orientated film whereas challenge is a family friendly film. mike mazurki and tay garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which i find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of alaska. this was the last film made by tay garnett before he died which was just a few years later. they both had been around since the silent era.

"challenge to be free" was one of the first films i saw as a child. it was also one of the first vhs tapes that i owned. i hadn't seen the movie in years, so yesterday i decided to stick the tape in and watch it. wow. the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it. i think now that i am older i can better apreciate the values that are implanted in the movie. (self-reliance, the value of freedom, and the love of nature) it is a "b" movie, to be sure, but it's one that you'll remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.

this twisted comedy is well acted and directed. very funny and the production quality is outstanding. it is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.everyone can identify with calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. travis davis plays the role superbly! richard moll as tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. the old man adds to the humor of the story. and who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!this short will bring lots of laughs. and don't miss the credits as they are playing at the end!

when i watch a short like boy-next-door, i find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. on the one hand, i'm happy. i'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. on the other hand i find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. tv and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. then you see someone like davis, who, without the "benefit" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem. producers and network suits need to turn to the travis davis' out there for material and stop awarding deals to people simply because their resume or agent may demand they should. boy-next-door has, hopefully, gained the attention of the right people to facilitate more work from davis. it's really fun and very well done!

had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award. and i have to say, it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film! the script is well written and keeps things escalating. it also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. you don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. the jokes are quick and unexpected. the plot keeps us guessing. the dialog feels very real. i thought the direction was first-rate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies. not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film, so he had to do triple duty on this, writing, directing and starring. if you get a chance to see this film on itunes, it's worth the download. it'll make you laugh out loud a few times. and that's more than most shorts offer these days.

"boy next door" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. in just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. kudos to travis davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. he's the funniest nebbish since woody allen. and what a treat to see richard moll back again. if you thought all he could do was play "bull" the bailiff on "night court", think again. this gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of stephen garvey. remember that name. forget charlie kaufman, steve garvey is the true current king of quirky comedy.

i just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow nyc, or any big city of mid-century america. the colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the womens movement. it reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. in some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. inmy opinion, beautiful women will still throw themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals! the laws we have now against harrassment andall, were passed by unattractive women who wanted an equal chance tocompete with prettier women who might be getting the positions soleybased on thier looks and puting out! the real competition isn't betweenmen and women, but women and women! i liked the look and feel of the movie but the world hasn't changed asfar as what real

watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale, i was floored by joan crawford's first appearance. all i could think initially was, "my god, it's the same face as michael jackson in his notorious booking photo!" about 34 minutes into the movie, diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in greenwich village. as they walk down the street, you can see part of a sign in back of them for the stonewall bar -- scene of the epochal "riots" that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement.speaking of baker and taxis, i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie, "56th and sutton place, please -- and be careful of the bumps." can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in today's manhattan?! she says that, of course, because she's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the fetus. but that doesn't stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion! well, they had to find a way for her to lose the baby (1959 and all).sue carson is delightful as mary agnes. why was this her only movie? there is no biographical information on her in imdb.

a sincere tribute to suzy parker, who's just passed away. not only is tboe one of the cheesiest movies ever made, but miss parker's performance is, in this cheesy-movie-lover's opinion, among the worst performances of all time. her last scene is especially overplayed. i loved it!

the best of everything. just what is the best of everything? it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. but alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. this story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. but as the saying goes,"we are the captains of our own ships", and so it goes for our lives. we are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. once we make those choices then we must live with them. as we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever, we wonder, would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? who knows?

fun bad movie which should amuse. one of joan crawford's last performances as the driven successful editor vs. all those young beautiful eager beavers fresh out of the elite seven sister colleges. great '50's ambiance of new york. wonderful period costumes and hairdos. terrific art direction. trite story, but rousting tearjerker. interesting cameo by robert evans as a rich cad.

this is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy. the plot follows a young woman (hope lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. we can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor (hey, it's hollywood) and a few other flaws. here is one of the few films in which once big time producer robert evans (here, beautifully depicting a rat with women) appears. it also features a mature joan crawford and terrific supporting cast. check it out.

great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. great production design, appealing stars, great lines ("miss bender, i don't care if you beat it out on a native drum!", says joan crawford's amanda farrow to hope lange when lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). if you've seen this movie panned and scanned on tv and not in the letterboxed version on pay-tv or amc (american movie classics) you haven't really seen it. hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on dvd in a letterboxed version and with it's original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack. great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 new york while johnny mathis sings the "best of everything" theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of background screamers. miscarriages! insanity! office romance! bitchy cold-hearted bosses! thwarted love! it's all here to enjoy.

the best of everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women, hope lange, suzy parker, diane baker, and martha hyer at a new york publishing firm. what's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all.presiding over this group of young fillies is wise old mare joan crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life. she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point.around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, alfred steele died. it was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. she inherited all of his stock in pepsi cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as the best of everything was being made, she wound up the queen bee at pepsi cola. life does sometimes imitate art. so that authority as she barks out dictation and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true.in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough sledding. it's rough for lange too, but she literally makes the best of everything.what a collection of stinkers the men are in this film. the best of them, stephen boyd, is a heavy drinker. the others louis jourdan, robert evans, and brett halsey, are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film.i can't forget brian aherne either who's the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm. half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today.some nice location shots of new york in the fifties make the film a real treat. catch it by all means.

if this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. i love this. everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. i think all the minor characters are wonderful. if someone like joan crawford is over the top, it's all part of the package. if you pick out many things in the movie, it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not "take it lying down," at least not if they didn't want to. as far as characters being contradictory, for instance, suzy parker's character acting like she's all for flings, but then getting too attached to louis jourdan's character, isn't that what many people are like--contradictory? they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane baker's character finding the love of her life after miscarrying her illegitimate baby in an accident--lying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head. this is part of the package too, it's charm--glossy escapism. i like the mix of real stories pertinent today (the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men, therefore doesn't have a family when she is older) with ones that make you wish, "ah, if only i could fall in love with a doctor and he'll love me even though he knows my sordid past, and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident!!" also, i just got the dvd, widescreen, it's yet even more beautiful than full screen... yay!

claire booth luce's "the women" shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play, (and 1939 film that also has joan crawford playing a bitch: a character who might have been amanda farrow 20 years before), that has no male characters. here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are. they use women like toys and throw them away, leaving the women to suffer. ironically, the women in "the women", perhaps because they are all we see, are shown in a less than favorable light, alternately silly and scheming, with the only "nice" one, (norma shearer), growing "claws" by the end. in "the best of everything" we see the men for the cads they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable.this is a film about women leaping from things. diane baker leaps from a car, (in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history, which is not in the book). suzy parker falls from a fire escape. the women in the film are leaping into the workplace, looking for success and love at the same time. women would leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera behind in the next decade. but they would come back to it in the 80's and 90's through the novels of people like sidney sheldon and judith krantz, (although their trashier works aren't as good as this).the best thing about this film is the way it looks. i love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50's and 60's. they look so much better than the pixel-challenged home movies we've been making since, especially in the letterboxed version we see on tv, and the dvd, with the picture so clear you could walk into it. the look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable. this film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other. it has a supermodel, (suzy parker), a beauty queen, (myrna hansen, who was not miss america 1954 as rona jaffe says in the dvd commentary but rather miss usa 1953, per the imdb: but so what), and a playboy playmate, (june blair, from january 1957). my vote goes to suzy, one of the astonishing beauties of all time. her acting here isn't as awful as people pretend: they are just reacting, as people did then, to the sight of a supermodel, (the first, really), trying to act. nobody seemed to care how well she did. her role, that of an apparently worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex in the bunch and she does just fine.the most touching thing about the film now is the age of the female leads at the time. hope lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959. diane baker was 20. suzy parker was 26. hope, who looked to be grace kelly's heir, never made it really big and wound up being mrs. muir on television and, per the imdb, wound up living in a home with "crates for coffee tables" because she spent her money on causes she believed in before dying at age 72 in 2003. this film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her by then. baker, always a welcome face in 60's tv, (especially to richard kimble), and still active as an actress and acting coach, just turned 67. parker found "the best of everything" with bradford dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70 the same year lange did. but here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.

a classic late 50's film. the superannuated headliners (joan crawford and louis jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. in a 50's sense (which i love).the look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film "far from heaven" reflects exactly this sort of film (and i suspect this film may be one of the models). a silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959!), but as a film-- glorious! as a reflection of the society, extremely interesting. and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores, fascinating.

this working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate, courtesy of its immaculate physical production, 50s costuming (look at all those bows and pearls), creamy johnny mathis theme song and oh-so daring (for its time) sexual attitudes. rona jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, keeps on being republished, and just a few years ago vanity fair actually devoted an article to this delectable bon bon of a movie. take a look at the new dvd transfer and you'll know why.the three leads - hope lange, diane baker and suzy parker - echo the girls from "how to marry a millonaire" or carrie bradshaw and her friends from "sex and the city." "gentlewomen songsters off on a spree..." their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are the stuff of paperback passion: empty caramel corn calories, devoid of nutrition, impossible to resist snacking on. lange is genuinely touching in her neo-grace kelly way, baker is properly dim and idealistic as a timid virgin who gets (gasp) knocked up by a (hiss) cad. it helps that the cad is played by robert evans, the throaty voiced, coke snorting film mogul who surely has lead many an innocent young lamb to the slaughter in his beverly hills bedroom.suzy parker is fascinating in the first half of the film, all blithe self assurance and knowing remarks. she struts her stuff with the panache of the fashion icon she was in the 50s. alas, she's not up to where the film sends her: into madness and obsession. but she exudes glamour and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate. one wonders why the critics loathed her, virtually driving her out of movies a few years later. perhaps an aloof attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear. it sank ali mcgraw's career a generation later, and, when you think of it, ali mcgraw and suzy parker were basically the same actress.the film's only major flaw is a weak ending. it pretty much collapses into a romantic swoon at the end, rather than rising to a wham bang melodramatic finish, like the other famous soap opera from producer jerry wald, "peyton place," which had lana turner weeping and gnashing her teeth during a rape trial. here, hope lange wanders out onto the new york sidewalk, spots burly, eternally hung over (but now, of course, sober) stephen boyd and they simply walk off together...into the sunset, one presumes. otherwise, this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure.oh yes...there's also joan crawford, breathing fire at all the young girls and smoking cigarettes while she hisses to her married lover over the phone. and the titles are done in hot pink, with ribbon lettering that recalls the department store ads of the late 50s. don't miss!

i first saw this film in 1959 at the hoyts double bay cinema in sydney when fifteen years old. i loved it then and still do. the ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" for them in the respective roles. a "glossy" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. the soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that film score monthly released the cd in january, 2005. pity scenes were cut prior to release - even at two hours you want more! i have registered with amazon for the dvd (they do now have a special page). to view this film in cinemascope after forty six years of pan and scan will be great. twentieth century fox, please look further into your catalogers of fifties cinemascope productions for dvd - there is a large market out there. i await arrival from us of march, 2004 vanity fair special article on the film, which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set. cheers.

i feel very strongly that this film was just like waiting to exhale with white females in the 1950's. as in waiting to exhale, all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good. the only difference, besides the obvious, was that there wasn't much humor in this film. i would even say that it was tragic. only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (hope lange's guy), but even then there was conflict in this relationship.the story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success. unfortunately for them, romance didn't seem to come easy although they were young, intelligent and attractive. this movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving suzy parker's character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy.this is a must see.

this is a great horror movie. great plot. and a person with a fear of midgets will definately love the evil midget! this is a must see for any horror fan. finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a great cast! highly recommended.

i can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. to be honest, i saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. yes, i rented it after reading others' comments. they are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. they are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of dr. graves.also interesting is scott clark, who plays grant, the kid in the wheelchair. i identify with the character he played, perhaps because i am in a wheelchair.this movie is certainly worth your looking at.

"side show" is one of the weirdest horror movies ever made from full moon pictures. very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the trailer makes it out to be (the trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). also, the acting and visual effects are well done. i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, slumber party massacre, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

what a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the golden gate bridge of san francisco in this exciting action picture. although the characters and the story are in fact bad, it still has a certain cult-flair.

tex avery's tenure as director of cartoons for mgm was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. his cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie the mask. eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.this is one of several droopy cartoons that avery was responsible for and it's among his best. droopy is a mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison. throughout the film, despite many insane stunts, droopy keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because droopy is seemingly everywhere! full of funny gags and loaded with laughs, this is a great cartoon.

this animated short is a remake of one of tex avery's earlier shorts for fred quimby at m-g-m (dog gone tired). an escaped convict (here just known as joe)who just broke out of 'alka fizz prison' tries to keep one step ahead of droopy (known here as sgt.mcpoodle of the mounties),but always manages to run into him,one way or another. this is easily one of the most side splitting,funny shorts that rolled out of the m-g-m animation studio. it manages to get most of it's laughs from the shocked reactions joe has whenever he encounters mcpoodle (including some equally deranged sound effects-i.e..car horns,screaming,elephants,etc.). as with any avery m-g-m short,frantic,kinetic pacing is to be expected (along with some nice, surreal sight gags-i.e.joe trying to run away from mcpoodle & actually running off the side of the film). pop this one into your dvd player & laugh yourself silly.

come on. anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. they should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by tex avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch "huckleberry hound" episodes for 20 years straight! the takes and double-takes by the wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. tex avery should receive a posthumous academy award for this cartoon. it's the best.

these cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. the first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: "alka-fizz prison - no noose is good noose." inside the prison, the first sign we see is "welcome: have a seat." they then show an electric chair.corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. with pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it! in no time, he has criss-crossed the united states, zipped up through canada and is in the northern part of that country. it's there we see the canadian royal mounted police and, of course, our hero droopy, known here as "sgt. mcpoodle." he has the assignment of catching the at-large criminal from alka-fizz. so, with his trusty little blue horse, he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf.from that point, we get the normal story: droopy always being a step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the latter does....and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny sight gags. droopy even pops out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. there is nowhere the wolf can go - or do (plastic surgery!) to escape the intrepid "sgt. mcpoodle." nobody, by the way, in the history of cartoons perhaps has more exaggerated reactions, either, than this wolf each time he sees his nemesis! his screams, facial and body stretched out in horror each time is a big part of the sight gags. you'd think this one-joke cartoon would get monotonous but it doesn't. it's more good stuff from tex avery and the gang, just one of 24 cartoons in the "complete theatrical collection" dvd with wonderful-looking restored visuals.

"the saint takes over" stars george sanders as simon templar, aka "the saint" in this 1940 entry into the series. it also stars wendy barrie, jonathan hale and paul guilfoyle. on board ship en route to the u.s., the saint meets and tries to make time with a woman (wendy barrie) who gives him the brushoff. simon is coming to new york to help inspector fernack, now thoroughly discredited due to a gangster frame-up; $50,000 was found in his home. the gangster, rocky (roland drew), of course, was found not guilty at trial, and he and his fellow mobsters pay the bill for the frame and attorney representation - $90,000 in total. today you need that to defend yourself against a parking ticket. this was a murder rap.rocky sends his bodyguard, pearly gates (guilfoyle) to the lawyer's house to steal the $90,000 from the safe. the attorney catches him red-handed and sends him back to his boss with a message. seconds later, he's dead. rocky meets a similar fate. and on and on - who's killing this group of gangsters? the saint has to get one of them to talk so that fernack can be cleared - can he get to anyone before they're murdered? the woman he met on board ship reappears and figures prominently in the case.few actors have a way with a line like george sanders, and his dry wit, good looks, smooth voice and depth as an actor suit simon templar perfectly. paul guilfoyle provides some humor as the nervous, milk drinking pearly gates, and jonathan hale is great as the sometimes exasperated but worried sick inspector fernack. wendy barrie, who appeared in many saint episodes, is very good as the woman who captures simon's heart.very enjoyable.

the above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. as usual, simon templar ("the saint") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. he also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, paul guilfoyle as "pearly" gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool! george sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated british do-gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent b-detective series film. nothing particularly special, but a familiar and breezy product sure to please fans of the genre.

this nifty little movie demonstrates the rock-solid virtues of a time, place and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even aspire to have. the saint is a paladin with only the best motives, to say nothing of a polished vocabulary and diction. no need to turn up the volume or read the dialog. george sanders is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal. some normal! george clooney can not begin to master the scene as mr. sanders does (and does without mr. clooney's mugging).he could play a sniveler (witness the ghost and mrs. muir and rebecca) but when he was good, he was very, very good. truly, a man for all reasons and seasons.

this is a better-than-average entry in the saint series - it holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.many films from the golden age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. they date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. who nowadays asks for a highball? or wears a suit and tie everywhere? and the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. frankly, much of value is missing from those days.in any case, go with it and enjoy. it's good - in an old-fashioned sense.

excellent entry in the rko saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. george sanders is suave and witty. jonathan hale simply is inspector fernack. paul guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. he will return in a later entry in the series. story begins on an ocean liner headed to the u.s. where the saint meets but cannot connect with wendie barrie. she eventually succumbs to the saint's charms but she breaks his heart in the end. the saint assists inspector fernack clear his name from a frame. a few bodies fall along the way. good entertainment and above average for this type of film. watch it.

george sanders playing the saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script - with the usual good rko cast around. it's a non-charteris story too, bristling with murders and good clean fun.thread 1: in new york, police inspector fernack, templar's friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced - st comes over from london to try to put things right. nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $90,000 in the world? thread 2: another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother, wendy barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the saint fall in love with her to boot. including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in fernack's cellar - there's a creepy shot of him (dead and staring) and them in a car when they're taking him back to where they'd got him. paul guilfoyle as pearly gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this - witness the dressing gown at the beginning, and the later beguiling comment by st that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and did too for "palm springs"! fernack was played by jonathan hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from templar to liven him up.the hays office also made sure you got the picture right, all threads are tied up with no straggly bits. well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if val kilmer's version is your yardstick then don't bother.

i want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and i think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. it definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.i had heard of bruce haack but didn't know much about him, and i found the start of this documentary frustrating because i could hear other musicians talk about him, but bruce haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance. i wanted to see this bruce haack guy!! i felt as though the makers assumed i already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which i didn't, so i felt a bit left in the dark.when bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who bruce haack was, but it was only a taste. we got treated to more musicians and i felt as though i was being told "look - all these cool musicians are into him, so he must be cool!" i didn't really care much for the musician's commentary on bruce.i wanted to see bruce, as a person. you know, the important stuff - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. more about his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other issues. i would of liked to know so much more about his "hackula" project. i wanted to get inside his mind. even if they did this via some "voice of god" commentary and photos it would of been ok.the animations were good, but again i felt these were used as filler, they didn't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the dimension 5 records. i did think it was clever and creative, but again... i wanted to learn more about bruce! maybe bruce haack was this elusive in real life?anyway - in the end i enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as mr. haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards. i am glad that this film is around to educate people about bruce haack, even with its flaws.

i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film. i had just seen the moog doc, which was alright, the only problem was moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way. there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie. invention of the peopleodian, where bruce could actually play music by touching people. it must have been challenging to document haack's 'scatter-brained' output, which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable (even rap music), but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. and the cast... what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, tripping with kids, fighting against the music industry. i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history, it's that mainstream, but that important.

this movie was released originally as a soft "x", apparently with the explicit sex deleted. later, the producers "relented" (smelled money) and re-released it with the excised scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). i guess since kristine was of age, it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt. i guess its all in the timing (witness pam anderson's career)--but ronald reagan was in charge during kristine's debacle (we had not heard about nancy reagan's affairs), bill clinton and monica lewinski were in full swing during pam's "coming out".the sex is just icing on the cake, both version satisfy. this naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time.

i thought the movie was great. i thought kristine debell was great and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles. i even overlook the fact that the print i have wasn't quite put back together correctly. but, who cares?

i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. it was a fun romp with some cool music. kristine was on the playboy cover, and the centerfold, as i recall. she's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. the movie made me want to see more of her and so i kept a look out for her in other stuff. she's in steven spielberg's "i wanna hold your hand" and barbara streisand's "the main event" and bill murray's "meatballs", plus lots of tv shows like night court and tv movies. me and my friends really enjoy her. but her starring role in alice in wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on kristine as the center of attention, probably the prettiest, hottest girl i've ever seen in movies.

i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film. our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label. it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated (soft porn?) release version of this film, nor the unrated version (hard porn?) available on dvd were in any way pornographic.in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt. many classic books such as lady chatterley's lover, fanny hill, women in love, the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content, tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation, and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line, but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography. although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities, in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment, it cannot be regarded as pornographic (this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic, only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment). in aiw, we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing, and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do. after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland (closely based on that of lewis carrol) where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs. she is shocked, but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them, so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away. she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair, but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored, and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog - an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart.pornographic? - hardly!.suitable viewing for children? - well probably not quite, unless they have very progressive parents.r rating? - pg would be more appropriate today.entertaining for viewers in most age groups ? - yes, but the film has its faults - these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb, however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it.i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an anti-pornography activist of "scientific proof" that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models. these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic, several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format; the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film, released by subversive cinema in 2007. copies of this were readily available until a few months ago, now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price - a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing. this continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status.commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting - my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect self-censorship recommendations originating with the hayes committee. on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and i seldom make them; but fortunately i still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying. it is flawed, but kristine debell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience. overall i would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next dvd edition if and when it appears. if ms debell is still alive today i would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to suppress this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved.

wonderful movie. adult content. lots of erotic scenes plus excellent music and dance scenes. my wife and i absolutely loved this movie and wish they'd make more like it.

i finally snagged a copy of kannathil muthamittal through netflix and spent new yera's eve watching an amazing drama unfold. it began with shyama (a winsome nandita das) getting married to dhileepan in the backwaters of sri lanka and then a war takes over their romance. shyama has to flee to india and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. several years later we see amudha, a playful well-loved child (p. s. keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very how to solve a problem like maria sequence. on her birthday she is told by her parents thiru (madhavan) and indra (simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. this tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to sri lanka to try to find her birth mother. the country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. but this also leads to their meeting the new shyama - one who finally is confronted by amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.the story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that drive the birth mother, the normalcy of chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged sri lanka - mani ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. ar rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. the film has excellent performances from madhavan, nandita das, simran and an absolute stunner role as amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste p. s. keerthana. this performance won her a national award.the cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. i am intrigued by the connection mani ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. i think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl. his one liners were hilarious. the mother played by simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. the shock, angst, and obsession of the child amudha was outstandingly portrayed by p. s. keerthana. her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. in fact the enigmatic characters were those of nandita das, and her husband. perhaps mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. it also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.kannathil muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - i rarely weep in the movies, but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. this is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!

the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen "dil se" which led me down the path of buying well over 122 hindi dvds in thecourse of four months. i can say i understood the total attraction, i wassomehow confused as to why the film would stop for "music videos". it was an excellent movie, i didn't know what to make of the dancing and the femalevocals were a bit shrill for my western ears, but somehow i found ar rahmen's score hypnotic. i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan, kuch kuch hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of "ichi thekiller" a few other korean films , i can't be bothered to watch much else. kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong, horrorand action/science fiction films for the past 30 years.but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal, it is one of the mani ratman's latest efforts and i laughed, cried, got totally mad, terrified and most of all i didn't feel manipulated. the acting was superb, the photography was beautiful, i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting. the music fit the movie perfectly and after thecredits rolled, i wanted to watch again... so i did.it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop. this is what great film is all about! i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over!my wife is watching now, and i can't wait for her reaction, i can't expect it will be anything less than mine.

this movie was astonishing how good it was! the plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. at first i thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that i was dead wrong. i literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, i must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! no, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you. american or asain, i would recommend this to anyone--and i have now. i guarantee that after seeing this one, you'll get the best out of it, and its plot. i hope you feel the same, and write a rave review too!

i had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, july of 2007. i can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. the story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the civil war. i cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life. the costumes and sets were gorgeous! i thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts i and ii. part iii is a disappointment.

i own the miniseries on dvd because i love this story so much. this is one of the best period pieces on the civil war that i have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. the costumes are great, the story lines are great, i love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. there is a great balance of good and evil. some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch. every time something more despicable than the last happens i curse the tv as if they can hear me. i love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in it's drama. i would advise however not to watch the third movie in the dvd series. it's a let down compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return. i don't wish to remember how the third movie ended, i prefer to live with the thoughts of the ending in the second movie. it makes me happy.

i watched this series on tv in 1990 and absolutely loved it (i was nine years old). i bought the first dvd box about six month ago and got the second a couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). gosh...it was hard to get any sleep with all the thoughts in my head...what was gonna happen to madeline and george etc. slave issues and civil war has always fascinated me (a 25 year old finn).i advise to read slaves in the family by edward ball for those who want to take a peek in the past and try to understand what really happened.i'm not sure if i want to see heaven and hell after so many people have told here that it wasn't really that good.

i absolutely adored this movie as a child and still do as an adult. to say that is even an understatement. my sister, brother and i watched it one year at our grandparents' house during christmas vacation. they had taped it from tv. our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. not so! we became mesmerized. they could not have unglued us if they tried. it became a cherished yearly tradition. we loved everything about it: the time, the romance, the battle scenes, the villains etc.come on, who can resist hating that psycho bent with his constant sir!? classic! moreover, who can resist cheering wildly when justin falls off the balcony?! what a triumphant moment! i always had a special place in my heart for orry and madelaine. they were so romantic. the theme song alone can get me to tear up a little. this movie is incredibly moving and i challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end. it's worth it!!

i saw this movie when i was a lot younger but it captured me. i loved orry and george's relationship so much. i was so enraptured in orry and madenline's love story. i am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. i especially liked it when he first met her. i just wish he had more time with her and their baby. so you know in book three i was so hurt that he died. i didn't really understand that because they had little time together. i just loved patrick in this movie. i just bought all three books together and i can't stop watching them. my 12 year old son is stuck on it. he likes the fighting in the war. i cry every time. i wish i could meet patrick and madeline in person! it was a wonderful movie and cast!

i was 13 when this mini-series (and its sequel north and south, book ii) first aired. i had already been captivated by the personal interest stories in/around our american civil war, which is what interested me in watching this made-for-tv program.i loved it. and now i'm 29 years old and i only love it more. it is full of history, beautiful costuming, real-life characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters, all of whom you come to care deeply about. there is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and reconstruction.even though i had the full set of episodes on tapes i recorded back when it originally aired, i purchased the full set of both n&s and n&s ii from columbia house some years ago when they became available. once every few years i'll take a whole weekend and watch all the installments back to back - and am sad when the last episode rolls to an end, because i find myself wanting to continue watching the story of the lives of these characters.i cannot recommend this mini-series more highly.

this was the one movie to see about the civi war. my aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the justin and madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. the script was genuine, and accurate. the costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. i dearly love patrick swayze and james ried. they were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. the civil war is my favorite thing in american history, and i love movies about it. i have seen quite a few, and this movie and it's sequal north and south book 2 took the cake. if you haven't seen it, rent it. as soon as possible. it's quite an eduation.

a story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and most of all, friendship set in the very interesting time of the american civil war.gets you interested in history, gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episode.moreover, the casting was splendid. many superstars appear in short cameos, the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes - kirstie alley and terri garber should be mentioned here - this is simply a superb example for a tv production as it should be.not to forget the sheer loveliness of wendy kilbourne portraying constance :-)

i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie. my teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.the battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. lloyd bridges as jefferson davis and hal holbrook as abraham lincoln stand out. we all thought phillip casnoff as bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. we all thought charles stole the show from orry and george.we will enjoy the movie again!

"north & south" the television mini-series is to the 80's what "rich man, poor man" (the first-ever tv mini-series) was to the 70's.it's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author john jakes. the story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of president abraham lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the civil war - north versus south. the intertwining stories evolve around the families of the hazards (the 'north' in the title) and the mains and their two central figures of george and orry who form a friendship whilst embarking on their west point training in 1842."north & south" is a wonderful historic timeline and as i have grown older (and wiser!) it very much interests me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as 'slavery' and 'abolitionists', and how these attitudes originated.the series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in george and orry's lives, and also the women that stole their hearts as young men. this aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to the turbulent backdrop of the american civil war."north & south", along with "rich man, poor man" is overshadowed by 1977's "roots" as the greatest mini-series of all-time. however, it does come a close second/third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as "roots". but, don't let this one get away, even if it's just to see the great scenery, costumes, and brilliant all-star cast including gene kelly, johnny cash, elizabeth taylor, james stewart, olivia de havilland, lesley-anne down et al. the series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it's a pity the emmys and golden globes didn't honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals. patrick swayze and james read, the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time, turn in compelling performances as orry main and george hazard respectively. however, it's kirstie alley's riveting performance as george's 'abolitionist' sister virgilia that steals the show many times. plus, terri garber, david carradine and philip casnoff as elkanah bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate."north & south" books 1 & 2 are now available on two dvd sets.

skenbart takes place in the 1940s, right after the second world war. main character gunnar (gustav hammarsten) quits his job to get a chance to "make a difference" in the bombed-out postwar europe. he packs a book by his favourite philisopher, ludwig witgenstein, and embarks on a trip which will eventually prove witgenstein's famous statement true: nothing is what it seems.there are two main plots, and several subplots, to this film, which takes place on a train bound for berlin. writer/director peter dalle (also playing the role as the conductor of the train) has assembled an impressive cast including swedish legends lena nyman, g√∂sta ekman and robert gustafsson. overall, the acting is excellent.skenbart offers some rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and starts cursing violently). it's like killingg√§nget meets peter jackson (braindead, bad taste) in schindler's list. i laughed during most of the film, and when i woke up the next morning i laughed even more. an intelligent film for fans of swedish comedy.

`skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from peter dalle but from the swedish cinema industry itself. it is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before christmas in december 1945, which it does very well. almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to berlin. on the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'gunnar' played by the, in sweden, famous actor gustav hammarsten. the leading role 'gunnar' is the type of person that, although his intentions are for the best, seems to drag everyone near him, in a extremely funny way, into disaster and to a living hell, especially for a from the finnish war, homecoming, wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian robert gustafsson. on the train is also a doctor, who cheats on his wife, with his mistress. they have together planned to murder the doctors wife that is also travelling with the same train without any knowledge about her husbands intentions. will the wife of the doctor elude the plans to murder her and will everyone else survive the unlucky fellow 'gunnar'?

in december 1945 a train leaves the central station of stockholm for berlin. there aren't much left when it arrives. not of the train and not of some passengers.this is a black comedy directed by peter dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. the actors must have had lots of fun making it. they aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.a deadly black and deadly funny film. see it, if you didn't think the swedes were capable of humour.

the ali g show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. sasha cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... and it is very funny. so i didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. so the basic point of all show was lost. but i was wrong - i laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films i ever saw. sure it was stupid, but who cares if you can't actually brake in to safe with a car battery, like someone said? it wasn't supposed to be a realistic documentary... and it isn't like the show, it goes in totally different way, but that doesn't mean it is bad. when i finished watching i was totally impressed, but now when some time passed i realized that it was not that special anyway, but it still deserves a nine - well at least for what it is supposed to be.

i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think sacha barren cohen was very and i do mean very good. he is a genius. and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot, and make it funny at the same time!!very good film. strongly recommend!!!! (not so strongly if you are over 30)

anyone who has seen ali g before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'ali g indahouse' although i prefer ali g when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of ali g.if you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it aiiii! 7/10

the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it doesn't work in the same way.don't get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of biting, witty dialogue, that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well, whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious, if unrealistic story.one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. when i say embarrassing, i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras, but rather, you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut. one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended, to the tune of, "this is how we do it." whenever i watch the film, i stop the dvd when it says the end, and leave it at that.overall, ali g indahouse is a good film, worth watching a couple of times. the script is enjoyable to an extent, and there are no issues as far as acting goes. however, refinement is the key word here.ali g is a better television programme. borat is a better film.

very intelligent language usage of ali, which you musn't miss! in one word: (eeh sentence...) wicked, so keep it real and pass it on!

i don't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor. you need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! if this isn't your "cup of tea", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. maybe they did set out to make yet another drugs/t&a movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. it's especially funny for the ali g fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him. so i say big ups to ali g, and if it's not your thing, don't whine- batty boy!

being american, i have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. i have nothing to compare it to. i have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the american teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, i couldn't stop laughing. i hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. and usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. my only disappointment was when it was over. i'm actually going to buy this on dvd when i find it.

by convincing the prime minister to back the totally unsuitable ali g as a candidate for staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor david carlton (charles dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. to his surprise, however, the plan backfires, ali is embraced by the nation, and carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: ali g indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for sascha baron cohen's middle-class berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much more¬ómeaning it's my kind of film!!obviously, there are those who are simply not going to get the joke, and there will definitely be people who find risqu√© jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography, and the queen's nether regions offensive in the extreme (needless to say, they should stay well away!), but if you find such juvenile humour side-splittingly hilarious, are a fan of baron cohen in general, or just want to see hottie rhona mitra in her underwear (and you shud, cuz she iz well fit!), then i fully recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of ali g and the west staines massive.they iz wicked!

the thing with ali g is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. the humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.personally i totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. you can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. the humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. the humour is probably very english, and specifically london, so its possible that non-english viewers may not get some of the humour. think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it - especially if the likes of kevin & perry go large tickled you!

ali g earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. ali g indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. he has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. a human side to ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ali g running for pm is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. the film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. so why didn't i give it ten stars? well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. and in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's ali g for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. ali g's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on imdb. but it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.on the whole, ali g indahouse is hilarious british comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. a great job! 9/10

sacha baron cohen is a genius. and this movie is good! although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! i've liked ali g since the first time i saw the material from the show. i think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, peter dragon ("action") and the blues brothers. biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (dance and gambon). after this i will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. i have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. very juvenile, but hey, so what?! one more thing to mr. g: sequel, please!**** / *****

as someone who usually despises ali g, ali g indahouse was absolutely brilliant. when i was watching it, i was in a hysterical fit. yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and i loved it. as some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. i have never seen a comedy as original as ali g indahouse.for a comedy starring ali g, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. absolutely brilliant.

ali g indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films i've seen in a long time, and cohen's portrayal of a british gangsta is hilarious. this film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. ali g indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. definitely vote ali g and keep it real.

just before dawn is an underrated horror film from the early eighties. i haven't seen it in years but it had a great impact when i watched it, quite original for its day, the only problem is that it has not been released on video or dvd for years. if you like horror i urge you to check this little gem out!!

"just before dawn " is one of the best slasher films.it very realistic and atmospheric.it reminds me tobe hooper`s "the texas chainsaw massacre " and "deliverance ".deborah benson very good plays the heroine and director jeff lieberman created very creepy and dark movie."just before dawn " is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing.i neverliked slasher films or gore except with this one.very impressive and convincing movie ( at least for me )

i remember years ago bbc1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. i tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. the film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. it's one of my favorite slasher films and i have no idea where an uncut version can be found. currently deleted everywhere (except the usa where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). it's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen. wrong turn (the recent stan winston produced movie) owes a great deal to just before dawn. one of the better 80's slasher films and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.

the cover of the vhs says it all: "without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the texas chainsaw massacre". i'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and i have to say, i agree 100 %. the characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially george kennedy as the forest-ranger). there's the twisted atmosphere, that only tcm has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. this has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time! jeff lieberman as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works (blue sunshine, wrong turn) added, he must be one of the most underrated directors in the filmindustry today.

i watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the jesus out of me. i loved it so much and i was dying to get my hands on it.in 2002, i remembered that this movie existed but i had no idea what it was called, so, i went to the i need to know section on imdb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. anyway, eventually someone on imdb told me, so i researched and tried to buy the movie. so eventually i got a hold of it on dvd, and i now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. i really love it, and i think anyone who watches it, will be very scared in the woods the next time they go. 9/10.

"when i die, someone will bury me. and if they don't, what's the difference. who gives a damn, huh?" thus the philosophy of life (or lack there of) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of sergio leone's "dollars trilogy."in the opening scene, three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and, with menacing glares, they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leone's for a few dollars more. there is one guy in eastwood's poncho, one in lee van cleef's black suit, and one seeming to act like gian marie volonte's indio. but this movie is not about these guys. no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger.no. this is an altogether different story.in an obvious copying of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly, three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure. once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit. the stranger (george hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest. he is after the reward for the bandit monetero (gilbert roland). but when monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.to round off the trio there is edd byrne's corrupt bank executive, clayton. he too wants the money for himself. but after the money is hidden away, the only man who knows where it is gets shot. now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does. and any gun can play.with plenty of gunfights, fist fights, and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff, a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good, the bad, and the ugly -- but with a twist.this movie is not as good as leone's films, of course, but in the end who gives a damn, huh? this movie is fun -- 60s nihilism, spaghetti western style. there are no rules, no enduring loyalties, and no right or wrong -- just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. and, though the movie is not classic, the ending surely is. hey, maybe we all can get along after all, for a hundred thousand a piece.if you like spaghetti westerns, check this one out. it is fast, furious, and worth the look.

hallelujah!!!! ¬Öfinally, a true colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how bogot√° and colombia really are! i am an american of colombian and french heritage sick and tired of seeing colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by hollywood and others.how many of you are aware that colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the usa), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of ugly betty), that it's capital, bogota (pop. 9 million) is the "world capital of the book," or that this beautiful city is host to the world's largest international theatre festival? i hope that doug liman, simon kinberg (-mr. & mrs. smith), robert zemeckis, diane thomas (romancing the stone) one day visit bogot√°, to see how wonderful it really is, and focus on bogot√°'s cultural vitality and diversity, instead of myopically producing films such as maria full of grace from which joshua marston profited greatly (for this terrific film) without ever thinking-through about the ontological damage his film would help to perpetuate upon the "unfairly tarnished image" of colombia.-anyway, you will at least enjoy bluff very much! -oh, and thanks imdb for your invaluable/great work!!!

this film is one to spend the short while, entertainment, but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything identifies "the colombian". who looks for the topics of the supposed colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is denominated "it jeopardize",it is better than it is not going to see this film. some to the drug traffic, or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker, or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political. the corrupt police is a personage who it could be mexican, russian, italian or chinese, and also the personage protagonist, an argentine photographer, it could be venezuelan, peruvian or philippine and the frequent "boludo" in its parliaments it could be replaced by another word of slang of any other country without the personage or history changes. the important thing is that it is a very decently counted history with images and right performances. its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones. that if one film like this if it deserves or does not deserve the support with publics bottoms a little is a classic discussion "mamerta".

'bluff' has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in bogota, and today i finally got round to seeing it. i didn't really know what to expect at all, but was very happily surprised. it is a crime comedy of the same ilk as snatch etc, and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy. the style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the argentinean narrator who makes asides direct to camera -- odd the first time, but subsequently fitting naturally.with my less-than-perfect spanish, i still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow, and plenty of the comedy is situational. my colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different regions and social classes which did pass me by somewhat, but for instance a well-acted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language.i think it is to this film's credit that it has something of a global flavour: i wasn't often reminded that this was colombia that i was watching. yet it is important to note that many wealthy bogotanos do live like some of the characters in this film, and it is not a mis-portrayal of bogota or colombian society in any way, just a *selective* portrayal -- as is any film supposedly portraying a 'real' situation/culture.i don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles, but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out: it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour. and all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes.

bluff i really think this movie is very good.is basic a different kind of colombian movie. is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.it shows a different face o bogot√° and i think that's very important because colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director felipe martinez and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.we need to continue support colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.

i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. and amazingly i found it really original. i have commented on other colombian films before, and i agree that colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. but let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. unfortunately, this is how real people speak. the storyline and the pacing are brilliant, and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world the acting was great, and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in colombian soil. i think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy. it kind of reminded me of films like snatch, and others of the sort. i highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people, since colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.

i'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. and... wouah! the pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie abbyss ? anyway, it's remarkable. sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on tv, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. the only downside is the commentary. in french it's narrated by fran√ßois perrin, usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries, but the text is not good at all. not enough informative of too much, innapropriatly anthropoid...

words can hardly describe what blue planet brought to life in all of its hours of runtime. matching up with walking with dinosaurs, this documentary stands as one of the best. we can only pray that the bbc and discovery channel come up with even more outstanding ideas that could possibly even level with this one.

i think that this short tv series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. this was by far david attenborough at his best. i personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. this is definitely worth peoples money!i also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. it was incredible to find out that the 'blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! in this documentary attemborough almost certainly lived up to his high reputation. this was a masterpiece and will always be considered to be one of the best modern documentaries many congratulation's to the 'blue planet' team.

full of surprises, beautiful, cruel at times. just like life itself. leaves one asking for more. the best parts are of course the action scenes and chases. have to really wonder how much work these guys put into making some scenes (whale chases, polar bear hunts, etc). it is a wonderful experience and not to be missed by anyone who dives, surfs, or goes to the beach once in a while. the music is enticing and the narration is superb and extremely well paced. definitively one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than a very respectable 10 (for its kind). some of the footage is very cruel and might not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (every killer whale footage is cruel).

the blue planet series is, without a doubt, one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean. for five years, filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series, getting footage that has never been seen by anyone (i.e. in the title, the deep.) i highly recommend you watch this series. to see the angler fish outside of the small pictures shown in textbooks is truly a treat, but only a needle in the vast haystack of the sea that blue planet covers. from the open ocean to tidal pools, coral seas to the deepest darkest part of the ocean itself, the bbc takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the ocean. i have to admit, one of my earliest dreams in life was to be a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. i have studied the oceans of this world for years, and have seen countless documentaries on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. but in all, no one has managed to capture the life beneath the waves quite as well as this group of people.watch the 'blue planet' series in it's entirety, i promise you won't regret it.

this series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. i did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.david attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery. if you get the opportunity try not to watch a translated version of this series.a definite must-see for anyone interested in the intricacies of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject i've ever seen.

this is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary i have ever seen! the images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. on top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. i'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. you'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching tv! this series is available to buy on dvd and i highly recommend picking this one up! with all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving.

i absolutely adore this movie! i had never heard of it when i saw it at the video store. i saw kathy bates was in it, so i figured it had to have some worth, you know? i watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? then it was the last scene and i found myself aching from smiling so hard. i clicked "play movie" and watched the whole thing again. it is without doubt the quirkiest movie i've ever seen. but the more i watch it, the more i love it. it's absurd and crazy and sweet and dear. kathy bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is fabulous, too. what odd characters they all are! the midget is just too funny for words. and julie andrews and barry manilow are hysterical. it's just an all around funny, fabulous movie. i get cravings to see it again. whoever is watching it for the first time, please stick it out to the end. it's well worth it!

wish it would be released, as i would love to see the finished product! we saw the unfinished version before it came out. loved all the characters and actors. anyone know if it is out on video yet? would love to see it again.definitely worth renting if it's not going to be shown in the theatre. i had a hard time finding it because they renamed it.

this is one of the oddest movies i have watched in a long while. usually if they are this strange i bail out early and rarely regret it. luckily, i held on for this one. while i can't say that this is a great movie (it isn't), i can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip - only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with "did i really just see that?" wonderment. lots of laugh out loud moments. a great cast of characters with meredith eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughter-in-law with an attitude. keep an open mind.

i also joined imdb for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but so that i can sing its praises. i had never heard of this movie (it's packaged so horribly that it's easy to see why it may get passed over) but a good friend suggested it to me and i'm so glad she did. it's a gem of a film. the actors are great (kathy bates and meredith eaton in particular) and look like they are truly having a fun time. sure at times it was a bit over the top, but i cannot remember the last time i laughed so hard or so many times over the course of two hours. if you love to laugh, then you owe it to yourself to see this film.highly recommended.

i quote below words from my favor writer, paulo coelho, as the comment for this movie." when you really want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"it is too easy to forget who we really are and what we desire to do in life. because there are always too many comments and advice surrounding us to tell safety. i had almost forgot what the passion feel like. despite of the adventure will take me out of safety zone, i truely believe the fear is just the price that i need to pay for the coming brand new journey in life.thanks for inspiring me with this lovely story. it is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. that is the most treasurable love from the light of soul.

when i first bought this movie, i had my doubts about it, even though the cast was pretty impressive. but after seeing it, i really do not regret spending the money. in fact, i'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this.... an absurd combination of humor, drama, thrill and the big questions. this is exactly what makes it a great movie. okay, some might not enjoy what they see, and some might even turn it off after a little while. your loss. it's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other, and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie, turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while. for anyone with an open mind, and a sense of humor and living - watch this movie, i promise you you won't be disappointed!

what an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in north texas. kathy bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing. it is obvious that we as a general public are being force-fed that which has been deemed "great and wonderful" by the powerful and influential while true gems such as "unconditional love" manage to shine thru all those pretenders to really enjoyable cinema. rent or buy this movie.....you won't regret it!

this movie is the most moving and funny movie i've seen in a very long time. as a housewife ( "homemaker") and a fan ( rupert) i found it to be sympathetic . anyone who misinterprets dirk's angry outburst has it wrong. kathy bates is not really an actress i know but she is perfect , the whole cast is perfect for their roles. julie andrews had me in stitches .i am watching it after reading rupert's auto-biography so the inclusion of her was even more fun. it is at times terribly moving .i am not really a fan of the type of music in the film but you get drawn in to the romance and find you are singing the songs for days .this movie deserves to be more widely available .our favourite scene involves dirk and a gun and his trousers , watch it and see !

i first saw this movie in a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether i needed help - i was still sitting, crying like a maniac. the movie is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's over the top, it's gay - but it is amazing. i do think that every character is plausible. everett's character is mean to a woman who only tries to help, he brutally throws his (terrible) friends out, he does have a temper, he can harm a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life, doubly so. bates is a miracle, she is perfect, just like a role. a woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love. i even understand max (the husband), he is bored with his life, he's got a midlife crisis. he moves out, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realise a) that he's the really boring part in the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. i love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because i think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. for in the end he's her husband and he might not be as exciting as victor but he's real, he is the man she loves in a very down to earth way. i've watched it about 50 times and i do love this film, everything about it unconditionally. btw, just read rupert everett's autobiography and ul is the only film that he talks of as one of the best films he ever made. to me it's the best film he ever made.

man, i had my doubts. i love kathy bates, but i thought, how good can this be, i had never even heard of this thing...! you know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks" and we were locked in from the get-go. this is a very winsome, fun movie. it's quirky, you know? i mean, you've got a lounge singer, a murderer (and a believable one), you have farce, then kathy bates in all her acting splendor, rupert everett finally acting to his real potential, dan ackroyd, and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud. i tell ya, you'll laugh/you'll cry. maybe i had a weird week, but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes. if you don't like that movie, maybe you won't like this, but i think it was a great movie. i went out and bought the dvd.

unconditional love is one of the best movies i've seen in a while. it's an emotional roller-coaster. one of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. when dirk tells grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. when the old woman holds her glass up and says 'to the memory of victor fox and the whole pub follows suit, i wanted to cry. the funeral scene is hysterical! julie does it in her typical julie andrews style. johnathan pryce is excellent as victor. grace is one of kathy bates' best roles. meredith eaton steals just about every scene that she is in. rupert everett does some of his finest work in unconditional as dirk. the kiss between rupert and meredith took me to another bout of hysterics. in this day and age of gay rights being questioned, i think this movie should be seen by all. as a gay man in my late 40's i have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. so kudo's to all involved in the making of this film.

this is a truly heartwarming film not just about love, but about learning about yourself and your values in life. though the story is a novel starting point for a film, it is easily recognized by most people. it combines a wicked sense of humor with a subtle assault on homophobia. not to be missed.

we loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- not your usual hollywood drivel.my husband had a blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent hollywood stuff. he was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. there was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the dvd that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. but it was worth it. cathy bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. and she can sing too! if only hollywood would learn from independent film makers! maybe we would go back to the real movies. but for now, we're sticking with off beat and really entertaining films like this one! other examples we've enjoyed include: a box full of moonlight, pieces of april, delivering milo, the celestine prophesy. most of the ones by christopher guest such as: best in show, for your consideration, a mighty wind, and waiting for guffman

i wonder why i haven't heard of this movie before. it's truly a magnificent comedy (i'd say farce, but it's too well acted and i'd hate to denigrate it's quality). a comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs kathy bates and rupert everett to a wonderful effect. forget julia roberts and rupert; kathy bates and rupert should do another movie together. the anxiety-ridden, acerbic and outrageous daughter-in-law, maudie (meredith eaton), is a truly wonderful character. if you liked the tales of the city films, you'd like this quirky charmer.

minor spoilersin chicago, grace beasley (kathy bates) is a housewife having a twenty-five years marriage with the lawyer max beasley (dan aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter-in-law, maudey (meredith eaton). grace worships the singer victor fox (jonathan price), who will present a tv show in chicago and will give five spots on the first row in a tv promotion. kate calls the show and wins a ticket, when max simultaneously asks for the divorce, claiming that their lives are too monotonous. grace becomes depressed, and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a chicago serial killer, who uses a crossbow, killed victor fox. with a broken heart, she decides to fly to england to victor fox's funeral. there, she realizes that he was gay, and becomes friend of his former mate dirk simpson (rupert everett). they fly back to chicago, trying to find the killer. this movie is a delightful, original and weird dramatic comedy, having bizarre characters. it has a huge potential to be a cult-movie, with the presences of julie andrews and barry manilow themselves and a joke with nicolas roeg's masterpiece 'don't look now', when maudey wears a red raincoat in chicago's underground part of the city. the beginning of the movie, with jonathan price singing 'hitchcock railway', is wonderful. i have repeated it four consecutive times. the cast has a magnificent performance, highlighting kathy bates, jonathan price, rupert everett and the unknown meredith eaton. indeed, this movie is an excellent entertainment. my vote is eight.title (brazil): 'amor a toda prova' ('love to the proof')

i am a huge rupert everett fan. i adore kathy bates so when i saw it available i decided to check it out. the synopsis didn't really tell you much. in parts it was silly , touching and in others some parts were down right hysterical.any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character. (of course there are many they won't, but that is the point)if you like any of the actors give it a watch but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun.i might also mention you can see how darn tall rupert is. i mean i knew he was 6'4" but he seems even more in this film. he even seemed to stoop a bit due to the other characters height in this. he is tall! i mean tall!!!! and for you rupert fans there is a bare chest scene...wonderful!

"unconditional love" starts with great promise. as directed by p. j. hogan, the film works great up until the last third of the movie, when it falls flat on its face. the screen play mr. hogan and jocelyn moorehouse wrote showed a myriad of possibilities that fizzle at the end. it appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently. the reality is this is a film that is looking in different directions in how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails. don't get me wrong, the movie is tremendously appealing and will resonate with a lot of its viewing public.based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. the tremendously talented kathy bates is the perfect choice to play grace beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage. ms. bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better, even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film.rupert everett is always dependable into delivering. his role, as the late victor fox's lover is well written, that is, until dirk is lured into coming to chicago to find victor's murderer. it's bizarre and it defies all rules of logic. dirk doesn't look capable of hurting a fly, let alone hunt down a killer with the help of grace and her daughter-in-law, the incredible funny, maudey.as played by meredith eaton, this little woman, maudey, is one of the best things in the film. she's is brash and tells it as she sees it. peter sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in films these days has nothing to do in the picture; he is totally wasted. dan aykroyd also has nothing to do. we see him at the beginning and at the end of the film and his max doesn't make sense. he appears to want changes in his life and his marriage, only to come back to grace without any explanation, all things forgiven.the english actors are good. lynn redgrave has a better opportunity as the hysterical nola. jonathan pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs. julie andrews makes a funny contribution in a couple of priceless scenes. ultimately the television show hosted by sally jesse raphael is a turn off and doesn't add anything to the movie. the best part is hearing kathy bates singing. what a beautiful voice she has! in fact, ms. bates is the best excuse for staying until the end.

but a great cast! jonathan pryce, kathy bates, rupert everett, lynne redgrave, julie andrews and dan aykroyd! and that's just the beginning.i'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. oh, and a psychotic. and barry manilow.you will have to trust me when i say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your dna makeup. it's not your fault; it's hereditary. the other 50% of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you have to keep watching.even at that, at the end you may wonder why you watched... but keep in mind that absurdity thing. it should grow on you. it is a test.

what a shame this movie was never released. (it is now playing on cable.) i tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones i've been paying to see in theatres recently. i like to be surprised. so often movies are marketed as "offbeat," but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. this movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. jonathan pryce sings like an angel. even though he is required by the plot to sing some of the most mawkishly sentimental songs ever written, he does them so well one doesn't mind. cathy bates and rupert everett are well-cast and superb, but a newcomer in the role of cathy bates' daughter-in-law steals every scene she is in. give this film a chance.

my husband and i both loved this film. at first my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting through this one. but after a few key scenes he was totally sucked in and by the end he was convinced it was one of the best movies going. kathleen bates has never been so wonderfully loveable and the rest of the cast is just simply fantastic. thank you for this beautiful film.

i found this movie to be extremely delightful.i am biased i suppose.i happen to adore kathy bates.i found her singing an added pleasure.she has a very nice voice.ms bates plays grace beasley.the film takes you from her doledrums married life in chicago to england,the home of her recently murdered singing idol victor fox.there she meets his three surviving uppity sisters.she also discovers that victor leaves behind a male lover,dirk simpson.the story leads you on to some surprisingly comedic and heartwarming situations as grace and dirk develop a true fondness for each other,after an initial rather rude rejection,on his part.they return to chicago where they team up with grace's pint-sized,hilarious daughter-in-law,maudie,to find the serial killer who murdered victor.everyone in the picture did a fine job.particularly enjoyed julie andrews,lynn redgrave and barry manilow.this movie was fun.it makes you cry.the music is absolutely charming.other posters here who found problems with any parts of this movie,just don't have a clue.

you know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. well, not this time. unconditional love has it all. barry manilow and a dwarf in a movie with cathy bates as the romantic lead...and it works. not only does it work, it works very very well. in fact, i think it's perfect. i laughed so hard i think i hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. but isn't that where great comedies come from? don't characters need real feelings, real emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? well, they do in this movie. unconditional love is a movie you shouldn't miss, especially if you need a seriously good laugh, or you're at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.

without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...tv movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is "no one to blame here".i disagree. yes, the young male lover of beverly d'angelo, played by rob estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. ok, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her, but i don't buy it. people have to take responsibility for their actions. not only did he "cross the line" by having sex with a very vulnerable teen, when he was supposedly "the responsible adult",he said, "your mom must never know about this." how responsible was he then? yes, it's a good flick, but he got what was coming to him. don't kid yourselves folks that what happened was "no one's fault".

jenny lewis plays an awkward girl called jade. she smokes and drinks. she doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(beverly d'angelo). jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend billy(rob estes), maybe she is attracted to him. of course, i don't need to tell you what happens after that. this is probably my favorite tv movie. this movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. this movie also has the best acting that i have seen in tv movies. beverly d'angelo does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but neglectful and blind mother. she couldn't see what was going on under her own roof. rob estes is at his best here as the sleazeball. jenny lewis is the standout. she seems to be exactly like her character.everyone seems to love this movie!

to start off, this happens to be my favorite of the st os.in addition to stuoz's critical comments i'll throw in some more: getting technical, when the enterprise fires it's photon torps at a blind target, they'd have to be mighty close to direct hits (i believe) in order to cause any disturbance much less damage to the romulan vessel with the vacuum of space to contend with.i had somewhat of a problem with the romulan commander questioning his faith in the romulan "protocol" or their leadership, unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone) that are not at war. also, i don't think commander would fall for the basic, or simple tactics that kirk played, such as "playing dead," or falling for the ploy that the subordinate puts on him about whether or not to attack the enterprise when it is playing dead.on the enterprise: i'm surprised that after seeing the romulan vessel's method of attack earlier, that sulu would say, "are they surrendering?" when it attacks the enterprise the first time.funny how spock can only get the repair done on the weapons control right when the emergency is over.also in the final attack, i thought the romulan vessel was uncloaked too long (so long that spock could run down a couple aisles and back to the weapons room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes. i would have used phasers at this point, but i'm sure it had to do with the technicians and budget).on the positive side: it's a good drama played on the romulan vessel, in which to introduce us to the romulans. great scenes with stiles telling a good deal of the human knowledge of the romulans. also his conflict with spock is right up there. i wished stiles' character would have stayed on the show for a while, if for nothing else than the energy he added.it's only in fun that i point out the negatives and goofs, (i'm sure there are more). but for me this is as good as it gets!! "balance of terror" is always the one i place at the top in my st rankings.

i just thought i would add another observation, here. while there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between jim kirk and yeoman janice rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. when the enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal romulan plasma ball, janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer. i thought it was sweet (and janice, of course, is gorgeous!).(p.s. goof:- several times, while supposedly firing phasors, the film shows photon torpedoes being launched)

undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, balance of terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the us and the soviet union during the cold war), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of star trek's second most important hostile alien race after the klingons: the romulans. after receiving a distress call from a federation outpost, the enterprise is dangerously close to the neutral zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh. soon enough, a romulan vessel appears, carrying a new weapon and a cloaking device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat. facing the threat of imminent annihilation, kirk must engage in a battle of wits with the romulan commander (mark lenard) to ensure the survival of his crew. unfortunately, the task is made more difficult when one of the men accuses spock of being in league with the enemy, due to the physical resemblance between romulans and vulcans, two races that are, in fact, distantly related (a fact that is quite ironic with hindsight, given lenard went on to play spock's father sarek starting with season 2).always very critical when it came to the subject of war, star trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and tense take on the topic. although the romulans aren't actually based on the soviets (the name is actually taken from romulus, the founder of rome), the scenario is quite obviously inspired by the very vivid fear american and russian citizens had at the time that either nation might be able to destroy the other with nuclear weapons (that fear gave birth to the titular concept of "balance of terror"). but even without the subtext, this remains an essential episode, due for the most part to the intellectual battle between the two adversaries, which translates into a thesping duel between shatner and lenard. no need to say who wins...

i didn't realize just how much of this episode was taken from the enemy below until i finally saw the movie (it has since become my fave war flick). there were a couple of elements lifted from run silent run deep as well. nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something cool with them. and boy did roddenberry and company do something cool with this one.the story begins when the romulans violate a 100-year old treaty and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of federation outposts along the zone, ostensibly to test their superior weaponry and invisibility screen (and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the romulans and the federation, in their view) as a prelude to an all-out invasion. kirk has to decide whether it's worth risking war to try and stop the romulan ship, or if in fact the greater risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 military outposts. kirk wisely chooses the latter.this is our first look at an enemy of the federation, the romulans, a warlike, yet in their own way honorable race who are distant relatives to the vulcans. however, unlike their peaceful cousins, the romulans did not renounce their emotions and violent and imperialistic ways, even as they advanced technologically.none of this matters to mr. stiles, the ship's navigator and this episode's chief antagonist on board the enterprise (the romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer). all that matters to him is he hates romulans and spock looks like one..until the end when spock saves his life (naturally). this contrasts sharply with captain kirk and the romulan commander, neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all. both men are simply doing their duty. in fact there's a mutual respect. this is the first trek episode to deal directly with prejudice, and it does so deftly (as opposed to season 3's not-so-subtle "let that be your last battlefield").like the enemy below, we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very much alike. you see right away that both of these captains are good..very good. if you were going into battle you'd want either of these man as your leader. both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound. yet even though the romulan commander is bound by duty to his home world, he still finds himself wishing for destruction before he can make it home rather than start another interstellar war. yet he still does everything he can to make it home, just as kirk does everything he can to stop him.this is, in my opinion, one of trek's 5 best. it has everything: plenty of action, suspense, great dialogue, fine acting (i still maintain the romulan commander was mark lenard's best trek role), and it manages to make its social commentary without being overly preachy. a pity roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did tng.watch this episode, then watch the enemy below.

spoilersi love the simpsons, and i have seen every single episode that had ever come out. i must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.the episode begins with the family playing a game of scrabble to get bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. he says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. he spells out a word that angers homer and he chases bart around the house. the next day mrs. krabappel reassures the class that the test isn't part of their grade, just a test that would tell them what their future would be like. bart can't answer one question. he thinks fast. he quickly switches test with martin prince, the smartest one in class. later that day marge and homer are called to go to the principal's office to discuss bart's behavior. suddenly, out of nowhere, the school psychologist comes and tells skinner and homer and marge that bart is a genius and should go to a special school for the gifted. bart agrees to go since he wouldn't need to do any homework. the next day homer drives bart to the new school. he is introduced to everyone and everything. unluckily, his day isn't very good. the smart students take his lunch smartly, he can't read any comic books, but he does anyway, and he is criticized by his fellow students. luckily for bart, he and homer start to have a great time together, but marge bought tickets to an opera. they go to the opera, and make fun of it. the next day he goes to his old school but is made fun of by his friends. they call him a point dexter. while at his new school, bart is told to do a chemistry experiment. he does it wrong and blows up the school, leaving himself green. bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it. instead, bart tells him he wants to go undercover and go back to his old school to observe other kids. the psychologist is intrigued and he asks bart to explain it on a piece of paper. he finds it too hard and instead writes a confession that he really isn't a genius. he gives it to the psychologist. all he cares about is that he spelled the word confession wrong. that night homer bathes bart and bart tells him that he really isn't a genius and that he cheated on the test. homer gets angry and chases bart around the house as lisa and marge look at them casually.overall, this is a very underrated season one episode.8/10

the simpsons of course started off with christmas special "simpson's roasting on an open fire" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to bart mending his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates. the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out. overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the character's exactly as they became 20 years later. so watch this episode in a pack of season 1 and enjoy early simpson's doing what it was meant to, making people laugh. i rate this episode 73%.

bart the genius whilst not the first simpsons episode, bart he genius more or less is the first typical episode. there's no gimmickry or theme it's just your typical simpsons episode in set-up. it always seems to me that it's an episode that grows on you. there are certain elements i don't care for, largely the blotchy animation which can be forgiven. but over time i take a liking to this story of it's uniqueness.for example, it'd be very hard for a live-action sit-com on a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets that show in this episode, the computer bays in ms. melon's class, the opera and so on. my point is with that, the simpsons realises one of the biggest strengths in animation. the sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to live-action.on a writing stand-point it's also highly intelligent and fresh. the concept is pretty unique, and particularly the problems faced. instead of the ol' fail-safe that work was too hard, it was simply bart's social isolation from his classmates that failed him (although the exploding science experiment may prove otherwise...which i also think is one of the best visual gags of the series.) the ending seems a little unoriginal, largely because the bart running naked into his room to avoid homer was already done in the shorts, but still funny for marge and lisa's short back-and-forth if for nothing else.ultimately it's a very good episode, with lots of interesting new point in the series, though not exactly perfect.oh, and the now iconic name kwijybo was of course unleashed onto the world.

the animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode, simpsons roasting on an open fire, but already, with this first regular episode, bart the genius, the humor is beginning to be more "layered", quicker and greater depth of characterization is already appearing.this episode firmly establishes bart's "slacker" personality, and more subtly, lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. although that's the main theme of the whole episode (there's also a nice secondary theme of bart and homer's father/son relationship), it's given to us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with the simpsons playing scrabble. lisa comes up with "id" for her word--short, but something you have to be well educated to know. she has to read the definition to the rest of the family from the dictionary, which has been serving as a way to prop up the couch. marge can only come up with "he". homer has "oxidize" already sitting on his tray in order, but doesn't recognize that it's a word, so he presents "do" instead. bart comes up with "kwyjibo", which he insists is a word. similarly, in the main plot line of the episode, bart cheats on his iq test, which leads to his being put into a special school full of gifted kids. we know that's not likely to last long."the simpsons" has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through its characters, and more importantly, they way that people with vary degrees of intellectual abilities fit into (or not), are accepted (or not) and are perceived in society. aside from beginning to present bart, lisa, homer and marge's place in this context, this episode already starts respectfully poking fun at nerds and geeks outside of the simpsons family. via some of the dialogue from the students at the special school, as well as some of the other references, including purely visual ones, this episode also shows that "the simpsons" isn't going to pull any punches by means of writing or talking down to its audience. it may be just a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks and nerds are going to understand more than anyone else. and that fact, aside from it just being a very funny show, is the key to the show's longevity.

frank langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! i love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! in my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen! i adored him in "dracula" ( along with a lot of other girls out there) and in "god created woman","house of d","jason and the argonauts" and many more. i thought he was genius!!!!!! can't wait to see him in "good night and good luck"

by tynesha mells. in this drama, ja rule, who stars as reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. his old friend j-bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps reggie find who murdered his father. a week after his dad died, a preacher, reverend packer, came up dead. reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? did reggie kill reverend packer or was it some type of a setup? back in the day also has a couple of romantic scenes. see, reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and j-bone doesn't approve of his love fiend. as j-bone tries to destroy what they have, reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. but what j-bone is doing, does it work? do reggie and his girlfriend break up, or does it bring them closer together? i like this movie because it leaves you wondering what's going to happen next and did this or that happen. i like movies with suspense! it kind of makes you want to be in the movie so that you could detect things. i also like this movie because everything falls in place, if you really pay attention to it!

i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. i was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.i will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out. frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction. i could not do that with this film.i would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre.

"back in the day" is an interesting, but flawed effort. ja rule stars as reggie cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. he meets his old friend j-bone (ving rhames) who tries to force reggie into a life of crime. reggie also falls in love with alica (tatyana ali) who is the preacher's daughter. now he has to choose: love or crime.ja rule does a competent job as reggie. at least he's trying to act. ving rhames is perfect as j-bone. he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role. joe morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he doesn't do much. the same problem for giancarlo esposito as reggie's dad. he needed more screen time. i don't want to say this, but pam grier is pretty awful as mrs. cooper. she overacts every scene and brings the movie down. tia carrere and frank langella are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot.in the end: you should see it for the skilled performances of ving rhames and joe morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing.

i saw borderline several years ago on amc. i've been looking for it ever since. it was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. this movie took me somewhere like a dream and i didn't care where. i will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. i still remember the way it made me tilt my head. i remember my facial expression when i saw it. i didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but i find life is that way. it didn't bother me. the unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real. i loved the faces, the way the camera dwelt upon them. the camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a daydreamer. borderline was real to me in a way movies aren't. it was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. i love this movie. someday i will own it.

this is the ultimate of horror movies this year. "house of wax" is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen. this version really puts the vincent price version of the movie to shame. i only know a few of the young cast in the movie. the ever troublesome paris hilton; the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever. at least, she didn't try to copy her infamy. well if she likes to do horror, she's better than "wheel of fortune's" vanna white. she beats vanna hands down! and the scene of where "house of wax" was made was no joke. the house was made of wax, and the victims were able to get out of there before the get waxed like their friends. those two twins bo and vincent(the deformed twins) were maniacs from the get-go. the parents raised them well, except for vincent. and i think they became equally warped. how come the the one in the other pick-up happen to be creepy, but not as bad as the other two. that's another story in the book. i guess he had to follow his heart, and not the other twins who turned ambrose into a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. this movie is like "the phantom of the opera" meets "the rocky horror picture show". and this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005! rating 4 out of 5 stars.

i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car "to get stripped" deserves whatever happens to them.the guy, wade who "went to a barbershop and asked for the he-man haircut" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. that's a little too high-maintenance for me. also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks "like elton john only gayer," but that whole plot goes nowhere! blake was hot,i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend, who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig (no chihuahaua in her handbag,though but that would have been really precious). i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways. nick the car thief is the sexiest! one of the best parts is where a football lands by him, and instead of throwing it back, he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football. see, that's just the kind of guy he is. he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife-beater. her bra straps are showing for, like 1/2 the movie!mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this.

people are stupid.you shouldn't cheer when paris gets killed in the head with a pipe! it is plain rude!what did paris do to you? what if that was you? you wouldn't want people cheering for your death!anyway it was really gory, which i liked and it was cool when elisha's finger gets cut off.it was weird with that twist that they didn't have 2 sons they had tree and all, it makes way for a house of wax 2: ressurction or something.paris was great acting in the chase scene.elisha and chad chemistry is great, they deserve an oscar.my friends and i were cracking up when that guy said that's hot when paris and the guy from cousin skeeter making out.lol.k bye.

i saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadn't been sitting by my father. my father saw the original (unfortunately, i have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. he kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. the thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. in every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted. if they weren't in the movie, well, you might not really like it too much. the trademark characters are:"the lead character": carly (elisha cuthbert) "the lead character's boyfriend": wade (jared padalecki) "the lead character's sibling/(soon-to-be)reformed jerk": nick (chad michael murray) "the annoying sluttish character": paige (paris hilton) "characters who are just around to look pretty": dalton (jon abrahams) & blake (robert ri'chard)with those characters, it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live. obviously, you know who will with what i just typed. the movie may be predictable (in fact, i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer), but it was still enjoyable. it may seem stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted camp-site that wasn't there in the beginning?) at times, but it is very easy to watch. the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weak-stomached movie-goers it does get gory, don't get me wrong, (less than "final destination 2) but it works very well. so in conclusion, this movie wasn't as hot as the fire the set went up in, but the temperature could still burn the "wax".

ok so paris hilton sucks in it (typical malibu barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! i watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. chad michael murray is sooooooooooooooooooo hottttttttttttttttttttt and he's just a ace actor. total hero man. the main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. thumbs up. i think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax! i totally got creepers out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real. i still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment, i am just waiting to get the dvd then watch it all over again. thumbs up to such a great film! 11/10. all those people who don't like it, please don't bother 2 criticise my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so. also i think the paris scene when she strips to her underwear is totally inconvenient. why not just get a dog shagging some cat.. be more entertaining then that. when paris death scene came up, i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot. hmm.. interesting. !chad all the way!

this was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore which made it great, i would see it 1,000 more times, and paris hilton, d*mn she fine in that movie. but anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) adults like it to. you would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, it is awesome, i cant stop bragging about it. ever sine augest when i heard about it i bragged and bragged and in school i gave out flyer's saying may 6 house of wax see it. i got my whole school into it. but anyway, i would definitely saysee it may 6 house of wax, be there it be slayed.

this is one of the best horror / suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill, thrills, and yes a lot of gore!! house of wax sure delivers!!! in parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,i have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... i myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way!

i usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. house of wax was by far the best horror film i have seen... even better than the amityville horror.paris hilton was quite good in this and i must say, has a good future ahead. her death scene was probably the coolest. i'll just say how she dies...she gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. gory, eh? brian van holt was very good as both the killers, bo and vincent (vincent had the long hair). usually he plays a mean cop or soldier, but he did very well in this.eliza cuthbert and chad michael murray also acted very well as carly and nick jones. nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off, ripping her lips apart after they got glued together, and getting a straight forward punch in the face by bo.overall, i give this movie an 8/10. fans of horror films must see this.

probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - paris hilton's! after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck, paige starts to run. well, speed walk is more respectable. she finds this like garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the killers cuts her ankle from below (this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike)so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car. the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead.. i've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life.2. paige's boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him (while hes on the ground) and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat.. then he dies.3. elisha cuthbert (carly)(one of the hottest chicks ever) doesn't die phew but she does get her lips super-glued together, punched in the face, and gets part of her index finger chopped off (yeah, i felt like heaving) 4. carly's twin brother nick also survives, but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg.5. nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs, and then is decapitated. his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink.. then he gets covered in wax.6. wade (carly's boyfriend) gets his achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors, and then is attacked by the same scissors. he doesn't die, but hes covered in wax, and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed, revealing his nasty bloody flesh. yummy...so there it is. definitely worth your money.

admittedly, before seeing house of wax, i assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as the darkness or amityville horror. after catching an advanced showing at my college campus, i can honestly say that the people at dark castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher. starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip, coming across an odd detour taking them through country back-roads, meeting creepy locals, after the slow but mandatory back-story this movie really reaches a fast clip. paris hilton appears in this film as many already know, but i really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. clearly her acting wasn't worth an oscar, but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her, let's just say, less noble media appearance into this film. ms. hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie, and not simply because it was her death scene.this movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares, but jaume serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters. the causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters, which we do. by making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments. these standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film, and provide many good scares. in fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded house of wax museum is. this film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres, though i'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title. references to such movies as both texas chainsaw masacres, saw, and even titanic, (see paris hilton's big death scene and you'll know what i mean) are common, but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs. not bad.

carly jones (elisha curtberth), her bad boy brother nick (chad michael murray), her boyfriend wade (jared padalecki), and her friends paige (paris hilton) and her boyfriend blake (robert richard) and dalton (jon abrahams) travel to another city to watch an important game. they decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day. however, the fan belt of wade's car breaks and he stays with carly to buy a new one in a close town, where there is a house of wax. when they arrive in the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two deranged former siamese brothers have transformed people in wax statues.i liked this "house of wax", indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie. the story follows the standards of "the texas chainsaw massacre" and other slash movies, and it is well made, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the death scenes are amazing. even if the movie were not good, watching the sexy and delicious paris hilton is worth. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a casa de cera" ("the house of wax")

i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed it.it's been one of the better horror/thriller films in the past few years, if not one of the best and most entertaining.i've heard a lot of people bashing the so-called slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutes.yet if the film dived straight into the deaths, audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldn't care less about.well as for the character development, i think it worked amazingly well.taking into my own response and others (from reading posts off the message board), a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live, one of which i've noticed many people mentioning being paige edwards (paris hilton). taking into consideration warner. bros. have been marketing her death, its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival.speaking of the chase/death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful i've witnessed in a while, and enjoyed each one very much.the acting in the film was absolutely fine, i couldn't fault any of them, especially paris hilton, i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film, yet her chase scene made up for that, and believe me when i say paris can act scared, (watch the scene where she's hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her .... the look of terror on her face comes across as very real).overall i give house of wax maximum stars, for entertainment value and suspense and even gore ...... only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film, they hadn't revealed the death list and who dies and who survives, as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death.can't wait for the dvd, but go see it at the cinema while you can, it won't be the same in your own front room, yet if you do wait for the dvd, watch the film in the dark with no interruptions, trust me you wont be disappointed.

this is the greatest movie ever. if you have written it off with out ever seeing it. you must give it a second try.

this is a little film with a big heart. excellent acting throughout and directed with love. if you missed it in theatres (and who didn't?), catch it with someone you love. frankly, i cried! and i'm a guy, for cryin' out loud!

this is a brilliant film. the story starts off in romania,where billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. there is a really funny scene here, where crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of crystal's religion). he is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river. believing he is dead, some huge hands come out to reach him. he later thinks he is in heaven. he finds out that he isn't, but that he is in a monastery. believing god saved him, he becomes a monk, searching for who saved him. he later finds a 7 ft 7 in man, who he casts as the perfect villain (he also recites shakespeare!). see the film and find out the rest!

containing billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for billy crystal. this movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with steven seagal). this movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. the balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid. the discovery of billy crystal's talent scout/agent character in romania of a giant human is revealing and the behind the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating. yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self. eight out of ten stars.

i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie. to me, this storyline is about a man with growth hormonal disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for. trying his very best to fit into the society who doesn't seemed to accept him.he then met someone who treats him with best friend's love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have. the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant, which is family and spouse love.and the comedy, it's just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows.and i must admit, it made me tear a little.

i always liked this movie, i have seen it so many times but i always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. but the only thing i have to disagree with is that i don't think max lived in a romanian monastery or what was that :p they don't look that way in romania.. anyway, back to the story, ghita muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his english needs to improve. and there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. it worths being seen, i thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. i recommended to you all. it's not the best movie ever, but it was nice!

first off, i absolutely loved this movie. as a billy crystal fan, i must say that i was expecting more comedic situations than i actually got. however, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. his portrayal of talent agent sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. in addition, gheorghe muresan (as maximus) was superb in his first film role. when sammy goes to romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. he never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life. sammy and max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. plus, the location in czech republic where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. i have to say, this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. i thought it was excellent and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.the artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. but, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. late in the film, his being annoying, abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished. while all this didn't make him a particularly nice man, it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist.i really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie (like in lust for life). i really wish i could show this to my students (i teach at a school for the arts), but can't because there is just too much adult material. yes there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (particularly younger ones) is when he,....hmmm,...i don't think imdb will even let me describe what occurred, but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids. not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did not need to be seen, but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film. it's a real shame.

that's right. ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. and the message is sad. it says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other vips of this world. and even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. it is about the battle of a single person with a system. with many systems.a great film of this wonderful korean director. please see it if you do have an opportunity.

it is not surprising that this film was made by i'm at the time it was. i'm examined the early beauty and tragedy of chosun dynasty life in seopyonje and delightfully explored a well-known korean folk tale in chunhyang, and these comprised his last two films. what is most surprising is that chi hwa seon, his 2002 offering, is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films.nonetheless, the experienced hand of i'm comes through. we explore together the life of a real person: a late nineteenth century chosun dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who, because of that, causes a stir in contemporary korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old korean noble class and his contempt for would-be japanese ruling colonials alike. the painter, chang seung up, known popularly as oh won (performed magnificently by choi min sik, the famous star of park chan wook's already legendary "oldboy") becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. contemporary korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact, or maybe because of the fact, that he was so ostracized in his time. i'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. i'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies, and in this film he almost outdoes himself. as expected in an i'm film, the cinematography is breathtaking, the editing is precise and the story is central.plots are set against seung up, family ties are tested and broken, scandalous behavior is alleged (and is sometimes real), all to bring down the man who "painted fire." but against all the intricacies of i'm's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of seung up's life, seung up himself somehow manages to survive. he becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous chinese paintings after only one look. art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off "oh won." in other words, lines of people, who wish to take advantage of the real seung up, an artistic star, begin to form. but he refuses to be manipulated. his cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience, if not the cast. what does seung up think? he possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. he despises those who would try to turn art into profit. and he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. but he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from france and japan are presented. i'm's signature historical epic motif, and his influence in the realm, remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic. the protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. this is when the story takes on a whole new meaning, one that is not just political, but social in nature. i'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion. he, oh won, becomes a jesus figure. the people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. eventually, both government and people come down upon seung up in a manner taken straight out of the bible. his holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes from) the sins of the commoners, the art critics, the politicians, who hound him. but does he die? as with most of i'm's films, a question remains. in this case, does seung up really become an immortal hermit? the film does not tackle that question; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of chang seung up, or oh won. no death is depicted because no death is known. it is difficult to find fault with this film, but i'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does, it hardly surprises anymore. as usual for i'm's films, the cinematography, the editing and the writing are all first rate. it's a well-crafted film imbued with i'm's uncanny story-telling ability. granted, he may be best at doing this through the ancient korean musical art of pansori. still, the film contains stretches of this admirable art form, and by the end, viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great, untold story. and they have, because that, precisely, is i'm's gift.

this film, winning im kwon-taek the best director at cannes in 2002 (tied with p.t. anderson for punch-drunk love), is about a 19th century korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on korean painting. one of the strengths?of the film is that im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, jang seung-up (choi min-shik),?receive inspiration.the costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good. it's not a movie that moved me, but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it. that's pretty cool. it's also interesting to see a version of korea during those times right before the turn of the century, where chinese and japanese powers are both in korea and the chosun kingdom is coming to an end. more than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film, but are never the center. it's firmly on the painter.in the end, it's a well made film about the life of a painter. but it doesn't exactly have the regular three-act structure plot, so you have to be able to take a non-standard hollywood story to watch it. yay for art! 8/10

inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! but still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.

not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but i loved this movie. i am a student of asian art with a particular love of korean art, culture and history. i thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. jang seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill. this movie honors his talent while taking a direct look at his erratic and somewhat self-destructive personality. the cinematography in my opinion was beautiful, many of the outdoor panoramic shots looked like korean landscape paintings (which i found a lovely conceit rather than "overly arty") and i think that choi min-sik portrayed jang seun-up with a necessary intensity and unpredictability. i would highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers alike.

this movie could be a bit boring for some people, but i find this filmvery interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition.the director, lim, has made two films about traditional music in korea before this film. the film before this one was showing the music throughout the film, and this film is trying to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the movie just like a painting.another thing is that, the story is written by both director and a philosopher, kim who is well known scholar in korea (holding a lot of degrees - including doctor at havard) i'm not saying that educated people make better films but that philosopher is an expert in traditional culture in korea, so it gives more credit on this film.

what a movie! i have always liked the asian style of shooting, and this movie does not disappoint at all! photography is breath-taking, ranging from amazing landscapes to whirls of colours. the main actor is really realistic in representing the painter (whose paintings are astonishing). the ending is also very well chosen, very poetic. the only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women. but altogether this is an excellent film!

the fire gives all... this is one of film's most masterful meditations on artistry. set in 19th century korea it tells the story of the famous painter ohwon, but rather than stick to saucy anecdote, melodrama, or psychological egg hunting, it portrays a series of episodes throughout his life, all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves. it gives no interpretation of these episodes, but leaves them for the viewer to ponder along with the paintings of ohwon himself. in this way, the viewer enters into the same sort of contemplation as ohwon, and minus his talent can "feel" their way into the inspiration of his paintings. part of why this is so effective is the utterly masterful evocation of 19th century korea and the musical/artistic world that ohwon moved in. there are so many gorgeous shots of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world inspiring ohwon, ohwon living and looking in that world, and the works of art he creates, all mirroring off one another. the story is told with extreme economy. a feeling evoked is hardly ever lingered with or explained, it just appears quickly then is gone for the next one to appear. as an analogy it is a sort of mozartian work of art (endless and quick succession of great ideas) rather than beethovinian (obsessive lingering on one great idea). it has a classical restraint, much like ohwon's paintings. there is really no music hinting how to feel except a few classical korean pieces used with great effectiveness in several scenes (and mostly played by characters in the movie). one haunting image, if i remember correctly, is of a flock of birds soaring away over the blue mountains while a female singer croons"this life is like a dream, and only death will awaken us" one telling line of advice in the film, from one of ohwon's teachers, is that "the painting lies between the strokes." the film follows that attitude as there is so much matter *between* what is spoken and described in the film. i have seen it twice and it was very rewarding on the second viewing. a very terse film, with little in the way of obvert explanation, one could see how it is im's 96th film. it is an artistic masterwork. like ohwon's great friend and mentor tells him in describing one of his paintings, "not a single stroke is wasted." i compare it to andrei rubylev in quality, though in style it is very different. it is much easier and more directly entertaining to watch, but classical in form where andrei is gothic. all in all highly recommended to almost anyone except appetite junkies. both times i left the film i felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. one point of ohwon's life that intruiged me was that his mad drinking and raving began suddenly after visiting the noble who told him that "good art can come only from great knowledge and learning." the next brief scene ohwon was very angry, and the next blasted drunk as he often remained for the remainder of the film. i am curious why the nobles words effected him so much and drove him to the drinking that dominated the rest of his life. or was it just a coincidence?

chi-hwa-seong (painted fire) recounts the life of korean painter jang seong-ub amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century korea.however, the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society.jang seong-ub is played masterfully as a complex character who changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. this characterization mirrors the young eager artist that finds it more and more difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire out via drink, erections, and desire.although this character development proceeds overall gradually through the film, the emotional complexity of jang is still played in a constantly oscillating manner building to the films' finale. interestingly, the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as scenes seamlessly transition from one time and location to another without any conventional 'cues' to the audience that such a scene change will occur. for example, many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location.the visual scenery of the film is presented beautifully and also oscillates from stark (and perhaps bleak) black and white scenery to more colorful and alive environments that again parallel the paintings of jang either in simple black ink on white paper or with color added. rainbows of color enter the film at points as the artist observes nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings.the theme of an artist's individual desire to create versus the expectations and demands of society arises in the film through various points including class distinction, the domination of government over the artist, the accepted norms of the artistic elite, and the base desires of the common masses. instead of creating his own completely original works, jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces of other artists throughout east asia. the question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic merit.i wish that i was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly grasp how they tied into the story - but beyond any comparison to the current role of korean government in artistic expression and/or censorship i cannot comment.overall an extremely well acted film and the cinematography is often breathtaking. a great film to see and then ponder over.

wow, what a wonderful film-making! mr. im has done it, again!his last work, chunhayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. selected as an official feature film in the canne festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a korean culture.simply, chihwaseon is about a great korean painter, '(ohwon) jang, seung-up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late nineteenth century. the basic story of this film tells the life of jang, seung-up, and the historical background of his time. he was an orphan, but in his teens, he was picked up by a noble man, called, kim, byung-moon. this mr.kim becomes a mentor of jang as well as life-long friendship, and continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place. with jang's great effort and natural talent, his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country, korea falls down.jang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated, and one of the best actors in korea, choi, min-sik goes deep inside of jang's soul. suffering eyes reveal the struggle of a great artist's life. he is very serious sometimes, but all of sudden, he changes to a wild maniac. he drinks like an alcoholic, and sleeps with courtesans anytime. even, he said in the movie, "without an alcohol and a woman, i can't draw. (an alcohol and women are my only inspirations)" in the peak of the fame, to develope his own style, he travels all around the country, and never gives up his pride as an artist for the authority or money. i don't want to give out every details, but i think you surely did get some ideas about the film.the most amazing thing about this film is a cinematography. it is just so breath-taking how they captured every beauty of landscapes. yes, each scene is like a work of jang's painting. and the script is perfect, too. it mainly deals a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist. for example, kim advices to jang in the movie that 'before one holds a paintbrush, one has to set an aim in life'. this is very moving and inspiring line, and there are many more.go see this film if you are going to be in the canne festival.chihwasun will be the greatest film ever made that deals with the life of a painter in film history.

i know a lot of people have said don't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles. that is a really lazy way to think of a movie. if you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else, and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art, this being a masterful piece of work. if you want to watch this, its not about the fighting really. there are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work, but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part. this is not the basic kung-fu movie. the story is really the central focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.

first of all, around the time i wrote this comment, i had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. this is a video game and not an actual movie. i mean, i myself would choose a good deniro movie or playing a video game any day. but, dude, what are you talking about? now that i have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? the video game adaption of crouching tiger, hidden dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name. what's stranger is that this was released three years after the film was released. whether that's due to a slow development time or just plain laziness, no one really knows. at least, i don't.the game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie: jen, shu lien, li-mu-bi, and dark cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for separate gameplay.) all four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie. however, the real eye candy is the evasion moves that allow each character to avoid the blows of an enemy's attack in the most impossible and gravity defying ways that were first showcased in the movie.the story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. the story in the game is told using cg movies and spoken in a subtitled mandarin language (a nice little touch, considering i preferred the foreign language track of the film over the dubbed one.) the story goes to expand on what might've happened to the other characters during the film and even (no real surprise since pretty much all video game movie adaptions have done this) alters what officially happened in the movie to make the game have more action. i never thought jade fox would go so far as to actually go and get hired goons.the real bonus for the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. what if jen had all the ingredients to cure li-mu-bi in her possession? what if jen had not gotten back her comb? what if li-mu-bi had not gotten the green destiny back for the second time? your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the destiny of the characters in this game. this is truly the best feature of the game.yet, for all it's strengths, it also showcases some flaws. the enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed on the most unhelpful of spots. not even the special features (which are unlocked after beating the game) are good enough to even forgive such hardships that are forced upon the player.if you loved the movie, you may enjoy the game. however, this game is the only way you're going to be able to immerse yourself into a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie.of course, you could have just picked a deniro movie instead.

first of all i want to say ang lee did a very good job on this one! i watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. the story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say "this sucks people cant fly!" to them i say it's fiction and that it is. this is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a "fairytale". and a very pleasant to watch asian fairytale. the image's can actually blow your mind. because there so artistically filmed , ang lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent. the fight scene's are very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer. but it's sad but this film didn't get the appreciation it should have gotten. but ang lee did fortunately get the attention he deserved with his blockbuster broke back mountain. so even for viewers who are not interested in the story the images are entertaining enough!

i cannot hate on the show. when the old (and better) tech tv had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in. "attack of the show" is the replacement for the screen savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. they were kevin rose, kevin pereira and sarah lane. brendan moran came to be something of a co-host as well, but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. kevin rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that didn't pan out for some reason.eventually (i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard) sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because (hey, this is what i read) the two got married. that was a big secret to me! now there is a new female co-host, the not-as-hot (my opinion) olivia munn. she's hiding something in those tops she wears, while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it.ahem! sorry."attack of the show" deals with everything young people want to know about. it's music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. this is what's great about the show. if you don't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv, you can get all you want on aots. some segments and bits they do are funny. they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names.even though the hosts aren't as geek as i'd like them to be, i still have found "attack of the show" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.

i've been watching attack of the show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). i was very infatuated with olivia and i found kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. first my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called around the net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally). umm, this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff, i really haven't seen anything that good and i can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times. the show is like a late show wanna be/colbert report wanna be with it's politics also, if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor gets old also, mccain is old, yeah yeah, whatever. libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves, so it's almost every show bash mccain or palin, sheesh. so we get the same old vids of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never laugh's at itself out of it's own weakness. i'll keep watching since i watch at work and it's all that's on, hoping that i'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old. i did like the fill in host's of chris and alison though, they were actually a good change of pace; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. olivia who i thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old, lol. 7 of 10; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger baby boomer like me (mid 40's). maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there is a ton of stuff available they could use.

i watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. it provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. they are also the official broadcasters of e3 and comiccon. if you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. they have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). it's the only place that i get my tech info. kevin pereira and olivia munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... universe. if you know those universes you will understand the jokes. long story short, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about. i'm watching it right now as i type this, they are 'in' san diego covering the red bull air races. sweet.

most of the criticism of "attack of show" is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer tv program called "the screen savers." people are upset because g4 decided to cancel the "screen savers" and replace it with the pop culture based "attack of the show." to compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges!"attack of the show" is a unique hour long program that covers current generation x/y culture. it features segments on movies/television, panel discussions, video games, new dvd releases, sex advice, new gadgets (mp3 players, cell phones, etc), comic books/graphic novels, magazines, and internet fads. it's a fun show, definitely worth checking out you are in your 20s or 30s. i give it an 8 out of 10.

an interesting movie based on three of jules verne's novels. considering the special effects and computer enhanced animation of today, this movie stands as an historic marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination. karel zeman has brought to life the lithographic images of the original jules verne texts. this is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs.i give this movie 9 out of 10. enjoy!!

like the first film in this series (slaughter, 1972), i think it would be a mistake to just label this a "blaxsploitation film". sure, slaughter is a tough, gun-toting, black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys--and a very good action picture at that.for the second and final time, jim brown plays the title character. the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film. as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party, along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire! no, slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his .357! but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened--however, slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it! well, it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie. in it, slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico. now, in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt, the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter. and, because the job was bungled so badly, the mob boss (ed macmahon!!) orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin (don stroud--in a very typical sort of role for him). stroud is great--scary and nasty to the core, but ed macmahon as the boss?! wow, that's an interesting twist! slaughter is now stumped. he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them, they were dead. so, to help him along in his own private vendetta, brock peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work. so, slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials. and, naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process.stroud isn't about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps slaughter's girlfriend. now it's a standoff--slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back, the lady is dead. being a tough but gallant man, you might just be able to guess much of what happens next.the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough. the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss, at the end, he simply folded--and way too quickly. when slaughter catches up to him, macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears--and this is too much of a clich√© and inconsistent. still, despite this minor quibble, it's an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs.

complete entertainment! although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself doesn't have them including the autumn characters (mother and daughter) the general concept rocks.

this is possibly one of my favorite films. it tells the tale of a girl named gerda (chelsea hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. she falls in love with the bell boy named kai. however, on her birthday the snow queen (bridget fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps kai. gurda then goes after kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.i thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast. it has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow. i think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy. i have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why i have given it a 10!

i have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. every time, i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go, and the strenght of both kai and gertha to struggle for what they believe in.and the whole story is presented in such a way, you just get transfered into the plot and before you know it, you are there. you can see... yeah, there's kai... working hard on the mirror... a little jump.... there's gertha, fighting for her love..... and there's the snow queen...it's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, tension.it's brilliant 10 out of 10

this is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. sylia, nene, linna, and priss are all back as the knight sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. the animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. there is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy. the dvds also have many extras, including commentaries, which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. a must-have for any anime fan.also recommended: burst angel, armitage iii

when i started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the action channel,i have to say out of all the shows that i've seen that adv released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. i had to see it again,and that's when i got my chance. i bought the entire box set of this series at best buy for my 20th birthday. and i got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that i missed on action channel,and the same 3 episodes that i've seen. my favorite characters in this show are: sylvia,leon,and nigel. the animation in this series was the best,and the hard suits were cool as well. but the show also has a great voice cast like:chris patton,jason douglas,christine auten,and hillary haag,and more. so if you like this show on action channel,then you have to own it on dvd. it's the best,and you will see what i mean.

back in the mid/late 80s, an oav anime by title of "bubblegum crisis" (which i think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire) made its debut on video, taking inspiration from "blade runner", "the terminator" and maybe even "robocop", with a little dash of batman/bruce wayne - iron man/tony stark and charlie's angel's girl power thrown in for good measure. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in 21st century tokyo, japan, year 2032-2033, living machines called boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems. a special, swat like branch of law enforcers, the advanced police (ad police for short) were formed to handle the boomers, but were mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist sylia stingray, the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers, to create four powered combat armor (hard suits) to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers, genom. that group becomes known as the knight sabers, and in addition to ring leader sylia, her rag-tag band of rebel women included priss asagiri, a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops, linna yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and nene romanova, a young officer of the adp and expert computer hacker (the first in a long line). genom, meanwhile, is represented by quincy, a tall, gaunt old guy who happens to own the company, his younger assistant brian j. mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer man named largo. other characters included leon mcnichol and daley wong, two ad police detectives (leon appeared in a spin-off/prequel anime, "ad police files" which i heard was very dark), their balding, overweight boss chief todo, sylia's younger brother mackey, and a funny little mechanic known as dr. raven, who apparently helps sylia with maintaining the suits. aside from the overall knight sabers & ad police vs genom storyline, there was also another storyline involving a friend of linna's who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family, the annoying largo trying to usurp genom, and various priss-wants-revenge-for-a-minor-character story. oh and did i mention that there were hints that sylia herself might have been a boomer?well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all. so some of the storylines, like largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of linna's ill-fated friend, and sylia's origins, were never resolved. another problem with the series was that at the time priss was the most popular character, so a good portion of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the priss oriented episodes basically focused on priss self-righteously seeking justice/revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers, yet she rarely went out of her way for her the knight sabers, who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well-being (just to be fair though, she did go to rescue linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the adp acted wrongly in the investigation). this meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of sylia, or even the day-to-day antics of nene and linna. linna had two episodes oriented around her, which pertained to her friend with the mafia family, while nene managed to snag the last episode for herself, which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness. nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit, or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof, which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor linna, who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention. don't get me wrong, i like it and i love the overall concept of it all, but it did irk me a little bit. also this is one of those runner-ups for "worst english voice dubbing of all time" features, meaning you'd better stick to the japanese. some of the voices were okay (some really did match their characters personas) but others were just flat and passionless or, in the case of priss, really overacted.well, tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window. set a few years ahead, the story here is that after earthquakes shattered tokyo, genom's boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise, except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle, which prompts the ad police to be formed followed by the knight sabers being formed. so the overall story is the same, but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot.1) originally sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed like a stern, proper business woman and was distant from others. 2040 sylia has more of a super-model look to her, dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray), and also 2040 sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public, and possibly keeps even more secrets than before. sylia also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield, as she is more of a stay-in-the-mobile-pit type here, but she does do battle when she has to.2) originally priss was a short woman with an afro and a really bad temper, always picking fights with people who offended her, always biting off more than she could chew, etc. 2040 priss, however, has gone the way of the clint eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original sylia you might say), so she's not really attached to anyone. also her hair is more stingry and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is clad in leather like trinity from "the matrix" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the adp).3) originally linna had this big black hair going for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more 90s like. 2040 linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed. as if to apologize for the way she was treated by the oav writers, the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to linna, writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the knight sabers and win a spot with them, which she eventually does.4) originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at adp detective leon mcnichol (revenge for him toying with her in the oav?) and other characters, even her surrogate big sister linna and mackey, sylia's "brother", whom she becomes infatuated with. cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status.5) nigel kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, ruggedly handsome man with long black hair (he looks like adrian paul from tv's highlander), he replaces dr. raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to sylia's hard suits. nigel is also sylia's lover, but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor. he's kind of the father/big brother/mentor figure to mackey.6) leon and daley are back, but of course differently. the original leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans, and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down, he was kind of a jerk, but he served mostly as comic relief, as he tried to pursue priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and daley served as information guides to important plot points. also the original daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink/purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on leon when not providing important information. in 2040, leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, tall and sporting big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he actually looks like arnold schwarzenegger a little bit, or maybe a pumped up colin farrell, or hugh jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a big one, but it's not as powerful as before. although 2040 leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm (especially in approaching priss), he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series, but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by nene and daley (also he drinks way too much coffee). oh, and leon is still after priss, but he has a lot more luck this time around. daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not as tall as leon) more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually looks like james marsden from the x-men films); daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the oav and, although it's not completely clear, his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared, save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about leon inquiring about priss's e-mail.7) brian j. mason (what does that "j" stand for?) is back, and so is quincy, but mason is much more the main villain here, with quincy as co-villain, as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him. mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the oav (he actually looks like oav leon in a suit) and he is very much from the alan rickman school of villains.8) though a pervert in the first series, mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. of course, there are lots of things different about mackey in 2040, but they won't be revealed here.9) sylia now has a companion, an alfred-the-butler type named henderson, who worries about her and the gang.10) in the original series, boomers were like the replicants in "blade runner", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they're more of the dumb-monsters-on-the-rampage type. most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do (heavy labor, combat, clean up, etc) and they have this tendency to "go rogue", which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process.what does stay the same is the theme of humanity vs technology (do machines have souls?). sadly, this series, though well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves by faster than one might like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits (which i will not discuss here. what saves this show and makes it what it is, however, is the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs they are, ranging from stoic loners, psycho women, genocidal mad men, rough neck cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old sages, and loveable innocents, much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of, they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer.it's not great, but it's a good watch. also the english dub (by adv) is quite good, though not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than the dub on the original.

a boat builder in a sleepy town in maine is going out of business, and the lives of all of the (soon to be ex-)workers and families are disrupted. the biggest disappointment is that the two stars--bates and bridges--have only bit parts.interesting, but not something you would see twice.

legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne) dies of a heart attack. a bunch of drama school students steal radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. writer/director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere. the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods, with a gal being set on fire, a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!), and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights. kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b-flick faces: mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role, leon askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director wolfgang, nita talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs. rohmer, plus there are nice turns by luca bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader saint, jennifer starrett as the sweet meg, jeffrey combs as the geeky stu, and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo. popping up in cool bits are chuck "porky" mitchell as a detective, patrick wright in one of his customary policeman parts, and tallie cochrane as a corpse. joel king's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot. a fun little fright flick.

buddy holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. the young singer/songwriter from lubbock, texas left his mark on the template of modern music. inspired by elvis presley, holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. holly would take his place with presley, chuck berry, jerry lee lewis and ricky nelson as the voices of teenage angst.this easy to watch bio is not without flaws. some situations, events, places and even names were not correct for various reasons. what makes this movie so believable is that gary busey did his own singing in the part of holly. a well produced soundtrack became a multi-million seller.busey was nominated for an oscar. other stars of note are don stroud, conrad janis, charles martin smith and maria richwine.

gary busey is superb in this musical biography. great singing and excellent soundtrack. the buddy holly story is a much better movie than la bamba. from reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. regardless, it is a fun toe-tapping film, and a good introduction to buddy holly's music.

considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer buddy holly. gary busey stars as holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. backed up by his crickets, holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with richie valens and the big bopper. the film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. i like this film and believe that you will too. charles martin smith also does a great job in this film.

gary busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend buddy holly(1936-59). he does have a spitting image to the man. being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. i bet that buddy holly(busey) was a much better musician than most of what i heard. since he lived in lubbock, texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. his parents were christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. that's one of the reasons he didn't act like elvis. he stuck to his kinder ways. that really makes him good! when he went to tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. they hated rock-n-roll, that turned holly off big time. getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to holly and his friends. he got to tour with sam cooke, went to the famous apollo, which the all-afro-american audience quickly accepted them, i liked that! and sam cooke made sure holly and his band got some service. that's what i call tolerance. it's sad that he, ritchie valens, and j.p. "the big bopper" richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live on in our hearts. i don't what inaccuracies were in the movie, all i care is that buddy holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time, and the music is nearly-perfect. for gary busey, he was perfect in the role, and making the music as well. god bless you gary busey! 5 stars!

i've got to say it. gary busey saved this film. if it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. i recommend the film but just barely.the biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. for example, why is lubbock green and hilly? how come buddy's producer petty ignored? where are the daily trips to the clovis, new mexico studio? why is nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the holly sound? why was buddy's two week courtship to maria treated as a complex, taboo, race mixing stereotype? why are buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers? finally, why are the crickets portrayed as trouble making roadblocks to holly's talent?taken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming itself, "the buddy holly story." however, busey does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.

i first saw the buddy holly story when i was about seven years old. i had no idea who buddy holly was, nor can i remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to hbo, and watch this engaging biopic. what i remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. i recall the music, great songs that i still love today (i can't believe gary busey sang his own songs and so well - what a stud!) then, came the end. he died. he freaking died. i couldn't believe it. i had no warning, no prior knowledge like most coming into this film. it taught me a harsh lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most movies teach us. i just watched the film again tonight and was engaged all over again... and a little saddened.8 out of 10, but i'll admit to a little bias.

it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other. both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives. as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to 'complexities of subplots' and screen time, it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth. adding to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources (eg comparisons with written history) and the logics behind arguments, history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary.to most people, documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants' testimonies and real-life footages. however, these visuals are selected and edited, to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers. in the real buddy holly story, paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world. the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy. the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events, such as there were 3 members of crickets and that buddy's music was actually heard outside of usa at that time (he had to embark on a world tour!). however, it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddy's wife after his death. criticism and/or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered. eventually, we don't manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past 'realties' that the documentary tells us.personally, i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries, which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era. it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story, and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story. there is also an element of flexibility which allows film-makers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues. in the buddy holly story, racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations.movie-goers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film, and using these emotions, audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a film-maker wants to deliver. in most stories, people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles, the inspirations and the way the story ends. through the buddy holly story, we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had, how maria had been a source of encouragement, and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies.

the buddy holly story is a great biography with a super performance from gary busey. busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job.

ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! it was either a failed script for "abc afterschool special", or the product of an earnest rookie writer, just out of college, making an homage to that classic pc anti-gun homily from 1974, "the gun". in fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being melted down like in the movie!no, i'm not some nra shill. it's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. geez!ok, the sociology lesson is over. the message has been delivered. the important episode has been aired. now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.

if filming is about vision and real life this movie is quite perfect: nuovomondo talks about immigration in the usa from italy the beginning of '900, but it speak also for now, when emigration/immigration is still a focus . it doesn't to be rich to be a visionary film.acting at extra level, charlotte gainsbourg a star. a good challenge for the academy award 2007after first crialese's attempt, "respiro", an emotional but too intellectual movie, this one has learned fellini's and taviani's lesson, to name just two italian masters.plot is arguing, directing accurate, maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective.if volver ( challenging for academy award next year ) by almodovar is a mature movie by an always brilliant director, nuovomondo deserves it more, because of his good effort to be a european movie for the american scene.and this is it!

where do i start. do i say how great the cinematography is. do i praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity. do i tell how realistic the scenes on ellis island are. should i mention that for a change we do not have the clich√© scene of viewing statue of liberty. (by now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships railing is a clich√©)now whats not likable, two major things, one being a modern song score & not even a good one to boot.second & nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow, that watching paint dry would be an improvement.the 118 minute running time is to long & yet the film seems unfinished. we see no scenes of this family in the us. our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother, i would have enjoyed scenes of his futile of maybe lucky search, instead of other drawn out scenes.the film is a near miss.ratings *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)

this is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a sicilian farm, the boat,and ellis island new york. all shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. i wonder if this was to save money? no street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. and the music...what on earth was going on with playing nina simone songs, decades before they were out? i could have done without the milk river business too......but hey, before you think of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, this is a very good film, with heartbreakng moments, wonderful photography, great characters and more accuracy than the usual (american) efforts at the immigration experience.

an interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.i got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from sicily who traveled to america. i imagine much the same as my grandfather did at that time. travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, i cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.laws restricting immigrants existed. i would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the mediterranean and africa. immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities. in the film, we see physical and mental exams, the latter because of the view that low intelligence is heritable. single women could not enter the country, on the presumption that they would become prostitutes, so most married single men already in the country, as arranged beforehand, at ellis island before entry.this is the story of a british immigrant (charlotte gainsbourg), who arranges to marry a poor sicilian (vincenzo amato). he is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother (aurora quattrocchi) that is considered feeble-minded. she was fantastic in the role, by the way.you will also see character actor, vincent schiavelli, in his next to the last appearance. i don't know if his last film has been released. he plays a matchmaker, and is also very good.it was a strange, but enjoyable film. it's not for everyone, as i imagine those who don't have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow.

this review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was...saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants, like my italian grandparents who came through ellis island at the turn of the last century, would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter america.it was certainly eye opening, since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there. my grandmother was 5-years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived.i just returned from a trip to new york where i had the pleasure of visiting ellis island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process - the filmmaker obviously did his research, right down to the medical exams and equipment, questions and puzzles. they are all there at the museum. even the wedding pictures and the review board room -- factually correct! anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie. inspirational to say the least.

i have never missed an episode. david morse is a wonderful actor and i am hoping that this show can survive. it certainly beats out that csi crap. i love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday. i give the show a 10.

"ahh...i didn't order no amazing hit show"....."we'll you got one" hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. a little bit of me died when i flicked on the t.v. one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn't on. the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. i found that at the end of any episode i watched; i walked away having been both entertained and informed. i am actually dumber now that hack is gone. i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. since hack has been gone i see them as eyesore's and an unneeded strain on taxpayers. so for the love of god we need to bring back hack!

he's not your conventional cab driver.this guys got issues. with his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and most of all himself. and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it. so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so. i think this is a great show, and i hope people catch-on before the season's over. watch this show!!!!!!!!!

this is not your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases. the episodes, so far, are more realistic and intelligent.if you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking rambo-style cop story, you will not find it here.i gave it a 9. i wish this series lives long. morse is excellent!

everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role. his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action, i watch this show because its got great acting, a good premise, and a great story-line every week. it's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by, or know what intersection he's at. i love this show and i love philly!! give this show a shot!

it is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! as an added bonus, it is nice to see some local home boys from massachusetts making good in l.a. i hope this show will be a keeper.

an extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast. one of the few shows that i try to watch on a regular basis. glad to see bebe neuwirth in a recurring role, but feel andre braugher is underutilized. he is one intense actor! hope cbs gives it a better time slot next season.

okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' week in, week out david morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by david koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!due to the lack of love for this show by many, i can't see it going to a season series - but you never know? the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let's hope something good can make it past a first series!!!

this is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. this is a john hughes movie meets the devil's rejects. i really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. i thought jennifer tilly played tiffany really well and brad dourif in chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. actually they're the only good parts of the movie. i got rather bored with katherine heigl and nick stable's scenes. it's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. but chucky and tiffany were great to watch and i really liked the black humor to it. i thought it made the movie stand out more. if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out.7/10.

great movie! chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. jennifer tilly (tiffany) makes this movie even better! well before chucky died tiffany and him were together. but like ten years later tiffany gets chucky back (as a doll) and brings him back to life. it was a great movie!scary and definetly funny (only because chucky!)10/10

this is a good film for die-hard chucky fans. okay i'm sure it's not as good as what the child's play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, chucky's laughs are hilarious.(spoilers)now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, jennifer tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.if you have seen the child's play movies this would be a worthy film on your chucky collection, but if you've never seen the child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start. of course you'll not have a clue on how chucky got into his current state (cause i'm not telling you) but you'll figure out why chucky is very popular.overall a very enjoyable movie.

chucky's back...and it's about time! this time, with the help of jennifer tilly and a little spell from voodoo for dummies. well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. this was the more gruesome of this series, so far. it has some good twists and some good action scenes. this one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. i am looking forward to seed of chucky. it'll be a hoot!"jesus, the music scene's gone to h3ll since i've been dead!" chuckywe needed the levity, as the doll thing's getting old. the added comedic element, and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first, when the idea was fresh and new-ish.6.8/10 from...the fiend :.

remember back when this movie was made by robert downey senior. a very good entertaining black awareness feature, which, was an underground hit in california-los angeles, and new york at the time. a hippy loved classic where, changes which occur in the business world are striking, refreshing and interesting comedy.non compliant, not like basic society at the time of 1969 now watched, is still very good,but today's life in america totally diferent from 69. good for the baby boomers.

the movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. putney swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a "token" on the board. swope is ignoring the meeting, reading jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring swope... suddenly, the ceo croaks on the spot. no time is wasted. a janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new ceo. and as the votes are tallied one by one, the tension is built up and then finally snapped in a hilariously ironic climax to the vote, that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical implications to savor for the rest of the movie. if you've ever talked back to some stupid television commercial, you'll like seeing this movie. too bad there don't seem to be any real putney swopes in the world.

a twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an old-school, white-bred advertising firm. and he intends to make a few changes...one very strange piece of cinema. you'll either love it or hate it. either way, you've never seen anything like it.

if we could have "separate tables," why not "separate lies."this becomes somewhat involved. a housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. the culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. the latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. to complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. sounds like she wants revenge.this all becomes convoluted. when our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case.as if this isn't enough, several months later, our lover (rupert everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (emily watson) leaves her husband (tom wilkinson) to care for him.the acting is quite good here despite the never-ending "peyton place" like theme. tom wilkinson, is a solicitor, who tries to protect his wife.the film is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness. o well, the marriage ended anyway.

can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? tom wilkinson is no brutal othello, in the setting of modern day england. so, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. and, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. and so the web of "separate lies" begins to fail and then hold together again. and life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives. how many webs of deceit are to be displayed in this growing tapestry? the impulse is to prop up sterling reputations and careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. wilkinson gives an emotional performance, full of grace and discretion and decorum, and yet humanity, of those who have much to hide. those who desire clarity and openness on the way to justice will be disappointed with the wickedness of so much deception. and yet, who among us, has not something similar to hide about his loved ones? nevertheless, the viewer may wonder if this web is fated to crumble some day.

separate lies changed my life. actually, the q&a did.spoilers below. read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:the emily watson character cheats on the tom wilkonson character. my first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed emily was "it's over. dump her. bad riddance." for some reason, he stuck around. not in a pathetic way. he just listened. and tried to accept her needs. at times he needed to leave. but he stuck by her and let her live her life. but i still wanted to see her afterwards, julian, the screenwriter and director, talked about the film. i'm glad he did, because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me. tom's character loved her, and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants, he would always love her. the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie, all of a sudden, just because she wanted to be with someone else. the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was. when you get past fifty, there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again, so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger. you have to try and make things work, because the alternative may be much worse.she needed what she needed, and she couldn't help that. he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be. he helped her in pursuit of her lover, even when it hurt him.another thing: julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt. again: the strongest tool of a controller is guilt.at the end of the film, tom released her from her burden. he felt a need to let her know that he loved her, but not to in order to get her back; he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way.it is not my way to review a film based on the message, rather than the execution, especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director, but i make an exception here, as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film.the execution of the film-making was a nice, british pace. rupert was slimy and revolting. tom and emily were their usually solid, real characters.

emily watson and tom wilkinson together - what a treat! with rupert everett and linda bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. "contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life." how true these words are. watson's anne manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. she is the decency undeterred. the circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one's professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply don't want to face the consequence; one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship. these are all precarious situations. there lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. contradictions, indeed. in spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. the treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. it's not sensational or complex as another film "where the truth lies" 2005. credits due to fellowes' writing and the nuanced performances of both watson and wilkinson. there is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. and following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two manning's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. you might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in "separate lies," yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. the deserving production efforts include cinematography by tony pierce-roberts (a veteran to the merchant-ivory films) and music by stanislas syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer zbignew priesner (of filmmaker krzysztof kieslowski's trois couleurs, especially: bleu 1993.) this is a british film you just might not want to miss. emily watson (anne, the wife): breaking the waves 1996 debut; hilary and jackie 1998; the luzhin defence 2000; gosford park 2001; punch-drunk love, red dragon, equilibrium in 2002. tom wilkinson (james, the husband): the full monty 1997; the governess, rush hour (as villain) in 1998; in the bedroom 2001, normal (hbo cable movie) 2003, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind 2004, recently as father moore in: the exorcism of emily rose 2005 opposite laura linney. rupert everett (bill): he is simply delightful in "my best friend's wedding" 1997 opposite julia roberts and marvelous in "an ideal husband" 1999 d: oliver parker, an oscar wilde play. recently as sherlock holmes with ian hart as dr. watson, in pbs mystery: sherlock holmes and the case of the silk stockings 2004 tv. linda bassett (maggie): she was very effective as ella khan opposite om puri in "east is east" 1999.

an old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. the rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. separate lies is a very british movie indeed. i'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly british phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very british. tom wilkinson plays james manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a "stiff-upper-lip" attitude towards tragedy. his wife anne (emily watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive, and more prone to drama.the man who really spices up life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire william bule, played by a deliciously devilish rupert everett (most american audiences will eternally remember him as julia roberts' gay friend who completely stole every scene in my best friend's wedding). in separate lies, everett is cruel, cold, and selfish, but he's an absolute blast on screen. no, it's not that exciting of a movie title (separate lies ¬ñ how did they end up with that lame and forgettable title? did they just not have a marketing team? did they just now care about getting people to see this film?), but beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.

another popular screening for a british picture at coalville's century theatre. a well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! a masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director julian fellowes. outstanding performance, as usual, by tom wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda bassett and john neville. our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'. a good tight production at around only 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success, which should see fellowes directing again for the big screen. some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s (as per nigel balchin's novel)but obviously this is not the case. recommended viewing.

although this film is set amongst the sophisticated english upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. it has a slightly dated air, being an adaptation of "a way through the wood", a 1950 novel by nigel balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). julian fellowes, who despite an academy award for the script of "gosford park", has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). with the dvd version i saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by julian. his primary focus was on getting his characters right, and by and large he has succeeded. in this he was helped by two outstanding performances from tom wilkinson as james, the stitched up city lawyer, and emily watson as his attractive wife anne. he also kept it short; the running time is only 80 minutes.james and anne have a town house in chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in buckinghamshire. anne is some years younger but they are childless. outwardly they seem happy, but james, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. just down the road is the aristocratic the hon. william buel, who is not one for middle-class morality, and he is more than happy to take advantage. but there's a complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven range rover just like the hon. bill's. soon james, anne, bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be james' and anne's cleaner) are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. the primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on james and anne's relationship.the third person in this m√©nage a trios, bill, is played by rupert everett. from the point of view of casting, his languid, superior manner is right for the part, yet somehow he doesn't quite get there. partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick, and vice-versa. the part seems underdeveloped. it is interesting that john neville as bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has.the world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked. as julian fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are able to convince themselves that the edwardian age still exists. at bottom though, the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. nigel balchin was going through a marriage break-up when he wrote the book, and fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere. as he says, his is a fairly free adaptation, but the central theme is the same.

a well written screenplay. a moving story showing the middle class english at it's best. some great acting by tom wilkinson and emily watson. tom wilkinson is one of britain's best actors. he knows how to be subtle and honest. emily watson is an actress i was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. the director, julian fellowes did not succumb to the typical hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. it has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the english middle class. the films pace does not falter although it is not a faced paced film. a good twist in the plot, that is not predictable a lovely english country village setting. i enjoyed this film very much the locations were also very well selected. if you enjoy films about relationships this is one to watch. better to have some tissues ready!

wow.this is a touching story! first i saw 'rescue dawn'.i didn't 'like' it. and now i have seen the person , dieter dengler , about whom this story is being told by herzog.very impressing.dieter is a driven human being who encountered the most opposite emotions in his live on this earth.what an extraordinary life this person has led. his tale about the capture by the patet lao/vietcong and thus his suffering is horrifying but what's most impressive is his incredible will to survive.how could he find the strenght ? in a haunting way , dieter is telling us in full flowing sentences about his terrible ordeal during his captivity... he is a great storyteller and herzog does him the justice this brave man deserves.in my opinion.'little dieter needs to fly ' tells it all ! , leaving nothing to the imagination , thus making ' rescue dawn ' a superfluous film. the horror doesn't get more real than in the words of dieter dengler himself.he totally succeeds in painting the picture.

i had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. herzog introduced the film and did an hour long q&a afterward.this is a brilliantly done "documentary"; herzog explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes camouflage the truth. instead he scripts some scenes and ad-libs some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outline.little dieter, unlike timothy treadwell, is a real person that you fall in love with; you cheer for him, you feel the anguish that he feels. you admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after he was taken into captivity by the viet cong. you are disappointed to hear afterward that dieter passed on not too long ago.as in most herzog films, the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music. especially a scene of battle taken from archives of the viet nam war but fitting the story line of dieter.the core of the film has dieter return to the hellish jungle where he was a pow and he re-enacts his journey with some locals. harrowing for us to watch, i can't imagine what he felt as he was bound again.one of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the viet nam war. it should serve as a lesson to us all.

little dieter needs to fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the g√∂teborg filmfestival. as i was extremely tired that evening, i was hesitant to see it, but the raving overall score of 9 here at imdb made me go there.it was 80 minutes of pure life-force! experiencing dieter denglers life through his own telling was enchanting.see it! and if possible... see it at a cinema!

this film is excellent! fear of watching documentary movies? cancel your shrink and watch little dieter's story. you won't believe how captivating this fine piece of film making is until you have experienced it. i'm eager to say that it even out goes almost any vietnam war movie, including apocalypse now. it's a real story, it's a personal story, a story about the love for flying, the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down above enemy's territory. all is shot in a "return to..." style - at location, herzog asking the questions, dieter answering them in a memorable german-english accent, and with fine remembrance pointing out what happened where about 25 years before. there is this part that i told friends over and over again: bailed out from his us navy plane, dieter becomes a pow of the vietcong. blindfolded for the greater part of the days, he is being dragged through the southeast asian jungle for miles and miles - on bare feet. tortured, insulted, disorientated, hungered and covered with infectuous wounds, they arrive in a small, friendly village to spend the night. the next morning, after walking for several hours, dieter discovers someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. that is it. he can take no more. he starts to cry, as a result of complete exhaustion. the vietcong men react surprised. dieter manages to explain what happened. immediately, the group returns to the village and starts searching for the person that stole the ring. they find the man, immediately chop of his finger and return the ring to dieter. - the movie is full of these mind boggling and surprising situations. the immense cultural differences, the clash of east and west, the fear of the unknown (i.e. all that stands for america on the one hand, the asian jungle and his secrets on the other) can be sensed the entire movie. back problems? that's because you sat at the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't notice.

i was truly and wonderfully surprised at "o' brother, where art thou?" the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting, so then i came across this. i came home and as i watched i became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud. the coen's have made a magnificiant film again. but i think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. the second time, now that you know them, you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you. i strongly would reccomend anyone seeing this because if you are not, you are truly missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10

i originally saw this several years ago while i was sitting on the couch and got stuck watching it on hbo. with the remote out of my reach i decided to go with it and was awaiting a miserable movie that i had been avoiding for a year. so it started off and i wasn't very optimistic about it, but after about ten minutes i found myself laughing. the complete opposite as i was expecting. the comedy was smart, the acting pretty good considering, the cast worked very well together, and the story (though slightly awkward and fake) was actually quite entertaining.three convict brothers manage to escape their sentence and eventually go in search of their fortune. the movie is set in the 1930's. so along the way, they encounter a number of funny and interesting charatcers. all have a different story or achievement they are striving for. really the majority of the movie may seem random. some may say it was pointless and boring, but if you look for the smart comedy (and occasionally stupid) that is integrated into the movie, i'm sure you'll enjoy this one.i liked the performances given by george clooney, john turturro, and tim blake nelson. all of them did very well in their roles, an they worked great together. but to finish this off, "o brother, where art thou?" is a smart, funny, and a movie adventure that i wouldn't let pass up.

i thought this movie was great! i saw this when it came out in the theaters so i do not remember all the details. i remember it being based on homer's tale on odysseus. names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale. i found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it. i really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the romeo and juliet with clair danes.i will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors.

about the discussion on the south, the rednecks and the hillbillies... well, i am from the south: argentina, near the south pole to be exact. is this southern enough? seriously, some stories are universal. we have never been to greece, nor lived the classic period of homer, but he speaks to us today. so does shakespeare and dante. and stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like "o brother". besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too! and our own depression era (ever heard of argentina during year 2001?), our politicians and racism, our gentle souls just like delmar and tommy... i simply loved this movie, folks. despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (and please forgive my errors in english, i tried my best)ps: i believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase: when delmar asks george nelson what does he do for a living, while handling him the machine gun...

the first time i saw this movie, it didn't seem to go anywhere. when i watched it a second time though, it made a lot more sense. give it a chance, watch it more than once, there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it. the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline. the combination of clooney's leading role blends well with turturro and nelson's supporting acts. john goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. the soundtrack is great as well. this movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.

this film makes clooney. all his films combined before this have all been based on the same character. this film he transcends his previous body of work and proves his capability as a top notch actor. the soundtrack defeats most one-handedly. the brothers have truly made a classic. one to own and watch repeatedly.

my husband received dvd of obwat for christmas and it was the best gift we received! we watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times!the scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding!we also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily!if anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it!the characters are hilarious , charming , and their facial expressions are too funny to describe!i have always been a fan of george clooney but now i am also a fan of tim blake nelson(delmar ) and john turturro (pete)and am now looking for them in other movies! you gotta see this movie!!!

the coen brothers have done it again. three depression era convicts(george clooney, john turturro and tim blake nelson)escape a mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted ulysses everett mcgill. holly hunter plays his estranged wife. turturro and nelson are flawless stumblebums. also in the cast are john goodman and charles durning.dan tyminksi provides the singing voice for george clooney on "i am a man of constant sorrow", the soggy bottom boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features alison krauss, ralph stanley, the whites, john hartford, the cox family and gillian welch. toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. you'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is.

i was into the movie right away. i've seen the other coen movies, with the exception of raising arizona, and i've noticed that each of their movies has a color. fargo is gray/white, lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.the bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away. soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music. it's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life. enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.now, about the prison escapees. i don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys. clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.go see this as soon as possible. i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level. for some reason, the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.you'll love it too, i promise. i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.

this was the best film i saw in the year 2000. the cohen brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.it's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. of course, there's lot of cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.the big surprise for me was that clooney is so good. but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blake-nelson. but the rest of the cast is superb too.a film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. thats a very unlikely combination. but it's exactly what this picture is.

having seen most of the coen brothers previous films i expected something different and slighty off centre. obwat is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as mississippi. it is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. george clooney winning me over completely with his clark gable-ish looks and character. having only ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line cameo, i am now a fan. more comedy please george.john tuturro and tim blake nelson ably assist, especially nelson. if ever "the simpsons" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play cletus the slack-jawed yokel. i don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. my special favorite is stephen root as the blind radio station man.great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by clooney that i am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern us enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie i've see so far this century. the only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the dvd and a dvd player to play it on....it's that good!

i have walked out of a coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. the two best examples of that are the big lebowski and fargo. lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that i had to like it. on the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. still, i liked the film and now own a copy of it. fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes i wasn't sure why i was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless i was. there were many seemingly strange characters in fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. that is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. and that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (i own a copy of this film too) the coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. but if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. that is what is quite exceptional about o brother where art thou? this is a film that is out there. i mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. i reviewed the film shaft this past summer and in it i said that shaft was an okay film that i have seen a thousand times before. but you can not say that about a coen brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.this film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what i can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, kkk, lynch mobs and so on. there are obviously many references to homer's odyssey in here as well, but i wouldn't know that because i have never read homer's odyssey or even knew one thing about it. every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, i can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. there were times when again, as is usual for a coen film, i wasn't sure why i was entertained or laughing, but i was.this is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. he has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.i like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are coen cronies. it was nice to see goodman again. it was nice to see hunter and especially turturro who seems to have a place in every coen film. it's too bad they didn't find a place for steve buscemi but that is a different story all together. but back to clooney. the man just has charisma. he is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. his work here is quite awesome and i really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. i didn't really enjoy the film at first. i found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. there were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. but then the film began to grow on me. it took a while but it did grow on me. i don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and i am giving it a 8.5. but the reason that i do recommend this film is for one reason only.every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. most films have been recycled in some form or another. not the coen's films. they have not been recycled and if they have i don't know about it. that is reason enough to see something that they put out. originality counts for a lot in my books. the coens are original and they are good. and that is not common in todays cinema. enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!

not being a fan of the coen brothers or george clooney, anyone can see the skepticism i took into the theater. once again, someone in hollywood dares to create something different. this time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) coens doing "their thing" to one of the great works in literary history. who would've ever thought homer had this in mind? i don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library. it is one of those films that you can watch over and over. the story is brilliantly written. clean and entertaining, with a couple of gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by clooney, turturro, nelson, and a brief but hilarious holly hunter. being born in mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. they even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. you are not doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!

the coen brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. though it is based on "the odyssey," the ancient work of homer, you do not have to have read "the odyssey" to be able to follow the story. the brothers coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! the soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. george clooney is magnificent as the grease haired everett ulysses mcgill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. o brother, where art thou is easily the best coen film to date as well as clooney's best effort. clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is tim blake nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a best film nod.

thank goodness for the coen brothers. their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. i had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so i went to this one instead. by the time it began, i had forgotten what movie i was there to see. i was surprised in more ways than one. this movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. the writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by george clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. it can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the odyssey or not. i can't remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever. i've seen others i would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe "oh brother," but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. you can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. and the coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. it's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.

the knowledge is a typical british comedy for the period. to someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a london cabby the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces.the knowledge however comes into its own for knowledge boys like myself or their wife's who know what these poor individuals are going through. and find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters.

as someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of north london in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion, this film immediately appealed. throw in my interest in what london was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of tv heaven! on paper the film ticked all the right boxes, and having just watched "the knowledge" the actual movie itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations.visually, i was surprised how different london looked back then (i lived in islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). it truly came across as grimy, tatty and down-at-heel. london may still have bad housing estates, but the general feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and pleasant nowadays (based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories).as for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to nigel hawthorne as the vampire. absolutely brilliant! he acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total straight-faced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the knowledge boys as he puts them through test after test.all in all this was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that i find endlessly fascinating. but even if you're not especially interested in london circa 1979, you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of "the knowledge".

i first saw "the knowledge" during a thames television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new. i enjoyed it very much along with danger uxb.that a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it's originality and the quality of the performances by the cast.i looked for a dvd copy here in the u.s.a. and found none. i finally gambled and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code. so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy.

i must have seen this on the television when it was first broadcast some decades ago. i thought it was brilliant then, and as i remember so much of it now i may have been right. while i have lived in and around london i cannot call myself a londoner and do not know it at all well - who does other than taxi drivers? once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn-able and rise to the status of demigods, then the rest is sheer joy. the characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse, and so differently affected by the events of the film. don't think this is a documentary - it is pure drama, and the knowledge is one of the characters. i have never seen anything like this film, before or since. watch it!

just to correct something in a previous review here, i don't believe this film is only for people who know london, it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments. jack rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who, by going though this gruelling knowledge test, gain some measure of self-knowledge.i think it's one of the most perfectly-written dramas i've seen: technically it's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it's also joyous in how it involves you. at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it's vitally important to you. you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who don't. especially one whose downfall, without giving anything anyway, will make your hands fly to your face.also just as a point of fact, nigel hawthorne's character, mr burgess, is called the vampire, not dracula. you don't need to know this, i'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen this, you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail.i hope you get to see it.william

i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd. despite being a 'tv movie' and shot on 16mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'london cabbie', along with their foibles and family commitments. even the most hapless of candidates, 'titanic' with his uncommunicative wife, it was possible to see how jack rosenthal was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic snippet of london life into an entertaining 90 minutes.originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford (pun intended), the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael elphic, nigel hawthorne, jonathan lynn, lesley joseph and maureen lipman (mrs rosenthal) meant mick may have had top billing, but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents.even 15 years after its 1991 release, it is still as fresh as ever!

"flesh" is hard to describe with a solid summary because, well, there basically isn't a plot. the film pretty much just shows the day in the life of a hustler named joe (joe dallesandro, who is in the underrated louis malle picture "black moon") as he makes his rounds, sleeping and modeling around to cash in the bucks to pay for his wife's lover's abortion.not much, and since the film is quite a lengthy eighty-nine minutes, you would think that "flesh" would be a slow-moving and boring hour and a half. you think wrong. the film is made up of improv, no screenplay and the angles of the film are pretty on-the-spot as well, yet there is some kind of truth beneath every frame that gives the film its dementedly entertaining vibrancy. everything makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to joe in this one day. he meets a regular john that is obviously lying when saying he wants to see joe again, a photographer who talks so much that it bores joe to tears, two drag queens who read out of tabloid magazines as joe receives head from a mousy-voiced addict who mumbles on later about how she wants to get a breast lift, an old friend of joe who reads male-on-male rape stories to him, and then a final scene with his wife and her lover that eerily echoes the scene at the start of the film (one of the best openings to a film i have seen in quite some time) ¬ñ and tells completely what the film is overall philosophically about.it's astounding how the film's messages and styles feel almost timeless, even though it's set in 1960s new york city, in real time, in real place, and is filmed like an obvious independent flick from that era. it's certainly not a film that could be made today, which adds on to its delicious mystique.fueled by unexpected jump cuts; and absent of a score to advance its images ¬ñ "flesh" is about as raw, gritty as a film about male prostitution in the 60s can get.

a heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. this is the hunk of naked meat that is "little joe", a new york hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child. the film follows a day in his life, after he's woken from sleep by his wife demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing - be a breadwinner. but the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new girlfriend's abortion. we certainly aren't in the traditional family unit here...after playing with his child, joe hits the streets to cruise for johns. the clients come thick and fast: the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they "work well together", the old english classical scholar who pays $100 to see joe pose like an ancient greek athlete; the female topless dancer who blows joe then boasts about being raped; the ageing gym bunny who doesn't think that what he and joe do together is queer. after a hard day's work, joe returns home exhausted, only to be put down by his wife and the girlfriend. he goes back to sleep as they harp and undermine him.flesh is fascinating as it takes what is a traditional classical mainstream structure - it has an inciting incident (the money for the abortion) and set-up, a confrontation and a resolution (albeit a very downbeat one), even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal, and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the day to day routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary to themselves but extraordinary to most "mainstream" people. it all seems very authentic and natural - it's hard to see the acting, the actors are so fully being their roles - but yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning artifice - a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue. director morrissey carefully plants every incident, every encounter around his theme of human flesh become packaged commodity but with such cunning slight of hand that you almost don't notice him doing it. the wife "packages" joe's sexual organ, the old englishmen laments a long gone order of classical beauty which created art and poetry from human fleshly beauty, the transvestite friends of the stripper package themselves as women whilst reading a hollywood magazine in which "real" women are packaged as products; the gym bunny buys joe's friendship and affection, thinks artificial porn is real and can't tell, as we can't, that joe is performing his friendship and intimacy for the cash. the film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism but what we might as well be dealing with here is fine art or an early example of concept art.the genius - a word not lightly used - of morrissey was to find a way of taking warhol's arty pretensions to film-making, which were interesting sure but boring as hell, and making them into saleable products which remain amongst the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made - commercial cans labelled "flesh" and "trash" and "heat" with a product label - "andy warhol" - which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself. yet just as you reel from morrissey's cynicism, you are spellbound by his ability to still maintain the highest of standards and depth of meaning. the constant what seem like camera flashes continually draw attention to the filmic nature of what one is witnessing, yet you get drawn into the illusion all the same - flesh is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to ever spellbind an audience.

after visiting the kimbell museum in forth-worth, texas, usa, enjoying the art and the architecture (also of the adjacent modern art museum), and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady, i purchased this a propos dvd with rather high expectations¬Ö and was not disappointed in the least.the thematic approach, dramatic tension, revealing interviews, archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic louis i. khan.the documentary begins: contemplative classical music plays, archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed, blurring letters symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape ¬ó a journey ¬ó, focus and out of focus, the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper. nathanial khan reads from the front page of the new york times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best american architect alive and his death announced. "when i first read that obituary, i have to admit, i was looking for my own name. i was his child too, his only son. i didn't know my father very well. he never married my mother and he never lived with us (¬Ö) he died when i was eleven."so years later, this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure, but who's secretive personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about it."for years, i struggled to be satisfied with the little pieces of my father's life i've been allowed to see, but it wasn't enough. i needed to know him. i needed to find out who he really was. so i set out on a journey, to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there. it would take me to the other side of the world, looking for the man who left me with so many questions."so the documentary is two-fold, by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renown architect, we get to know: 1) his ideas, buildings and the architectural perspective and 2) his families, coworkers, people's life he affected and the human perspectivethe dvd also offers added insight with a q&a with the writer/director and additional footage that includes such great louis i. khan quotes as "everything that everybody says is the truth. it's their truth. it might not be factual." and "a good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all."this movie is a journey of discovery. self-discovery and discovery of a man, a great man, yet a human, imperfect like all of us. we get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son, but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging.by key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacity. we slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments.brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.

"don't torture a duckling" is one of the coolest italian horror films i've ever seen, and i've seen my share. to call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. it's more of a straight horror movie.complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel. the setting is perfect: an old italian village. the music is ridiculously perfect. the finale is genuine and original.after seeing "don't torture a duckling" you really have to wonder how fulci's later stuff got so off beat. i like all his stuff, but he strayed. maybe he figured he already did it...because with this film, he hits the bullseye.i'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that dario argento owns the giallo genre. fulci beats him with this one. 10 out of 10, kids.

don't torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo diversion for lucio fulci. unlike other subgenre heavyweights like mario bava and dario argento, fulci takes a decidedly gritty, grounded, and socially perceptive approach to the giallo narrative in this film. there is nothing glamorous about the child murders and borderline pedophilia (a gutsy subplot for 1972) going on here, and fulci wisely shoots with a staid and lugubrious eye, avoiding flash, melodrama, and directorial histrionics. the proceedings are punctuated by gory and instantly mind-searing set pieces that are bolstered even further by fulci's jarring sense of realism¬ó the deeply disturbing "witch killing" scene in particular, with its bald-faced brutality, feels like a snuff film. composer riz ortolani bookends these carnage-filled scenes with ferocious reverberating string blasts.the film is capped by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion wherein theology, morality, fanaticism, and superstition collide. it is a deeply effective ending that has the capacity to leave the viewer in a befuddled and disarmed torpor.fulci couldn't have picked a better location for this film. don't torture a duckling was photographed in and around the ancient city of matera, italy. as matera continues to modernize to this day (highlighted by its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one), it is grappling with its unesco-sponsored reputation as a receptacle for mysterious paleolithic ghosts. the anxieties of the real-life materani are reflected by the characters in the film, who, wearing their christianity on their sleeves, fretfully confront any exotic fringe tradition (namely witchcraft) that strays outside of the norm.interestingly enough, matera was also used as a stand-in for jerusalem in mel gibson's the passion of the christ. if anything, this adds even more potency to fulci's message. catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonant combination.

what a surprise this film was. i've seen a good few of fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. he also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. the dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'manhattan baby'.the photography in this film is fantastic. a strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered. a scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence. what went wrong lucio? perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film, and it slowly went downhill after that.

easily lucio fulci's most respected film, "don't torture a duckling" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. terror befalls a small italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. was it the creepy hermit? the spastic voodoo witch? one of the hookers? the rich girl? someone else? contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - i consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards). in no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers. fulci proves himself fully capable of dishing out one hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with childing killing, black magic, and of course a nice full set o' knockers... though i'm particularly more fond of fulci's "lizard in a woman's skin" and "new york ripper", "don't torture a duckling" dominates the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery!

i have not read the novel from which the film is based on. so i cannot comment on what is missing or if there were changes made.as i stated above, i had a wonderful experience watching the kite runner.. i find that when i see films about other cultures than ours here in the usa,i learn how other peoples live & exist.the actors in this movie are from afghanistan & other countries in that area. there are 3 young children in this near epic movie in there first roles, they were marvelous.the scenes that was supposedly in kabul were shot in various parts of china, i assume that the area is similar to the actual places in the book.mark foster directed & he did finding nevrrland, he has created the same magic here.all aspects of production are first rate.i found this a better movie than those nominated & won oscars.the film is sub-titled , it is very clear to read. it has a proper pg-13 rating. spoiler alert--- the child rape scene is very well handled.i cannot however give this a 4 star rating as the general plot & story line we have seen many, many times, non-the-less this is a very worthwhile movie to watch..ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)

one of the best and most inspirational movies about a different culture i've seen in years. tragic and touching. worth the watch. maybe a few times. we all know how brutal children can be. i know from my own and my brothers experiences as children and this movie hit the nail on the head. perfectly! the kite running is amazing and i need to do research on the validity of that event. even though it is done in cgi it is still amazing and very interesting. to maneuver a kite like that with a single string seems impossible but they make it believable. anyway this movie has many twists and turns that are, i'm sure to many, probably easy to figure out but they hit me before i could. which makes a great movie for me! when you figure out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes it kind of ruins it. but this one does it so smoothly that it's hard to guess it even when it happens...i'm a guy and i don't mind saying that the tears were flowing at more than one point in this movie.

based on the best selling novel by khaled hosseini, the kite runner is a story of friendship, betrayal, and the struggle for redemption. set in afghanistan prior to the soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of taliban rule, all of the elements are present for great drama but, under the direction of marc forster (finding neverland), the film lacks the kind of searing emotional impact that makes for a memorable experience, though it is entertaining, well acted, and occasionally moving.set in 1978 in kabul but filmed in kashgar, china because of the dangers in afghanistan, the friendship that opens the film between two young boys is very real, though they are miles apart in social and economic circumstances. 12-year-old amir (zekiria ebrahimi) lives in posh surroundings with his wealthy and educated father baba, played by the great homayoun ershadi, although his wealth seems a bit incongruous in one of the poorest countries in the world. though baba is a loving father, he confesses to rahim khan (shaun toub), his friend and business associate, that amir is too soft and that there is "something missing with that boy". the family has a servant, ali (nabi tanha) who dotes on his every need and whose son hassan (ahmed khan mahmoodzada) is amir's best friend.the two are separated not only by class but also by ethnicity. amir, a burgeoning writer, is a member of the pashtun majority while hassan is a hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). though we learn little about their traditions or social situation, they are bound together by their love of kite flying, a popular sport in kabul and by amir's reading afghan folk stories to hassan who is illiterate. the annual kite-flying competition to the boys is a big event in their lives and the cgi effects are breathtaking. the kite strings are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kite string can cut down the other kites in the sky. hassan is the kite runner who has an uncanny ability to locate the fallen kites and bring them to amir as a trophy. after amir wins the important contest, however, a sad event occurs that will shape the rest of his life.bullies, led by the older assef (elham ehsas) who later appears as a ruthless taliban leader, attack hassan because he is a hazara and brutally rape him (off camera) while amir is too frightened to try and prevent it. unable to confront his perceived lack of courage (though one must wonder what if anything he could have done to help hassan), guilt becomes the driving force in his relationship with hassan and their friendship becomes strained. in one incident, amir throws pomegranates at hassan as if begging him to fight back and punish him for his passivity but hassan doesn't take the bait, continuing to be loyal in spite of his friend's cowardice. when amir urges his father to dismiss the servants and accuses hassan of stealing his watch, hassan admits to the theft even though he is innocent. eventually, circumstances force ali and hassan to leave out of shame. when the russians invade afghanistan, baba and amir also leave, fleeing to pakistan and then to fremont, california where the story picks up years later.baba is forced to work at a gas station and to sell trinkets at an open-air market while amir (abdul salam yusoufzai), seemingly going through the motions of living, studies to become a writer at the local community college. after he falls in love and marries soraya (atossa leoni), the daughter of a kabul general, amir finally publishes his first novel, a season of ashes and things look very positive. when amir receives a call from rahim khan asking him to visit him in pakistan telling him "there is a way to be good again", the specter of guilt that has haunted him all of his life beckons amir to go home. he returns to pakistan and, with great risk, goes back to an afghanistan now controlled by the taliban to confront the demons of his past and to discover a startling secret in the process.the kite runner is a sensitive film that deals with the internal pain that comes from knowing that you were not true to your best instincts and allows for the possibility of moving beyond shame to a new level of responsibility. it also does not hide the pain caused to afghanistan by wars and revolution, a pain that is perhaps represented by the suffering hassan. unfortunately, it reduces complex situations to the level of good guys and villains and distorts what actually happened, exonerating the u.s., who engaged in anti-government covert operations within the country, from any responsibility for the disastrous war that left over one million dead and millions more disabled. though we are inspired by the outstanding child actors and moved by the freedom that kite flying represents, the kite runner relinquishes its power when it attempts to substitute melodrama for history.

this is a film that left me breathless........ wanting to learn more of the afghan history and traditions. with todays "evil doer" mantra clouding reality, it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.casting was impeccable, the scenery simply marvelous. the acting was first rate and the fact that the academy overlooked this (except it's music) is unforgivable.the script is wonderful and such and emotional journey. provoking an "ugly cry" from this watcher.a film worth watching a second and third time.

i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan, a culture i know very little about. i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint. i watched this with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it. they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film. it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over. you feel for the characters and their plights. i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture. there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.

at 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. from here we follow six separate students; marcus, melody, luke, steven, sarah and sean. each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one.after losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director murali k. thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. if you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view.with heavy and hard subject matter, thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis's. sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. the factor on thalluri's talent is his subtlety. he respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. it verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this.2:37 has a distinctive similarity to gus van sants film elephant. while the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. like sant, thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth, to show each characters interaction from different perspectives. a defining point to elephant was its ethereal ambiance. with spare conversation, little development of characters, and the long tracking shots, sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread. while there resides this dread in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level sant couldn't reach. as time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster.the real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide, foretold at the very beginning. the hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion. though many films that have shown suicide, gloss over the act or romanticizes the act. thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution. with unknowns in the leads and their first major roles; teresa palmereach, frank sweet, joel mackenzie, marni spillane, charles baird and sam harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers.compelling and revetting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film.

i have to confess i fell into the cynical trap of believing that australians couldn't make drama unless it meant a lot of crying, and i am an australian. sad, isn't it? while this movie does involve crying, its not dramatic crying, its honest emotion shining through.also, this film is a whodunnit. i knew what the final outcome was going to be when i started watching this, so i tried to guess who it was that was going to do it. i missed by a mile.i was stunned when i found out the director, murali thulluri was only around 21 when he made this film. i would love to shake his hand. he knows how to make a movie. i hope he has more coming.all of the characters we meet before the main title credit (about 12 minutes in) is an anti hero. all of them troubled in their own way and all of them as selfish as the next one. even when they are sympathetic.the saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are difficult to watch) is the final scene where we're formally introduced to the real main character and we're told of their nephew. that scene made me cry.my faith in australian drama has been restored. we're masters at comedy, but i was getting bored with comedy.murali, if you happen to check this out, you touched my soul and for that i can only thank you.

being featured at the 2006 cannes film festival and gaining quite some fame, this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama. it's about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school. everything's circling around a suicide - shown at the very beginning to some extent - that happens at 2:37pm. the characters are somehow all connected with each other. what moves them is described via short interview sequences, strictly shot in b/w. the characters are well written, the acting is intriguing (especially teresa palmer as melody and frank sweet as marcus are discoveries).let's stick to the movies' technique. that's what really impressed me. there rarely are cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in gus van sants' elephant. some scenes are presented more often than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). this surely evokes a slowly developing, but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally. the colours are vibrant, somehow unfitting considering the tough plot - but that's nothing less than a clever contrast, a disturbing 'everything's fine thing'. the use of lighting is adequate all the time, underlining the characters' actual mood. and finally, there are decent placements of music.2:37 somehow itches you from the very beginning. it does not compromise nor does it serve laughter. it rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments. this movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices. there ain't nobody who's not to handle some kind of neurosis, even the depicted minor parts (e.g. the teachers) seem to be in some state of disorder. and that is what keeps this movie from being really good. its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones. there is no: friendship, love, smiling, truth, passion. there is: faking, humiliation, despair, sickness and beating up. it's like being hit in the face real hard all the time, but you are numb after the first hour. this flick keeps on hitting you, until it reveals something quite instructive in the end.for being sensitively and superbly acted: 9. for being technically innovative and original: 9. for being unidimensional: 3.makes a solid 7 out of 10.

i saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic. it does well in portraying issues that the average high school student is subjected to. i left the movie feeling stunned and saddened and yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audiences regarding these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression).its a fantastic aussie film.go see it.support it.learn from it.

good show, really good acting, and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially since, essentially, it's two people in a room. it doesn't race through like many modern films, but doesn't drag, either. bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the "now" of her character, which is still involved and not going back on her 'career' choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep, self-examination of her soul...brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, meekness, and class to pull off 'buddy' very well. a bit grainy on the film quality, but it fits the tone of the story. could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things, but definitely worth watching.

all those that identify this as a simple rip-off of 'elephant' - are there no other comments that you can make towards the movie on its own merits as an individual film (regardless of its apparent similarities to other movies).all those that question the validity of the movie - in terms of its stereotypical characters (the obligatory gay, the jock, the disabled kid, etc) - i'm not sure how long it has been since you were at school - but regardless of how amateurish the acting may be - the happenings that go one are surprisingly close to what may actually happen.and all those that disregard the film as being so simple: just six teenagers with the regular teenage angst that pushes one over the edge... did anyone stop to think, and take notice that the girl who took her life wasn't actually one of those six!! as one comment points out - she had screen time of maybe 2min max (excluding the final scenes). i think the point of the film is not only to make an issue of teenage angst, and how far it can take someone - but also that it is no apparently obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act (suicide)...

yes, 2:37 is in some ways a rip off from gus van sants elephant. it's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. yes, it's full of clich√©s, but that's life. you just can't deny that creepy nerds, disabled persons or popular students who, despite their popularity, do have problems are existing in the real world.but that's not, what this film is all about. it's not about life in highschool. it's not about the misery of life itself.if you look beneath the surface, beneath the soap-like social relationships that are shown, you will find some gripping, thought-provoking criticism of our society.why are people committing suicide? do we really understand their motives? or are we just trying to understand, after its already too late? and why is it always someone, you would never have expected it to be?this movie doesn't answer this question, but it raises it. and it does so in a very intense way. all the way it keeps you guessing, whose blood it might be, that you see at the very beginning. you are following the paths of some students, all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives, just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale.did you know who it would be? or were you caught by surprise, like in real life?the message is verbalized by one of the surviving kids in the end. we are always so fixed on our own problems, we forget to see those of others. there might be someone, a colleague, a friend, who does not want to live anymore. but, if you don't open your eyes, you'll never know until its too late.this movie delivers well. it might have some flaws, but they don't matter anymore, when its over. either you see a reflection of society, or you are blind for reality.

many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isn't "realistic." how can it not be considered realistic. they feel that say the incest part isn't easy to relate to, that it isn't common. i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur. many of them aren't going to come out and say it, and mostly these are victims. also, many people are gay, and are still in the closest, because no matter how much they would like it to be, they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned. and tell me, how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder? i bet a lot, and although pregnancy isn't from incest most of the time, its still easy to relate to. who can't relate to being an outcast or being bullied? that happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as marcus. being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to. so there are a lot of things to relate to. more than the rest though, no matter how popular you may get, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, not noticed, or overlooked such as the suicide victim, how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie? i find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others, but i would like to think of it as important. it an interesting way of showing that suicide happens, and to be aware. it comes from the people that don't show their unhappy thoughts, its very surprising. the people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to, but when you hear of suicide, who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds.the ending surprised me, i wasn't expecting it to be the girl that until the end, was mostly an extra in the scenes, not even introduced. the story, even in its description, says its about 6 teenage lives, when in fact it was 7. my only real disappointment was that it wasn't one of the characters that we got to learn about, it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick. until i thought more. it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise, since thats what suicides are like. plus, who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other.though this movie has some bad points, most movies have a few, but i would recommend this movie, as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide, and violence and profanity shown in this film.

first of all, i must say i really enjoy watching this movie. the way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly, and its one of those movies that really makes you think.spoiler!!!!the fact that the the girls who kills herself, is the one you don't notice, that fact made me wonder abit, since thats why she commits suicide in the movie.. the director impressed me with that, making a movie that shows the plot to the audience and also deliver the message that not a lot of people would have seen it coming. some people might start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did it, but no one noticed her, just like no one who watched the movie did either... don't know about you, but i did not guess that it would be her who committed suicide.. did you ??regards jan

i just saw this film at the sidewalk film festival in birmingham, al, which was actually a really fun festival, and was blown away by it. it was the best movie i saw all day by a long shot. a school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. it's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. story stems from real life occurrences, ripped straight from the headlines. raw, blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. the film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity. definitely not suitable for kids. too depressing for some people's tastes. definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.

i think this film has to be one of the most moving, and heartbreaking films of recent times.the film basically starts off with a suicide in a school toilet. u don't see who it is, then from there it goes to the beginning of the day, and we get to know 6 characters, and they are going through some pretty heavy things, anyway eventually one of them will commit suicide.i've been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years now, and never in a film have i seen such an accurate portrayal of what 'really' goes on in school life.the film is shot beautifully, and sounds incredible.the ending is so shocking, and so what one would not expect, it is something that will haunt me for days to come. this is definitely one to watch.i think the fact that the director/writer was in school only a few years ago is a major contributing factor to the raw honesty expressed in the film. the film is shot in two separate 'modes' if you will. firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama, but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections, where we get to know the characters back stories, and their deepest, darkest thoughts.you keep wondering, who is it going to be (who commits suicide) and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind, until bam, it hits you in the face in the final five minutes. i am all over the place in my writing, but i've just seen it at a media screening in australia, and i am still in a bit of shock. it's one of the best australian films i have seen in recent years.

i think that this film is one of the funniest films i have ever seen. i think debbie reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and glenn ford is perfect. there is not a dull moment in the film and debbie looks beautiful as always. the story is about a showgirl maggie(debbie reynolds) who meets a penniless soldier joe (glenn ford). she takes an instant dislike to him but after he accidentally tears her dress, he returns it to her on the condition that she goes on one date with him. they end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss. joe and maggie move to spain and find they have nothing in common but physical attraction, so maggie proposes that for one month they live but not as man and wife which means that joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with maggie, much to joe's frustration.a hilarious plot and a wonderful film. not to be missed.

this is a charming little film, which like many of it's kind, derives it's charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue.glenn ford (as always) shines through in a great comedic performance as the penniless air force officer, married after just one day to gold-digging showgirl debbie reynolds.after the one initial wedding night of passion and a life changing move to spain, the two quickly realise that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other they have nothing at all in common.however when she decides to give their marriage a go, it is on the understanding that it for one month trial period only and sex is most definitely not on the cards.ford is also falling foul to his new $40,000 lincoln futura concept car (the future batmobile) which he wins in a raffle the same night he meets his new wife.the car is bringing him unwanted attention from the air force, who see it as a vulgar display of american wealth and is bringing suspicions of corruption and embezzlement etc. it is also putting him in the 80-90% tax bracket and as penniless as he is he now faces a tax bill of over $17,000. not the kind of money you should be owing when your wife is the kind of person who spends over a $1,000 on one shopping trip.even when he tries to sell it it brings him misfortune as selling so much as a cigarette or a pair of stockings to the natives is punishable by court martial, so you can imagine that a $17,500 transaction practically has the firing squad polishing their rifles.his potential purchaser is also causing him problems as he is a disgustingly handsome bull-fighting spanish nobleman, who's interest in the car has lead to a stronger interest in ford's wife, made worse by the fact that a rich jet-set lifestyle is being offered and is what she has sought for so long.with ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love rival mounting, coupled with reynolds' materialistic attitude and flirtatious behaviour around the enamoured spaniard serving to drive the wedge deeper between the two, it seems that their whirlwind relationship is destined to end.but can whatever love and attraction that threw these two love birds together in the first place, shine through and keep them together?not the best example of this genre of film, but due to the watchable performances by it's principles and the enjoyable plot line, it is certainly a fine one.

hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. what else can you ask for in a film? this is my all-time, number one favorite movie. ever since i was a little girl, i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.the clich√© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst (harold) and andy tennant (melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch? don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies, dressed up as hari krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! the clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.a word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. but nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that "it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play."

if you're a "child of the eighties" like me, you probably remember this 1981 disney movie--one of disney's first pg-rated films, and michael j. fox's screen debut. i can remember watching this film over and over on hbo when i was on middle school, and i only recently found a very old copy of it, since disney stopped producing the movie several years ago. needless to say, this is a real fun movie to watch. five college teams decipher clues in an evening race around los angeles, trying to reach the finish line first. watch for the cameo from paul reubens. from the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is a quintessential 1980s fun film that you'll love.

there is no denying that this is a bad movie. the acting isn't great, likewise the script, acting and direction. still, i cannot wait until its 2/23/99 video release from anchor bay. everyone knows there are several bad movies out there that have a tremendous appeal to them. this one tops my list.

a classic 80's movie that disney for some reason stopped making. i watched this movie everyday when i was in like 6th grade. i found a copy myself after scouring video stores. well worth it though. one of my all time favs

i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old. who can forget some of the best lines in film history? --- johnny's fat boy burgers!! johnny's fat boy burgers!! and look between the giant melons! i used to wish i could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this. it's an all-time fave and i'm happy to hear that it's out on video! i'm positive that this is where mtv got its original premise for the road rules series.

midnight madness is the ultimate scavenger hunt movie for all time. michael j fox and paul reubens make respective pre- fame appearances. laughs abound everywhere and the intrigue of who will emerge victorious at the end of the great all-nighter will keep you on the proverbial edge of your seat. a true must see!

as many of the other comments i have read have noted, i fell in love with this movie when i was a kid. my sister and i had a copy of the movie on beta (before vhs) that we wore out. of course it didn't help when our parents sold the betamax at a garage sale. since then we have been trying to find a copy. i, like another commentator, did eventually locate a rental copy at a local video store. the owner would not part with the copy after any number of attempts to beg, bribe, and cry my way to owning the tape. good news! i bought a brand new, newly released, vhs copy of midnight madness for $9.99 on amazon.com two days ago!!!! finally, disney has wizened up. now, if they'll only rerelease song of the south... if you love the movie, grab it. if you haven't seen the movie, it's worth a check - totally stupid humor but a lot of fun (stephen furst is hilarious).

although it was dark, depressing, and at times hard to watch, you are alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog. it truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships. in addition, the soundtrack was amazing. the lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. jessica bohl is the best actress i have ever watched. her compelling and believable performance made the movie. it made me wonder if she really is a prostitute. who knows. anyway, the movie was very worth seeing. love, your sister! yeah, that's right....

still funny after all these years. midnight madness is good entertainment for all ages. it introduces michael j fox as a typical 15 year old trouble maker. melio and blaylak are by far the funniest characters in it and leon is perfectly cast as a wierdo game master. the budding romance between adam and the girl couldn't have been any cheesier. fagabeefe!!!!

midnight madness is a movie that is unfortunately highly underrated and unappreciated. with a flood of classic "edgy" teen/college movies, this one was forgotten. as a child i would watch this movie over and over again, luckily i had it on video. this movie shows a more tame, but most exciting side of the eighties. in the cynical society we live in this day and age, with drug abuse being the "coolest" thing, it's good to see, once in awhile, a fun, innocent movie that is midnight madness...that is if you can find it.

for a movie that was pg, this is one fun film. i grew up on watching this film over and over. its really fun, i don't know how today audience would react, but if you grew up on it, or loved the 80s, then this is a great film. stephen furst is great as harold, who, i think, is one of the best characters in the film. paul ruebens also pops in for about 10 minutes. i love nostalgia.

i taped this as a teenager in the mid 80s based upon the synopsis in the cable guide (the scavenger hunt aspect appealed to me), having no knowledge or expectations of the film. what a pleasant surprise when i viewed it! this was such a fun film and i remember watching it repeatedly. i thought that the concept was well executed, i enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups, and i thought that the scavenger hunt itself was quite clever. sometimes it seems that people have far too great expectations for movies. not all movies are going to have a weighty "message" or stellar acting, production values, or special effects. sometimes movies are just meant to entertain and be fun, and this one succeeds on both levels. it was so nice to read the comments from the actors who played the twins. i haven't seen this movie in years, but if i did i think i'd have just as warm and enthusiastic a reaction to it as i did as a teenager. even as i type this, snippets of the cheesey yet appropriate theme song are running through my head: "when midnight madness starts to get to you...it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do...!"

one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint.this movie has you guessing throughout, and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen. there are no bad guys or good guys, bechard makes sure of that. the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them, you care about what they have been through.bechard's use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of "fast food movies" and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives you.i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell. thank you gorman bechard for proving that false.run, don't walk, to see this movie.

this really is a movie that you need to see twice. when i first saw this film i was really drawn into the story. while the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room, the stories that buddy (nick drake, wonderful allusion) and daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world. through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels. the soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly, dark, lo-fi and intriguing. when you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending i have seen in a long time. i hope to see this movie find a distributor for the dvd so that it will be more accessible. great movie, you won't be disappointed.

i had actually considered investing in this movie when gorman was out drumming up funding. i loved most of the script but did not like the ending. gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be.seeing the completed movie i have to say i am amazed. reading the script i had not imagined the acting (and gorman's directing) would be as powerful and moving as it is here. the two leads did an amazing job. they were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars.now, for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don't read further as you need to see the movie first. (i actually wish i had never read the script just so i could have experienced the movie ending first hand.) ----------------------------- spoiler i have two main problems with the movie. first off, and i'm sure i mentioned this when i read the script, the wife should have died. if she were dead the ending would be much more believable. as it is, we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him 'years ago.' if she left him and he is still in love after so long he'd have to be seriously delusional. but he doesn't come across that way in the script. (there is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves.)plus, if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling, reciprocating love, and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable.however, i don't buy daphne doing what she does in the ending. i'd need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but believable due to bohl's performance) did what she did. the character is simply not cold enough. and if she did this out of some kind of love, or something else, then there is a whole piece of the movie/story missing.much of this movie is reminiscent of "sex, lies, and video tape." i think it could have been as popular if gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending. so watch the movie, enjoy the performance. and make up your own mind.

-surprisingly enjoyable movie -a group of thieves lead by mark wahlberg rob a gold safe in italy and thankfully for them the heist is successful and they get away with it without any big problems. before the group can celebrate however steve played by ed norton decides he want the gold all for himself and pulls a cout de' ta on the group and shoots one of the members. he and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead but luckily the group is not dead. a year later we get back into the story where the group has tracked down norton and decide to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the movie coming up with plans to steal back their gold and settle a score.-this was a surprise for me, it had all the makings to be a typical forgettable summer movie but it was actually memorable and really fun to watch. what i like is how smart and well thought out the plans in the movie are, and how the movie feels realistic. watching the trailer would make you think it was some mindless action movie but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done. the latter action scene is a very long 20 min. scene that has one of the best car chases ever done. i like how real the chase is and how everything is done old school style without the aid of cgi. me personally i enjoyed this car chase more than the cgi filled chase in "matrix 2". i remember watching music videos by director f. gary gray and always noticed how well made they were and thought he'd make a great filmmaker, turns out i was right as always and he proves it here. can't wait to see what he does with the sequel. -the actors do a decent job too with seth green being my favorite of the group. the other thing i loved was the excellent score by john powell, ever since i heard his score for "robots" this year i've been a fan of him and paying close attention to his music and the man is really good. he does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie musical clich√©'s and provides a very well done score. i haven't seen the original that this is based on so i can't really say how well it stacks up to that one.-so yeah this is a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the summer movie crap that comes out. has great characters, is funny as hell and has a amazing score by john powell. if you love heist movies then you'll love this one -you know if i was in the group they'd call me handsome mike

i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival (world premiere).a haunting, intimate portrait of loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.the acting of the two leads (jessica bohl & richard brundage) is excellent, and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.reminded me in theme of the works of atom egoyan (exotica) and raymond carver (where i'm calling from).the soundtrack (tywanna jo baskette, crooked fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.highly recommend the film and the soundtrack.

if you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place. it is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters. it is always hard for me to see mark walhberg as anything except marky mark. that image is burned in my mind forever. as an actor though he is pretty good. this movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns. i will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.

the italian job is a real blast to watch. it's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. it's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. it's just a fun movie. between watching the little mini coopers fly around the crowded streets of l.a. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by seth greene), i had a lot of fun watching this film.special kudos to the background music. they truly set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, i found it to be the classiest part of the film.8 out of 10. not awe-inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.barky

my reaction to this remake of "the italian job" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when i saw it; this is the first movie i saw after i had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. money was still tight, but i no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude i was feeling at the time was enormous. in consequence, my enjoyment of "italian job" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. still, i picked it up used on dvd a few weeks ago and watched it again, and i still enjoyed it immensely. i have never seen the original (though i have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. what initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - imo don davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. ij opens with a sly, witty, pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. and the whole movie is like this - i haven't heard this kind of ringing, chiming, pulsing soundtrack music since stewart copeland left the police and started doing soundtracks for movies like "rumble fish". there are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here, along with some pop song remakes that range from "all right" to "inspired". for people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight. on to the movie: i can take or leave mark wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. he's the weakest "major" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong, especially donald sutherland in a bit part. mos def, jason steadham, ed norton, seth green and charlize theron all turn in solid, fat-free performances. norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film), but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. my one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character "wrench", who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. his part seems to be shoehorned into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the "late walk on" nature of the character). if i were a cynical sort,i would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? nah, never happen...production values, camera work, stunts, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the "wrench" character, see above). the dialog has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (my favorite moment - when norton's character tells wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. wahlberg proceeds to cold cock norton with a right cross, and then asks him, "were you surprised??" hmmm, maybe you had to be there...) of course the movie requires a certain level of "suspension of disbelief" to work, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate la traffic via a laptop, etc), you'll have a fun ride. "the italian job": it's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else. it isn't good enough for an "8" but i'd give it a "7.5".

i enjoyed the movie very much. everything in the italian job is simple. an explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. this film is entertaining although it has no central idea. it is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. all the stunt work is gorgeous. from the speedboat chase in venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. the best boast chase i have ever seen. i like the mini coopers. the expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. the chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. they chased underground. i can say there was not a moment i was bored. mark wahlberg (charlie croker), charlize theron (stella bridger), donald sutherland (john bridger), jason statham (handsome rob), seth green (lyle), mos def (left ear) and edwin norton (steve) really did a good job. i like the actors in this film. i have seen a lot of heist movie but the italian job& is one of my favourites. a great hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. after all, i do love this kind of movie.

over the last few months, i have seen a lot of reviews for the italian job, many of them negative. the gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, for all its modernistic bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. look, people, it's just a fun movie. this is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the steady-moving pace of the film. like ocean's eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking (lucky for some of us). granted, "ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? the plot may have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be, and some of the dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? cool characters, mini coopers, big explosions, charlize theron. what more do you want? i think it's time to drop the fake roger ebert meets gene shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what f. gary gray has told the press a million times, this is not a remake!! my advice- if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother seeing the italian job. but, if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and/or want to see ed norton get jacked by a bunch of ukranians, go ahead. the bottom line, my fellow moviegoers, is: lighten up and have fun, dammit.

a few years ago i saw this remake of the sixties classic with the mini coopers for the first time and i remember liking it a lot. now, about two years later it was shown on television and i just wanted to know whether i would still like it as much as when i saw it in the cinema. well, the answer is yes.the movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in venice, italy. the plan is flawless and the execution perfect. they escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. but there is one problem they didn't take into account: someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. but all but one survive and they are out for revenge. one year later, in los angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...the story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. this is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. the action is very nice, the landscapes and venice are real eye-candy, the story is ok and the special effects are stunning. even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. i must admit that i really liked what i saw and i give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.

the greatest compliments to the other commentator here at imdb who asked himself why this series didn't "get stuck" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did.it is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued.i will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the robin hood legend.first of all, robert addie (gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever.nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. and at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of terry jones' history documentations about egypt, greece, rome, konstantinopel, the goths and barbarians, and the middle ages and crusades (...yes, the monthy python-terry jones):if you have seen those brilliant and funny jones-docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff carpenter, the writer of the robin of sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of john carpenter, who made "the thing", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us.the writer of "dick turpin", "catweazle" and the first two seasons of "robin of sherwood", called "kip" carpenter, is my movie overlord. he's better than all those others who criticize his "sword-and-sorcery" element or "defectiveness" (taken from the robin of sherwood webring) of this series (that i can not see) or have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now.that's why, when you get to know this "robin of sherwood" better, you'll be severe. you will at first loathe the third season. not only that: i did myself go thru this, and on top of it, i have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - despite the fact that praed, the actor of robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous canadian series called "the new adeventures of jules verne" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. praed went for money, and not for fame, he didn't stick with his gang and kin, i mean: as actors.actors who personally represent the afterwards "really", in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the robin-legend. the potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues.again, obligatory to say: a change of the main role was forced by praed's stupid decision of leaving robin of sherwood for a silly remake-series of the verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. still it is in some aspects a catastrophe.anyway: if one is informed about this, and that connery was maybe really advertised by his father, but that the young connery did not at all "chase praed away", how i prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. sad here is that the script was not anymore written by superman kip carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in "the witch of elsdon", or in "the king's fool", two episodes of the first series that is a) funny, b) historically educating and c) brilliantly acted. ==="don't trust the lion!"unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power, richard lionheart, as shown in ros and as in real history, was a greater authority than john or others, but used it only for his wicked idea of the crusade and the war against normandie in france. he slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of christians, muslims and jews in the "wholy" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty. on top of that, after his capture by the saracens (muslims) in the crusades, britain was squeezed out for his ransom, 100.000 marks (at that time, 11th century, comparable to approx. 30 billion - 30'000'000'000.- dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then he just visited england for a month to return to normandie (in france, where the norman invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode "the king's fool"). for this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for his capture, richard lionheart again "drains the country of money" (cited out of clive mantle's mouth, when he lectures robin in being critical with even the king). robin criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of richard's, he addresses richard himself, telling him "the poor gave everything to set you free, how can you ask more of them?" - richard: "...give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ...later, in private, richard orders the assassination of robin...so, the crusaders were the real "barbarians".p.s: already when i watched kostner in 91, i got upset, because after-wards, i found out in history course in school that richard was not that good just man as displayed by sean connery in his appearance at the end of "prince of the thieves". well, as terry jones would put it: it is a lie, a treacherous lie!" sean plays humorist and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of "robin of sherwood".again: praed is, according to my info up to now, the one who left sherwood for a stupid verne-series nobody with brains will ever remember or want to remember.

i watched this series on pbs back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so. very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. this is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted. you are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people. the villains are almost laughably evil, especially the sheriff of nottingham. man, i would love to beat the s--t out of that snotty little bastard. nicholas grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the sheriff. his whipping boy, sir guy, is equally hissable but is also pathetic. lots of murder and mayhem in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that nature. i noticed it got an award for children's television which is surprising. if i had kids, i would not let them watch this. outstanding use of locations in this show also. it is now on dvd, so go out and buy it.

this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending (or maybe a crying game surprise), and the best soundtrack i've probably ever heard...if that all make sense.the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere.) but from there, the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, daphne and buddy.they're lonely, mess-up, and boy do they talk about sex. daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting, some are quite funny (mr. chang) some disturbing (the harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what's going on, or what daphne is really feeling), and because i have a friend who used to escort, i might add, most seem quite real. you are alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. okay, maybe a couple minutes less of the talking, and i don't know that we'd have missed anything. then again, i need to see it again knowing the ending.i like this movie.(the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them. request granted.)

this film is engaging and complex while maintaining simple beauty .our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they 're life styles and pasts which support this.the two lead actors (bohl, brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors i have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. the actors' seamless acting teamed with bechard's beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.this film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of the story. the soundtrack serenades the viewer, soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film. i find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece. intriguing.intense.

this was a fantastic movie about two people, one a young teenage girl, and the other, a middle aged man, who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. the script, although written by gorman bechard, seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view. and at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless. i would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. it is clear in this film that you are not alone.

i am a film directors nightmare... especially of the mega buck, multiplex variety. while not a student of the art i still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film maker's vision, if i can find it. that's why a gem such as 'you are alone' is such an exhilarating find. the intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go. jessica bohl and richard brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director gorman bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people.spoiler belowi bought the dvd version and have shared it with several people. the reactions have been varied, from disbelief in the ability of daphne to complete the assignment for which buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating. as a compulsively skeptical moviegoer i have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker. this film took the later route for me and by the end i was so involved that i felt daphne's horror and pain at her role in buddy's demise. my reaction to this film reminded me of watching 'the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover' by peter greenaway many, many years ago. by the end i was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too. i've watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated. i am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies, 'galactic gigolo' and 'attack of the killer bimbos' and a mixed bag 'the kiss' which i recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesn't really represent the directors vision. too bad, because i loved the prior two films and even found 'the kiss' interesting but wish 'the kiss' was available in a director's cut with all of the original vision and music in tact. i look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads jessica bohl and richard brundage.

patricia arquette plays american doctor laura bowman, who takes a holiday to burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son. she is left behind in rangoon during a military crackdown and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a "tour guide." but he is no simple tour guide; he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps ... the two of them get caught up in the political upheaval and laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people.this movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. first, it's informational (describing some of the injustices that are occurring in burma). secondly, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. thirdly, it's about compassion and sacrifice, and people coming together - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear.just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important; nothing is wasted here. it's an earnest and moving film. there is also a very emotional score composed by hans zimmer which complements scenes nicely.a definite recommend, especially to people concerned with human rights ... and people who want to know, "what purpose can i serve?"

this is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s. if you allow yourself to identify with the patricia arquette character, you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life, and finding a new will to live.arquette's performance is brave because it is purposefully "wooden" -- it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death, her complete lack of a desire to be alive. she moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living. what is moving is how in the course of the story, she is reawakened -- by the burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes, and by the primal choices she is forced to confront.boorman supports this visually (and hans zimmer supports it with one of his most gorgeous, haunting scores) with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. we are on the outside looking in, just like arquette.... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life.i recommend the 1954 movie the purple plain as well. it's a similar story in a similar setting, and makes for a fascinating comparison.

you are alone is a beautiful, almost delicate film, smart directed, crisply written, with two complex and riveting performances, and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming, but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you misread.the story, about a highschool girl who drowns her depression and awkwardness by working a few hours a week as a $500 an hour "schoolgirl" escort, and the depressed next-door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown new haven hotel, features breathtaking performances from both jessica bohl, as the girl, and richard brundage, as her neighbor.bohl as daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with maggie gyllenhaal in secretary. she so captures a teenager's angst of growing into her own skin, and when she talks about always being in control, you start to realize she's not in control at all, but in danger of going over the deep end, which i guess in a way she does.brundage as buddy is depressed, angry, heartbroken, a shell of a man. but it isn't until the film's startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of his pain.after a very brief opening segment, which will hook most independent film lovers, and have the religious right running towards the exits, we are brought into the hotel room. at first you're not sure about these people, or the film-making style. shaky, annoying...like the characters. until you realize their back story, told in short flashbacks. they're confrontational at first for a reason, and so is the camera. but as they open up, as the story settles down, likewise, so does the camera. and, i don't know, 20 minutes in, give or take, you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screen.having just seen the world premiere screening at the brooklyn film fest -- where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes ¬ñ i almost wish the film were already on video so i could watch it again. because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film, particularly a very candid dialog regarding fantasy and climax, i really thought things were going in a very different direction. but i realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what i imagined. i need to see it again!!! but as dark and sexual as much of the talk is, blunt to say the least, i found myself laughing more than i might have expected at some of its candor, which definitely falls into the "things we think, but lack the nerve to say out loud" category. it's very blunt, especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning. some of it will make you uncomfortable, especially if you're watching you are alone with a partner. you'll definitely have something to talk about ¬ñ perhaps argue about ¬ñ afterwards. perhaps it should come with a warning: you should be alone when watching! the music is amazing. i would have come home, and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if i could have. the film looks as good as anything shot on film. after the screening director gorman bechard was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good. his answer: none. they couldn't afford it.i have to give bechard credit. i am a big fan of his two shorts, the pretty girl and objects in the mirror, but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this film.to everyone involved: bravo.

some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. you are alone is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain. death is explored figuratively and literally. it is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. it is the life not which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's. this film explores the aching pain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the ache below. the ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. bechard, the writer, is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand. he, as director, focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. this is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together i have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the "normal" encounter.the soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough. it is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, pain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. the perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it.i always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with mr. bechard's both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.

i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. "you are alone" is that movie (for me). the film is constantly in my head and in my heart. i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if i am seeing it for the first time.there is nothing i did not like about the movie. amazing soundtrack!!! the ending was perfect. very emotionally stirring!!! it was compelling and riveting.i adored jessica bohl and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed. i admired brittany's strength (what a strong woman).the tag line is "when your darkest moments come to life". we never know what we are capable of doing. everyone says oh i would never do that, when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation. we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject. the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part.thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!!

the 1980's 'my dinner with andre,' with wallace shawn and andre gregory, is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's 'you are alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul. the story revolves around three principal characters. there's daphne, a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, britney, as self-confident as daphne is self-conscious. what makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same personae. part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room. she halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door ¬ñ but it is britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is opened.on the other side of that door is buddy, a middle-aged nobody with few, if any, personal qualities that anyone would find attractive. he goes so far as to be confrontational about britney's chosen profession as soon as she enters the room. however, we soon learn that buddy is daphne's next-door neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood. this complicates things for the audience. is buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something else?if it's sex that buddy wants, here it is. britney loves sex. her definitions may be clintonesque but that doesn't lesson her enthusiasm. she prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from. each color band denotes a specific act that she'll perform ¬ñ but exactly which act isn't revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made. britney is, or believes that she is, in control of every encounter. even when blindfolded and bound, as she is by one of her regular clients, she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie. the film's imagery just keeps coming.buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance. he's lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies of the pretty teenager next-door. it's no coincidence that he's lured daphne or britney to this particular hotel room. there's a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left. this is a perfect metaphor for buddy's life; all of the good parts are finished. so it's here, where he brought his wife when they were still college students, that he makes his stand ¬ñ to regain some control of his own life, to make his statement.the director of 'you are alone,' gorman bechard, knows his craft. the principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, assisted by a myriad of inter-cut scenes that add dimension to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts.as the film progresses, britney asks buddy if she should get undressed. he says yes, but she strips only to her underwear. an actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes (one of the profession's five gets). but it isn't buddy that's being teased, we are. as the film concludes, we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play. a tease doesn't work unless it actually delivers. britney does, so does 'you are alone'.

it is now clear that the true golden age of american film was from the mid-60s until just before the release of star wars. before then, there was too much hays code-constricted pap. with star wars, the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons, a practice which continues to this day. the seven-ups, truth be told, contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue -- "we can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way" is one -- but i'm damned if i can find anything else wrong with it. (in fact, that line may not even have been stale when this film was made.) the seven-ups demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, real locations (winter in a dirty new york has never looked better/worse), propulsive stories, and, yes, the best car chase ever filmed. bill hickman is the driver scheider is chasing (you will recognize him from bullitt), and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the mcqueen one, but i prefer scheider's facial intensity here, the pacing, the terrific close-ups of the schoolchildren, and the shattering conclusion. (that vw bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the bullitt chase.) a stringy, screechy score by don ellis sets the perfect mood. the seven ups: bleak, grim, action-oriented, grown-up. this is a film that couldn't be made today; there's no "gimmick" for the kiddies or preposterous ending. thank you, philip d'antoni, roy scheider and tony lo bianco: for as long as cop films are watched, the seven-ups and its 1970s brethren (e.g., the french connection), will set the standard.

'steamboat willie' is the first cartoon with sound. mickey mouse is working on a steamboat. on board he is making music with all kind of tools. most of those tools are farm animals. this first one with sound is one of the better and funnier ones. it has some very clever moments. a short classic.

just can't watch this bit too many times, it's full of true enthusiasm and cleverness mickey mouse had in his first 30 years. nowadays' mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this. steamboat willie always makes me smile, at least the ending where mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. animation is very nice and although steamboat willie has no dialog, the music is enough for it.imho if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10 then any cartoon doesn't not only because it's a true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch.

the actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. the quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there the screenplay is intense and does not wander. the plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. we showed this film to a small group of patrons at gadsden's center for cultural arts. after the film, ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still "bothered". while we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film, i would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation.

the first ever fully synchronized sound cartoon, walt disney's mickey mouse makes his screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short subject "steamboat willie". mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of captain peg leg pete(or pete as he would later be called). mickey boards his long time companion minnie mouse aboard the train as they frolic about, while mickey attempts to impress minnie. this short was wildly fun and positively entertaining. animators ubbe iwerks, rudolph ising, and hugh harman assisted walt on the creation of the short."steamboat willie" essentially marks the beginning of the success of the walt disney company.

i caught this at the chicago indiefest and have to say you are alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think. not ha ha wedding crashers' funny, but sick, twisted, i can't believe she just said that but it's so damn true funny.jessica bohl, who deservedly won best actress, is amazing to watch. there's never a moment when you think oh, i'm watching a movie and she's an actress. she's too damn real for words.in fact there's 2 scenes that i'm still giggling over, and i won't give them away, but in one she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how "awesome" it is. (i almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!!!) in another she talks about a teenagers definition of "sex" versus an adults, and if it isn't the truest dialog i've heard in a movie in a long time, i don't know what is.

jessica bohl plays daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. daphne's neighbor is buddy (richard brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. once buddy strips daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. the entire film takes place at the hotel duncan, yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks. their appointment climaxes with the story's concluding twist.both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance. their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.the film's dialogue is natural, real to life. the writer, gorman bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate. daphne is intelligent, yet clearly still an eighteen year old. buddy may be middle-aged, but still not the hackneyed na√Øve type normally depicted in film. daphne and buddy's conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life, but is still comical at the right times. although the general mood is very relaxed, the dialogue has its own vivacity, forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the character's conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgarities.the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film. each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters. even existing independently from the film, the compilation truly expresses you are alone's central theme-- loneliness.you are alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken. definitely worth seeing¬Ö it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.

if you're tired by the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases, you'll enjoy "you are alone". it is thought provoking, well shot and riveting.without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. the vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.through their discussion, you explore two shifting views of prostitution, depression, loneliness. yet the movie is not depressing. it talks about dark things without being depressing.as a viewer, your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around, but gently. you come out of it with a lot to think about. i like that in a movie.

if you want to see a brilliant performance of mikado, played to perfection with expert timing and panache, don't watch this version. if you want to see a hammy version with eric idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society, this is the one to watch. it's a lot of fun and a good intro to gilbert and sullivan, but after this, rush out and rent the canadian stratford version. you'll see the difference between good and great. nobody does g&s better than brian mcdonald and the stratford group.

there are times i am convinced that the mikado is the best sullivan & gilbert opera ever, but that is only so long as i'm not listening to iolanthe. be that as it may, the mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the savoy operas. (yes, i put the composer first. nobody says hammerstein and rodgers, or hart and rodgers, or boito and verdi, or what's-his-face and strauss. you don't even hear the names of librettists for offenbach, suppe, or balfe. gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time, so they put his name first. it's time that silly practice was put to rest.anyway, the mikado is a compleat s&g operetta. it has some of sullivan's catchiest numbers, combined with some of gilbert's cleverest lyrics. it has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue. it's got a wonderful degree of craziness. and it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming.this particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, turns its imagination toward striking simplicity. set in a british seaside resort toward the end of the art nouveau period, it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely. the result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites, grey, and blacks, accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). it takes some getting used to, but it's really spiffy. of course, when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of japan, you would be right to exclaim, "oh, pooh. bah!" (did i just say that?) it's most gratifying that this fine production is now on dvd. however, one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy. the tendency to superimpose images is, alas, annoying. why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort? but it's the performance that counts the most. we may skip the overture, since although one is performed, sullivan never wrote one. (true, it may be so he wrote none for any of the savoys. but the mikado overture doesn't even date from sullivan's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) as for the rest of the operetta, it's first-rate and supremely funny.the ko-ko here is the estimable eric idle, who does it credit. there is a tradition of bringing a big name into the role. the was a u.s. tv production years ago in which ko-ko was played by groucho marx with mixed results. idle's performance is delightfully quirky ... he does "taken from a county jail" assisted by a tennis racquet. his "i've got a little list" is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics, which are much funnier than the usual run of such things, and his delivery is positively hysterical. it goes on that way throughout.in this operetta, it's important to have a good katisha; it's just no fun if you're not being bellowed at in style. this mikado has a fabulous katisha in felicity palmer, in her way almost as big a name as idle. she bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially, for a soprano. and her costume...!!! (not to mention her recital with franz liszt, apparently, accompanying.) nanki-poo is played by bonaventura bottone. i have trouble getting around is somewhat un-nanki-pooish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid, rich addition to the vocal palette. there is a nice touch during "a wand'ring minstrel", where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of "his nancy on his knee" -- bear in mind the mikado's decree about flirting. be that as it may, bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on nanki-poo, his performance does.yum-yum (lesley garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly. she and bottone do lovely duets. pish-tush (mark richardson) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well. poo bah (richard van allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water ... a role later done to death in american sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing). the mikado (richard angas) is bloody marvelous, with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyrics.i don't recommend you get this as your only mikado. get a good traditional production as well, so you can see what gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. that being said, i'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once. on the whole this is a terrific offering, a vocal and visual delight, with delicious over-acting. it's a dvd to treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap-dancing bellhops, and all. watch for the bellhops with signs.

i first saw this on thames television and loved it. i subsequently saw a dreadful write-up by someone who certainly hadn't watched or listened to it. so, i bought a copy and then i bought another copy! the only sad thing is that it is not available on pal vhs or region 2 dvd. the australian version is great, but this one is better! i might buy another.............

this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe. while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in 1993, seen now post 9/11, it is almost unbearable.it would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" come alive.our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the world trade center and subsequent readings of the 9/11 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated.some people have criticized the first and fourth amendments of the us constitution as being partly responsible for the islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans, but that is wrong headed in every possible way.surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on free speech, a free press or freedom of religion? i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant.the fact is, the fbi, the ins and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but they chose not to for a variety of reasons. besides, no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders. likewise, it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward mecca.consider this, until lee harvey oswald actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy, he wasn't really breaking any laws. living in a free society has its drawbacks.still, path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people. as far as i know, it is not on dvd and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it.i'm not really surprised, people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons, like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share information.this is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before, the final scene where ramzi yousef (played by art malik), the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and extradition simply says "next time we will bring them both down", is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes.

based on the true story of the fbis hunt for those who were responsible for the bombing of the world trade center building. a very good film that delves into the fbis use of informants and how, possibly, the tragedy could have been avoided 7 of 10

i watched the premiere of "path to paradise" way back and was stunned by it, dramatic license and all. i lived in nyc (brooklyn) a few years and kept in mind. today, given the links to groups such as al-queda, hamas, and the islamic jihad, i see it as a warning not recognized by our government. for that i place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of gov't and there is no excuse for our gov't to prevent it, period. "path to paradise" was but a dramatic view of the '93 preview, and no one cared. now, nearly 3,000 deaths later, and years behind, we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve.

i first saw this movie about 3 years ago. i was shocked at how stupid the fbi was not to prevent such a tragedy. it could have been easily prevented. this movie was just unbelievable.now seeing it after september 11th, i am appalled and can say that this could have been prevented more easily that most people would want to know.this film is 100% truein the final scene of the film, when the mastermind of the 1st attack is being taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers, he makes a spine chilling remark, that was laughed at when he said it. "next time we'll bring them *both* down." this was actually said by ramzi yousef after his arrest.this movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the noses of the fbi and nypd. it shows how the 1st and 4th amendments are partially to blame for the attacks.i watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented.

we'll never see this movie broadcast by hbo in the near future if at all. if anyone somehow comes across it in a video store just grab it before someone else does, because i doubt if it ever will be re-released again. an unbelievable and timely movie about the first attack on the world trade center on february 26, 1993 and how the government agencies who's job it is to identify and stop terrorists from doing harm and damage to american citizens and american property completely fell down on the job and unwittingly allowed it to happen.bone chilling since we all know now that the terrorists who were apprehended at the end of the movie weren't going to be the end of our nightmare that resurfaced on september 11, 2001. the film brought out everything that went wrong back in 1992-93 that allowed that first tragedy at the wtc to happen. still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first wtc attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the world trade center to happen. i found this movie harder to watch after the events of 9/11 then the video of the attacks of 9/11 themselves. all i can say about this film is don't watch it alone. the very ending itself is so powerful as well as prophetic that it would leave you in a state of shock in knowing what we know today and possibly in need to have someone who's with you, but not watching the movie, to call for medical attention.

i really enjoy this particular production of "the mikado." the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences -- for instance, "as some day it may happen" (the "little list" song) is completely updated, and a few lines are ad-libbed throughout the play. liberties were also taken with the setting. the costumes are not japanese, but rather 1920s english (although some of the "tittipudlian" girls wear '20s-inspired kimonos). this production is well-choreographed with some 1920s dance styles, and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes (as well as ears) entertained during the songs. if you're a gilbert & sullivan purist these changes may bother you, but i think they're fine -- and i love the costumes! felicity palmer (katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all of her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entrance -- the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics, so she screeches at the top of her voice, "stop it!!!"). all of the other main characters do a fine job as well. i particularly like mark richardson as pish-tush (that toupee!) and lesley garrett as yum-yum.you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly. there is no change of setting, although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest. if there is one draw-back to this production, it is that the stage makeup wasn't modified for close-up shots with a camera. foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick, and blush everywhere. i've seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays, and it's a little jarring at first. however, i hope you'll get used to it and enjoy "the mikado" for what it's worth -- a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic!

cowboys and indians is an excellent film. the writing, acting, directing could not have been better. this was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. a film that can do that is a rare a special thing. andrew berzins is an excellent writer, and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film. thank you for telling this story!!!ruby

others' main criticism of this film--namely that macy suddenly looks jewish upon donning his glasses--is misplaced. the glasses are just the little bit of change needed to convince others he's a jew. the scene in which he says to his boss, (paraphrasing) "but you know what my background is," along with another discussion with his mother, suggests that he's had to fight this same assumption in the past. the glasses now make him look just jewish enough to "confirm" his neighbors' and co-workers' existing suspicions. then there is his new wife's large nose and taste for loud clothes, which of course means she's jewish. the whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical nothings become the entire basis for judging others. if he has a lisp, he must be gay. if he has long hair, he smokes dope. if he's hispanic, he's got a knife...and if he has round black glasses and he's slight of build, he must be jewish. those statements all sound equally (im)plausible to me. if the conclusion people were jumping to in focus was reasonable, the whole point of the story would be lost.

i don't know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set, as it is in the middle of the war, macy has returned from the war (his neighbor asks "hey, is it true you got a fritz over there?") and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid anti-semitism, and macy and dern could wrapped up in it. funny how neither is jewish in this film but the accusation is made. also it is historically accurate, as the labor union democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of america and god. macy is continually pestered to come to the "meeting". his presence brings unexpected results.applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast. in 2005, has undergone a complete reversal, with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their unifier supporting the republican party and viewing organized labor as part of left-wing 'unpatriotic' america.a great picture to watch, if you care to see the friendly, timid and meek macy (played beautifully by him) get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40's in nyc.a tough, emotionally charged film.

the essential message - one which miller would have surely intended after seeing vichy war crimes trials - is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life. meat loaf's character, fred, has known lawrence for many years, and yet when the time comes, at the bidding of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their "target" group. for me, this is the crucial message - it doesn't matter what lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards - they are marked, and have chance to save themselves by using reason. animal aggression and anger have blinded fred's union thugs to reality.a friend of mine suggested i should see "the wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it. i once conducted an experiment in a role-playing game, and was shocked to see how normal and level-headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state - which would ultimate threaten them all - because it crept in in stages.fred is the start, his la friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong.the relationship between lawrence and finkelstein, the jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one, because lawrence misses the point almost until the end: if the bigots force finkelstein out, where is he to go? if his family have fled the nazis, what an irony to be tormented again in the land of "freedom".that big poster (it's a fairly famous propaganda piece) about american families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail. when you see this film, watch for the grafitti on the subway train, and all the little posters. the message lurks there too.this movie should be on the curriculum of every school, especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by "reasonable" people who are just extremists in thin disguises.

this movie packs a punch. there are a few every now and then that make me think deeply, and disturb me a lot. i could see myself in this same predicament - passively allowing things to happen around me, not standing up for the right and decent thing, just trying to avoid trouble. how often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out? how often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others. we would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do anything about it? lawrence newman (william h. macey) is a low-key, nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in brooklyn, ny in the waning days of world war ii. he rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him, has never married, rarely socializes, just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother. then a series of events in his very "white" little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events. it starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a puerto rican girl by the son of his neighbor. soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision. as he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. the one bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue on in his normalcy. then the virulent anti-semitism on that street catches him, despite his credentials as a presbyterian wasp. as things spiral further out of control, he discovers he must make an important decision - does he take a stand or does he simply go away.i cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for. post war anti-semitism is the setting here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. it is for the individual to decide where he or she stands.

i just watched it for the second time today and i must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it. and eric is hotter than ever. to often in the movies first nations people are seen as other than everyday people. we are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. hey we are just like everyone else. and this movie showed just that. we hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice. it is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that. i cant wait till this comes out on dvd. thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was.

most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by arthur miller that is the basis of it. it's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives.at the beginning, lawrence newman is an ordinary man. the eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. there couldn't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than william h. macy. not only is he a talented stage and screen actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. he is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities. his anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job. suddenly, he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the brooklyn of the 40s. is he jewish, is he not? the cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, directed with sure hand by neil slavin, kept reminding me of some edward hopper's paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple, menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. laura dern, david paymer, and especially meat loaf, who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door, are excellent, but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of william h. macy (h must stand for honest..) if you haven't read the book, i would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than arthur miller has.

first they came for the communists, and i didn't speak up, because i wasn't a communist. then they came for the jews, and i didn't speak up, because i wasn't a jew. then they came for the catholics, and i didn't speak up, because i was a protestant. then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.attributed to rev. martin niemoller, 1945when faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn. but when does enough become too much? global anti-semitic sentiments allowed hitler's genocidal policies to thrive, and equal doses of fear-mongering and ignorance made it possible for the anti-communist purges of mccarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples' lives. inaction makes one no less culpable.lawrence newman is a chameleon of a man: quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings. lawrence doesn't like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes about his business. his world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses, and is mistaken for one of "them." lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. while the subject matter of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice, when placed within a certain context - lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is jewish, than he is with the views of his attackers. he believes that if he corrects this "oversight" that everything will be all right, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. whether playing a schemer (the only thing i liked about "fargo") or a down home nice guy sheriff, william h. macy's roles are linked by a common thread -his characters share a subtle, deliberate countenance that gives them substance. macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail, and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue. by showing, rather than telling, lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer. the supporting cast brings the story together.laura dern is compelling as gerty, lawrence's bombshell wife with a past. trailer park rough, yet other worldly wise, she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of "a mistake" and unwittingly exacerbates lawrence's situation. michael lee aday (aka "meatloaf") is frightening as fred, the prototypical redneck next door, equal parts ignorance and venom, rallying neighbours to his virulent cause. in the midst of the chaos is finklestein (david paymer), the focus of the aggression, and the voice of reason that raises the important questions. paymer's even handed portrayal keeps finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy, making his one of the strongest performances in the film.the tight editing and close-cropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions, and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town usa feel - it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing. the deliberate use of harsh two-tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack, are powerful without being overwhelming. finally, the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era, an essential component in the film's message."focus'" unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film. just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.

cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. you shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your tv show. being made by the producers of xena is a quality guarantee, and cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from xena. the female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. along the two seasons of cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: cleopatra (jennifer sky), hel (gina torres) and sarge (victoria pratt). they all are different, but as a team, they work really well. the three main actresses appeared previously in xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from hercules too, or from both shows). i specially liked the character played by danielle cormack (ephiny in xena), which is very different from any of her roles i previously knew. so if you liked xena and hercules, you'll love cleopatra 2525. if you don't know them, try it: i'm sure you'll enjoy it.

there are moments when you don't want those deep drama-series. when you don't want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on. there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series, with lots of action and cool characters. for those moments, you have cleopatra 2525.i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlie's angels. critics said it was to superficial and silly. but the thing is, that's the point! people who can't relax and expected a serious movie hated it. it's exactly the same with cleopatra 2525. it is superficial. it has silly and unrealistic characters. and that's why i like it. it isn't like any other series.the first season wasn't very good. the character cleo was irritating and a little too much. the story was a little lame, and you didn't get to know the characters very much. but hey, they only had 20 minutes in every episode.in the last 5-6 episodes of cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series full 40-minutes length. and it was here i started to love it. the series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series. too bad they had to cancel the series. because the last episodes of cleopatra 2525 actually was very good. i will never forget hel, sarge and cleo. unique characters that only the creators of xena could have created!

i picked up a dvd at the 1¬Ä discount, having no idea what it's about (but at that price i can't resist..) in brief: i was positively surprised.so much that i did quite some research. on the german dvd (part 2 of a series of 3), episodes were recombined into two 85 minute parts, and out of order. here are my results, based on wikipedia's episode list:"doomsday" is in my boots + the voice (final episode). "war of the machines" is hel & high water (1, 2) + pod listener + juggernaut down.well, what can i say. underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men. i never watched charlie's angels so much, so i can't compare, but the more i watched, the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings. instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. i can imagine feminists have their fun with this, too. all in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure it was :^)

ya know the concept of "guilty pleasures"? yeah, you have 'em, like admitting you watched - and enjoyed - goonies, battlestar galactica after they reached earth, v the series, charlie's angels, starsky & hutch, the 1950s version of superman, or godzilla movies.here's the ultimate in guilty pleasures. coupled with jack of all trades in a sam raimi action packed hour, this half hour slot is fast paced, easy to follow, and loaded with fun-to-watch scanlity-clad babes.the man that brought us evil dead, xena, hercules, and the adventures of brisco county jr does it again with this 2000 update of charlies angels. we got charlie (voice) an unknown being that has the knowlege and the time to find people who need help, bosley (mouser) the gadget man, and three gorgeous babes that kick a** for a living.and oh what a living!

as i have said before in previous comments, some programmes are there to be 'light entertainment'. so i get somewhat frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you will not get that from cleopatra 2525 and it does not presume to offer it. what you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. she does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of james bond ready to take on all comers.cleopatra is overawed by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be. however it is light entertainment, the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting. the episode when there is a double of cleopatra is particularly moving and jennifer sky i think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time, and being a film and television buff i know what i am talking about. finally to prove my sincerity i have purchased all but four of the episodes and i am entirely satisfied with my purchase. the only reason i do not have the complete set is because i purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set. victoria pratt and gina torres complete the trio creditably and for light entertainment cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.

this second pairing of wile e. coyote and the road runner is a great as the first. predictable maybe, but i don't care and still laugh so much whenever i see it. the wile e./road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart. so knowing that the second disc of the golden collection would not only feature 11 of this, but they would be in chronological order (2 through 12, the first episode was on volume 1), made me get misty eyed. i love this stuff. this animated short can be seen on disc 2 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2. it also features an optional commentary by micheal barrier.my grade: a+

chuck jones's 'beep beep' (so called despite the fact that the road runner clearly says "meep meep") is the second of the exceptionally popular road runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but lacklustre 'fast and furry-ous'. while it features several predictable quickfire gags, 'beep beep' also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. chief among these is a fantastic, extended chase through an old mine in which we see the coyote and the road runner represented by two small lights. there's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket-powered roller-skates. 'beep beep' also sees a great improvement in the representation of wile e. coyote. not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in 'fast and furry-ous' but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain. although it's a little slow to get going (too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags), once 'beep beep' arrives at the mine shaft sequence it's clear that jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them. there are better road runner cartoons than 'beep beep' but there's a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario.

this cartoon documents the second encounter between wile e. coyote and the roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in fast and furry-ous (1949).if measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. regardless, this is a very funny short. coyote (carnivorous vulgaris) chases the roadrunner (accelerati incredibilus) along the road and gets completely tired out. the ingenious scientific "latin" names of the characters are very original, and has been mimicked before in other un-related cartoons. the coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of- i don't know -boredom. such jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes. then he has an idea, and another laughable expression is worn. the slapstick jokes are all hilarious, and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such pain on a poor, helpless, genius coyote. everyone knows, but who cares?the old rocket gag is present, too. coyote straps himself to a rocket, which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with roadrunner and grab him. instead, the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: eat at joe's. this classical gag originates from this cartoon; though obvious, it still makes people laugh.the highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft. the two wear helmet-lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two are going, with only the lights visible. here, the comedy reaches a peak. a must-see sequence, maybe even the best sequence in the early days of roadrunner. the final touch is provided by the writing of michael maltese, as coyote's light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters "yipe!" after the blast. such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes, and as soon as it starts the fun's all over. the rocket skates are another good idea, as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight-rope (a sequence that appears in space jam [1996]). to give the results of those away would be useless. the free drink proves to be a problem for wile e. at the end of the second-last sequence: namely the rocket skates.this classical cartoon is littered with fine animation, except for the characters. though they are animated very well, the two characters are very primitive; which might be an understatement. though at first it may seem weird, the humor of the ensuing sequences makes one forget.if you like vintage jones, watch this. if you love roadrunner, get this on video. excellent entertainment (rating: 8/10).

i grew up in winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday. there are good and bad in every race, why make them all out to be bad? that goes for all races today. john harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve. how do i know this? john harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation. he was a kind and gentle soul, he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right. i wasn't very old when he left our house, but i can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldn't be bothered. he even taught grade 3 the year before he came to winnipeg. none of this is mentioned in the movie, and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as i'm concerned. what happened to john is unforgivable, not only in the native community, but also in the white community. not everyone in winnipeg think like the police do, i knew the person inside, and what he was like as a person, not an indian!

ok, so in any wile e. coyote-road runner cartoons, we know that wec is going to set up all sorts of traps for rr, but always maim himself in various ways. that certainly happens in "beep, beep". predictable? i guess that it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show how the more you try to harm someone else, the more you get harmed; sort of like how daffy duck always tries to undermine bugs bunny's integrity but bugs sees around it.overall, this is another classic from the termite terrace crowd. sometimes, i think that if we really had wanted to ease cold war tensions, we could have just let the soviet union see looney tunes cartoons; i'm sure that they would have loved them. another great one.ps: i learned on "jeopardy!" that wile e. coyote's middle name is ethelbert.

i think i am some kind of road runner fan. i don't care how predictable it is, i laugh anyway. 'beep, beep' is predictable most of the time, although it is pretty ingenious at the same time as well. of course the road runner is chased by the coyote and of course the coyote fails to catch the road runner with every new attempt. the plans the coyote comes up with are very funny. you see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not disappointed. well, one time you are sort of disappointed, what you think will happen does not, but it makes the joke even funnier.if you like the road runner shorts you will love this one. the predictable gags work and the animation is great and pretty original at times.

this is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular.....but who's complaining? it's always fun to see the poor coyote try various contraptions to get the road runner, and then get pulverized by every one of those inventions.the underground cave chase was different from the normal fare and was clever. it gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze-like structure. i didn't say it was hilarious; just different from the normal above-ground antics.this one, along with some other road runner shorts, are featured on the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 and the transfers of them are spectacular. the colors are magnificent.

remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible? this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance.i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about. it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the "black forest." he goes there to help, but ends up being caught between two young women, both of whom he seems to have a thing for. but that's just scratching the surface. this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen...and not nice thing. people are constantly being whipped and stabbed. there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining. tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore. he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering.on some level, this is a movie about sex. it's one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but there's no mistaking the intent. on another whole level, it's a stoner's paradise. unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected. by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn, you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick.on the down side, the film is pretty wordy. some of the points are hammered home over and over. if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends, this might prove an asset.

the first movie at the fangoria festival in vegas and the most challenging. it's not a movie for everyone. a number of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. this picture seemed determined to do its own thing.tom savini showed some comic chops as the over the top villain. he dominated every scene he was in, flipping his cape about like leslie neilson playing dracula. it was great to hear his explanation after the film. he had such a good sense of humor about the role.i was glad i didn't have too many preconceptions going in, because the movie offered a lot of surprises. the story was funny and profane and unusual. there was a lot of love lavished on the look. most important, it had a weird edge to it. unlike many of the movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this was a movie that used its look for a purpose.there were a lot of movies at the fangoria festival with bigger budgets, but none that dared to be this different.

i watched sea of dust at the rhode island horror film festival in providence. it was the festival's featured film and won best picture out of i think a couple hundred entries. the director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing. one star, suzy lorraine, was even hotter in person than in the film, and she was an eye catcher in the movie.this film is independent, yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel. it even has an original classical style musical score.i am a savini fan and he's the star villain here, in black cape, he's more of an evil force than a real person i think. he is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the kingdom of god on earth. in his view, christ was all about suffering and savini intends to make everyone suffer.the main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor, stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events savini is causing in an isolated town. he proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her sob father tells him to get lost. then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl. i think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, as do a number of hot women in the film.i found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye catching, with strange people along the road (the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of me).the film has a lot to it, too much to list. there is a lot of blood, torture and gore. hot chicks licking blood off of guys' fingers. a terrified girl's head explodes. that was unexpected. throats get slit. some brutal stabbings.then they play it for laughs sometimes, poking a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genre.if you're a fan of hammer films and ingrid pitt, it is fascinating to see her in this movie. she offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull. excellent. the guy who played "multiple miggs" in silence of the lambs is great in an axe fight.the movie is surreal and with the ending, i'm not sure the events happened or if they were in stefan's head because of his rejection by his would-be fianc√©e. he returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal.the director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings. i can see that for sure, savini's view of religion was scary.this was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like savini and pitt, a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes, great gore scenes, action, and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next.this deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film effort, i don't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget, and yet they managed to make something really attractive, unique and thought provoking.

i also attended the ri international horror film festival and i can easily see why this film won best of show.sea of dust is a wild romp of horror, comedy and beautiful scenery. a back in time tale of strange goings on. an increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people's heads exploding, brings a young professor's apprentice; stefan, to investigate. along his travels, he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's hand in marriage, only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn father¬Ö along the way "out of town" he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to dr. maitland, (brilliantly played by up and coming vincent price like actor: edward x young.) who fills stefan in on the evils a foot. only the dr. is insulted that he had called for the professor and only received a boy in training¬Önone the less, stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander. horror icon; tom savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; prester john. scream queen; ingrid pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as anna. many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax.dark religion and over the top, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play heavily in this hammer tribute flick. this stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the character's reality.horror and gore aside; this is also a very funny movie! slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. very entertaining and original.

the real life case of an innocent first nations chief(the indian) by an winnipeg city officer(the cowboy) is the basis of this tv movie. the actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in canada, a small scale martin luther king thing. the misjustice of first nations people is becoming a staple in the canadian cinema diet. what makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions. the father played by gordon tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by eric schweig demands justice. the stars gordon tootoosis and adam beach(windtalkers, skinwalkers)have minor, almost cameo, appearances. soon-to-be star eric schweig makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance. an honourable mention goes to veteran actor gary chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit. his portrayal of the troubled soul inspector dowson was worthy of a gemini award(the canadian emmy)along with eric schweig. the special effects(jump cuts, dream sequences) are occasional and not overbearing. couple this with some beautiful northern canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and first nations people like the neil stonechild case, and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience.

blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action, i cant wait for blade 2, this is one of wesley snipes greatest movies, the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great.

okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (dolph lundgren as the punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard. i've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, i suppose. i judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.) so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating? because it tries. it tries very hard. in my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever. some of those ideas are included here. the storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way. blade (wesley snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have slowly but surely moved into the world, and share it with humankind. for the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. the vampires have even taken familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being "turned."now that i think of it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film, they live. a hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in blade as well.the acting isn't the best here. snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; n'bushe wright, a relative newcomer, isn't too bad; kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade's sidekick (he's to blade what chip is to the punisher). stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the "head" vampire you just love to hate.i don't know, but i just loved the special effects in this film. from the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film, the special effects aren't half bad. there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right? the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique, and not generally used in contemporary action films. snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with, say, a machine gun. plus, there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away. (unless, of course, you are indiana jones.)overall, this isn't the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad, either. as a bonus, the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool, too. tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like source direct or photek?!my rating: 8/10

it's also the best book i've ever read. karl urban and steve zahn are great together. it had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. i laughed. i cried. it's hard not to laugh when gus is talking. i wish gus would have smacked clara like he did inez. clara just lead gus on all those years with no intentions of ever marrying him. she just liked playing with him. it was sad that he spent his whole life pining for her. it would have been nice if woodrow had married maggie but she would have just died on him anyway. woodrow was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up. it was obvious that he loved maggie after the raid on austin when the rangers got back and he ran to hold her. val kilmer is excellent at playing odd characters. i loved his portrayal of captian inish skull. i loved the whole lonesome dove saga. comanche moon is the best of the bunch.

too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by mcmurtry about the texas rangers vs. the indian. this screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline. it ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to lonesome dove.the series main characters were in truth cast very well, the filming locations were excellent, but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book.

"comanche moon" had everything going for it. for starters, simon wincer's back, a man who's name is synonymous with high-quality tv westerns. unfortunately, the problems with "moon" are something even the most talented director couldn't solve: a poor script based on a lackluster novel.forget historical accuracies -- as any reader of the novels can tell you, the biggest travesty in "moon" is that it's not even consistent with information from the original "lonesome dove" masterpiece. so many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater degree, the book, are completely missing in "moon." considering the fact that most viewers of "moon" are probably coming with at least some sort of "dove" background, the lack of character-driven and emotional backstory is downright painful. that said, "moon" is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen. for example, the novel "moon" focuses largely on the comanches themselves. to its credit, the miniseries tries to service the comanches, but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story. similarly, val kilmer's scull loses out here too -- the role should have either been expanded so kilmer (and rachel griffiths, for that matter) actually had something to do, or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller, supporting parts. instead, kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book (a killer parrot? what?) -- further, there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be. not a single one of their expeditions in moon (or "dead man's walk," for that matter) ends successfully, and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another.frankly, larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script, and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie, brokeback mountain. mcmurtry can write good novels (although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement), but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter. this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer, but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen. witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit, but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original "lonesome dove." with all this said, "comanche moon" is almost a brilliant production, aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do. steve zahn's portrayal of gus mccrae -- or rather, his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae -- is dead-on. and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call, saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet, stoic woodrow of the original movie, all i can say is: blame mcmurtry, because mcmurtry is the one who -- both in the "moon" novel and now the miniseries -- turned woodrow from socially inept, awkward, but natural leader, into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the "sequel".still, it's the cast that sparkles in "moon," to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original "lonesome dove" -- this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long, long time to come -- and quite honestly, this cast could have done so well in a well-nurtured, full-blown network tv series.all in all, aside from wasted opportunities with the cast, the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating, utterly fascinating, to see translated on screen. unfortunately, all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtry's tedious, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant, prequel.

i am very impressed with the acting in comanche moon. before i started watching this, i wasn't expecting it to be as good as lonesome dove. i couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. it blew my mind how well they played each role! this was in my opinion almost as good as lonesome dove. its hard to compare any film to lonesome dove. if you don't make that comparison, i would give this a thumbs up. it was very entertaining! i don't post many comments on this site, but i just felt i had to get my opinion out there. amazing! i don't want to go off naming every actor who was brilliant, because i would probably have to list every single one. my favorite was steve zahn. he hit the nail on the head playing captain gus. his mannerisms were perfect.

things i like. steve zahn as gus, nails the part, copies robert duvalls mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to gus fans. (some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well). karl urban, looks grim and tough, but can crack a joke and smile too, which t.l.jones did in original series. the gear, the guns, the clothing, all accurate, or very close to period accurate. i'll never forgive costner and duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in open range. the comanches, they are actually riding bareback, rather than hiding a modern saddle under a navajo blanket. and they aren't painted as politically correct peace loving pastoralists, but as a proud warrior people. there are some dumb scenes, but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows.

everyone wants duvall and jones back, come on! viewers are saying things like, zahn and urban aren't as deep...puhlease! were you as deep when you were young? that's the whole point: they have a lot to learn. zahn and urban pull off the shallow innocence they were directed to act, and with superb commitment to preserving the nuances of duvall and jones' input into the characters. zahn is flagrantly perfect as the early gus, and urban is subtly perfect as the early woodrow. what a bold move it must have been for them to take on such a position in the entertainment industry. they must have known they would have everyone coming down on them for not actually being the beloved originals, yet they clearly put the best effort forward. i gave it a 7 because the editing was choppy in places, and time-lines were sketchy, but the acting was a joy to watch. val kilmer was absolutely great. one more thing: i expect audiences would have been more accepting of the mysticism implied by the appearances of a jaguar and blue and gold macaw if more effort had been put into the way they appear and are so simply accepted by the characters.

i am a big fan of lonesome dove and all the books in the series and i love the movie. i was happy to see that they finished up with comanche moon. i have been a long time fan of steve zahn and was eager to see him in a serious role. i personally think that steve zahn has done an amazing job of re-creating gus. i can't think of another actor who would have been better. he has the voice, the mannerisms, the pronunciation of word all down to a t. granted, no one could ever hold a candle to robert duvall as gus, but i think that steve zahn has done a pretty darn good job. karl urban acts the same in all the movies he has been in so he has made a good match for woodrow call. as for the movie itself, yeah it's a little corny but can you really beat lonesome dove? no, i don't think so.

i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner. i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect. unfortunately, even though these two actors were/are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here. some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support.though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath, there was very little (none) to that effect in the movie.overall, i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective.the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating. not sure i'll ever go deep sea fishing again...i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented.definitely a movie that could've been seen on dvd.

this movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie. stu unger lived an extraordinary life. imagine if stu were alive today! this movie paints a picture of what stu unger's life might have felt like. it was interesting to see how connected was growing up. i would have liked to seen more detail on stu's partying, his gamesmanship and his relationship to bob stupak. but all in all, this movie was well done, well acted and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were larger than life.this movie is worth renting.

stuey unger was a card playing legend. he was quoted in an interview as saying, "some day, i suppose it's possible for someone to be a better no limit hold'em player than me. i doubt it, but it could happen. but, i swear to you, i don't see how anyone could ever play gin better than me." there's a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in 'x-men' as a showcase for a superhero's mutant power. that's how incredible this man was.i have a few minor problems with this movie. as dark as this movie was, stuey's real life was darker. poker pro todd brunson said, "during the last world series of poker, bob stupak, mike sexton and i had a drink and talked about stu. mike told us how he could barely talk, hadn't showered in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack pipe." in the film, michael imperioli looked far too healthy to be stu unger in the final years of his life. when stuey won his last wsop he looked like a skeleton, but let's face it, this production lacked both the time and the "deniro" to make that kind of transformation. my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing, with actual hands and situations. sure it might have bored the average non poker enthusiast, but it would have been nice for the hardcores. too bad the movie wasn't 6 hours or so longer.i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it. just like you don't have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy gibson's "the patriot", you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem. can't wait for the dvd. (8 out of 10)

what is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactions?some people here have called high roller "disgusting." some have called it "extraordinary" (as would i, actually).why? i think it's because films like this don't make heroes out of jerks, or glamour out of degeneration, and some people just can't deal with that emotionally. they need a hero. and i'd also add that if they're gamblers or poker players, they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn't justified.high roller in not a poker movie. it's a people movie. it's not perfect, but it looks good, is well-written, and wonderfully acted. and best of all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection.and maybe that's what makes some people so damn mad.

it's a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments. films like these are the stretching grounds of great actors, they enjoy tossing the ball in open pieces like these. the angel that wasn't what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change. it is echoed in kevin smith's piece, dogma, almost in the same slapstick vein.-=0) watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in. could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this? possibly one of the most fun pieces i have seen in a while, i ran into this one on vhs in a trash can because someone's basement was flooded this summer, and i grabbed a handful of tapes.whether in a trash bin, or on the silver screen, mild comedies like this are fun, you just don't have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it, or a swank political party. just keep it for yourself, and i'll bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time.

why would this film be so good, but only gross an estimated $95,000,000 and have no award nominations? john travolta knows what he's doing. he knows he's michael, a cigar smoking, womanizing, magical arch angel that came down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of "the national mirror" and their dog, sparky, on the way to chicago. it then turns into a road trip that's both horrible and great. i don't even think the death scenes (3 to be exact) make this a tearjerker. the soundtrack is the best with "heaven is my home", "up around the bend", and "chains of fools". i have very great expectations about this and i say that it should have had a little more respect in the 90's. read my comment. bye!

"goodbye, mr. chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. aside from peter o'toole's wonderfully controlled, understated performance as the pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and is changed by it, the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals, from grecian ruins to london side streets to an extended countryside montage. the music and lyrics by leslie bricusse have been criticized as being dull or not-up-to par for film musicals, but they are used to enhance the story rather than tell it. many songs are used to underscore montages or scenes; the few that don't are relegated to "show biz" numbers. in this manner, the songs do not intrude upon this delicate story but heighten what the characters are thinking or feeling. "where did my childhood go?", "walk through the world with me", and "you and i" are especially effective. an absorbing, brilliantly acted, directed and written film.

i love this movie because every single element of it is nothing less than excellent. i will quickly praise a few of them. peter o'toole gives us one of his great performances as he becomes the definitive mr. chips. petula clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as katharine. the director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way. combine that with the fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you have a film that shows the fine quality of its production. i can't praise the well-planned camera work enough, it moves us up and around, zooming in and out, giving us the best views of, and letting the locations become part of the scene. petula clark's last song 'you and i' is just 3 beautifully composed long takes, and in this era of 2 second takes, i can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to get those long scenes perfect. the music is great, and the songs move the story along just as they should. leslie bricusse is one of my favorite composers. listen to these songs, how could anyone not like them? this is a very romantic story between two people nearing middle age that find each other, bring out the best in each other, and it lasts till the end of their lives. excellent production values, acting, camera work, and music, make this movie well worth watching.

peter o'toole is arthur chipping a latin teacher with strict adherence to detail and thoroughness in helping young minds grasp the meaning and definition of latin words and phrases. he is seen as being cold and unfair and not in touch with the times. but upon meeting stage actress singer katherine briskit (petula clark) not only at a late supper after a performance of london is london but at an amphitheater in greece his closed minded world starts to open up.goodbye mr. chips is an mgm musical remake of the 1939 movie also from mgm. during this time musicals were out and the hollywood studio system was in total shambles. when it premiered in new york los angeles and london the musical numbers were left intact but when it came to the local main street theaters world wide it was sans songs therefore making the movie shorter and gaped to the max.thanks to mgm/ua home video under ted turner in the late 1980's early 1990's when vhs and laser disc were the main home video formats of choice the musical numbers were re-instituted and the gaps closed. laserdisc though was the only format chosen to view goodbye mr. chips in the widescreen letterbox format.for awhile now the original motion picture soundtrack was only available on the original out of print vinyl and cassette tape and can still be found today on ebay.thanks to the wonderful people at film score monthly.com in 2006 the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and remixed into a 3 cd set featuring the completely reconstructed score, the original 1969 general release album score, and narrated sequences source music and interviews a plenty. you also get 1 unused song which is a real lost gem, "tomorrow with me" by petula clark which would have been chosen in place of "you and i" before hand.this movie is both a classic musical and a real tribute to educators everywhere. i most certainly would buy this movie if warner bros. mgm and sony would put their money where there mouth is and get this film restored from all master film sources and put it on both dvd and blu ray with all the bells and whistles put back into place with all the extras you can find and stuff into a release.

i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it. i'm sad that sony has not seen fit to release this on dvd ("but one day, one day..."). i recently obtained a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. i'm happy to report it still stands the test of time. the acting is spot-on, john williams' orchestrations are lush and leslie bricusse's songs memorable ("when i am older," "you and i," "fill the world with love," "london is london" are just a few of the standouts. and not enough can be said about peter o' toole, petula clarke, michael redgrave and michael bryant's acting. terence rattigan deserves an a+ for his update of the james hilton story. there really is nothing not to like about this film. it's a good cheer-me-up selection. glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three-cd set with lots of extras. wish sony would hurry up and do the same with the film.

i wish i was first exposed to this in a movie theater when it was first released, as some of the commentors had been. it really is a treasure. to be fair i have not seen any other version of goodbye, mr. chips and neither do i want to. to me this stands as a perfect version. i first saw it on tcm years ago and never forgot it. i had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday, although i had recorded it from tcm days earlier. there were portions of the movie in which both of us were teary-eyed, it really is a moving movie.and shouldn't that be what movies are all about?the music is beautiful, the film was shot wonderfully. the acting is top notch. and the story is delicate and timeless.one of my favorite movies of all-time.

i saw this film when it first came out, and didn't know what to expect exactly. what followed the overture was one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences i have ever had. a lush score of songs and music by britisher leslie bricusse (of doctor doolittle & wilie wonka and the chocolate factory fame as well as making his mark on the broadway musical scene), and scored by the incomparable john williams. there's not a bad song in the entire film. plus some of the most exquisite cinematography, costume design and filming locations i have ever seen in one film. not to mention the academy award nominated performance by peter o'toole, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, by the wonderful petula clark. now, given that peter is not the same caliber a singer that petula is, he still manages to sell his songs to the audience, and that, after all, is what it is all about. this is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by james hilton, and deserves to be treasured for generations to come. i recommend this film for family viewing, though most men will consider this a 'chick' flick. but if you like a truly great film musical, then this film is for you. but be warned that a standby box of kleenex is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure.

peter o'toole, one of our finest actors, is magnificent as a reserved school master who is dedicated to teaching young boys. he meets a show girl and falls in love. the story is one of love and devotion. petula clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not too mention a remarkable voice. you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one. i enjoyed it.

yes 1939/robert donat-greer garson version was the best...perfection..donat won the oscar in a very tough year..gable in gwtw & james stewart as mr. smith. were 2 of his competitors. .wow was that a rough year.. most critics in ny hated this version. so.didnt see in theatre! finally saw this a.m. on tcm & enjoyed..peter o'toole was excellent & glad he was oscar nominated for this,,& esp pleased oscar finally gave him a special award this past year... petula clark was good as mrs. chips but her character,i feel was poorly written...some good songs esp. you & i... sung by ms.clark & later recorded by many others including t.bennett/s. bassey & carmen macrae.... the b&w version was more authentic.. but this is a good film beautifully photographed in color & panavision... enjoyable worth seeing & bravo, again, mr. o'toole!

caught this 1969 film on cable tcm one night. i remember when i first saw the film in hong kong, i really enjoyed the songs and performances by peter o'toole and petula clark. i love clark best in francis ford coppola's "finian's rainbow" (1968) opposite fred astaire, don francks and tommy steele. simply ecstatic to learn that finally, this delightful irish-flavored pot of gold musical is released on dvd! ah, "it's that old devil moon (in your eyes)." peter o'toole as mr. chips - yes, he did sing - quite a deliverance. he may not be a veteran at musical like rex harrison, but he inhabited the role marvelously. the scene of him running across the lawn in his cape a-flying reminds me of the pbs series, "to serve them all my days" - a lovable schoolmaster and loving man, he is, 'mr. chipey.' clark and o'toole somehow gave us just the right mix of spunk and circumstance. the songs and lyrics by leslie bricusse are catchy as usual. the tunes of "you and i" and "walk through the world (with me)" stayed with me the most all these years. and there's "what a lot of flowers," "and the sky smiled," "fill the world with love" - not syrupy at all. sometimes i think if the world is immersed in bricusse's songs and words, we would overcome all strife on earth and 'lovely' will be all our days! yes, "talk to the animals," too. ("doctor doolittle" 1967) musicals are a blessing to the world of moviegoers, they are somehow larger than life. like the music and lyrics by the sherman brothers (richard m. and robert b.) who gave us "chitty chitty bang bang" (1968) and "mary poppins" (1964) - who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply uttering "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? i was tickled by even just one featured song & dance number in the spanish film "km.0 - kilometer zero" (2000). my all time favorite is french filmmaker jacques demy's "young girls of rochefort" (1967) with colorful cast of catherine deneuve and (late sister) francoise dorl√©ac, jacques perrin, michel piccoli, danielle darrieux, gene kelly and george chakiris singing, dancing to michel legrand's music. long live musicals.

i enjoyed the movie and the story immensely! i have seen the original(1939 i believe) and enjoyed them both. to really appreciate the story one must be familiar with english culture and customs. the prof.(peter o'toole) was dedicated to his school and "the boys" in that school. it was an english "public" school, which we in the u.s. refer to as a private school (e.g. andover). he is a very ascetic person and, on the surface, gives the appearance of being stiff, stuffy, uncaring, and weak to the point of being effeminate. he is strict in his educational standards because he does care for "his lads", i.e., he doesn't want them to get a cheap or weak education. he meets(through introduction) a "dance hall girl"(petula clark) and is totally smitten. in england at the time, the reference to "dance hall" carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely "lower class". we find that the prof. is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and institutions that he loves and/or respects. clark becomes more than a lover and wife...she "leavens" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person, much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness. the first movie was set before ww ii, this one goes through ww ii, also, it is 1969( we've had the "british invasion"...beetles, etc. clark had hits and was very popular then...still is to me), the music is great, color and photography excellent. i think o'toole played the character perfectly! there are dedicated people like "chips"...all around us but many do not receive the recognition. very enjoyable movie and story!

when it opened in london during the christmas season of 1969 this musical version of james hilton's famous story was drubbed by the critics. the same reception greeted it when it opened in the us, prompting mgm to withdraw its "roadshow" status and cut almost all of its songs. what a mistake!!!watched years later, when the trendy world of the 60's and 70's has turned in upon itself, this version of goodbye, mr.chips is a total delight. first of all, as "chipping", peter o'toole gives one of his greatest performances. to watch him turn from the hated, cold, emotionless latin teacher at a boy's boarding school, to a man who finally can see the colors in the world (after falling for and marrying musical star catherine briskit) is to see a genius at work. (if you can, watch lawrence of arabia, the lion in winter, my favorite year and chips back to back over a number of days or weeks. then you will see what a truly great actor o'toole is, and how magnificent he is in chips.) catherine, as played by the glowing petula clark, at the height of her popularity, is ever man's dream; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a great voice to boot. most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly, while the direction by the late herbert ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life.okay, this film may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted, sung, and directed love story, look no further. (if you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version, better yet. i am anxiously awaiting chips' debut on dvd.)

thirty years after the 1939 classic film won robert donat an oscar and made greer garson a star, "goodbye, mr. chips" overcame a multitude of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version. original stars rex harrison and samantha eggar were replaced by richard burton and lee remick, who in turn were given the heave-ho in favor of - thankfully - peter o'toole and petula clark. andre previn's score was rejected, and the one eventually used was composed by - unfortunately - leslie bricusse. first-time director herbert ross was handed the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - that of a man for both his wife and students - into a big-budget extravaganza. that it succeeds as well as it does despite the many obstacles in its way is a testament to its two stars.arthur chipping is a latin teacher at brookfield, a boys' school in suburban england where he himself was educated. introverted and socially inept, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. prior to summer holiday, a former student takes him to a london music hall to see an entertainment starring katharine bridges, the young lady he hopes to wed. the post-performance meeting is awkward for all, and chips - as he is commonly known - sets off to explore some of italy's ancient ruins. unexpectedly, he runs into katharine, who has booked a mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn a failed love affair and ponder the direction of her career. in the time they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the befuddled exterior, and upon returning to london pursues him in earnest. when the fall term begins, chips returns to brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity. complications arise when aspects of katharine's past surface, and again when world war ii intrudes in their lives, but chips is bolstered by his wife's support, and his new-found confidence makes him a favorite among the students.aside from a couple of musical interludes - the delightful music hall production number "london is london" and katharine's declaration of love, "you and i" - most of bricusse's songs, some of them performed in voice-over as the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgettable and in no way enhance the film. eliminate the score entirely, and "goodbye, mr. chips" works quite well as a drama. terrence rattigan's script retains elements of the original while expanding upon it and updating it by a couple of decades. he has crafted several scenes between chips and katharine that beautifully delineate their devotion to each other, and infused a few with comic relief courtesy of katharine's friend and cohort, over-the-top actress ursula mossbank (delightfully played by sian phillips, o'toole's real-life wife at the time). he also captures life at a british public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the states - with unerring perfection.ross does well as a first-time director, liberally sprinkling the film with breathtakingly photographed moments - the opening credits sequence, during which the school anthem echoes in the vast stone hallways of the school, perfectly sets the tone for the film. costumes and sets are true to the period. the students, portrayed by non-professionals who were enrolled at the school used as brookfield, handle their various small supporting roles well.highest praise is reserved for peter o'toole and petula clark in the lead roles. o'toole was long-established as a first-class dramatic actor, so his academy award-nominated performance here comes as no surprise. clark, a veteran of some two dozen b-movies in the uk and the previous year's "finian's rainbow," is absolutely luminous as the music hall soubrette who forsakes a theatrical career in favor of life as a schoolmaster's wife. her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are, and she more than matches o'toole in their dramatic scenes together. the chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us with no doubt that this is a couple very much in love.this version of "goodbye, mr. chips" is no classic like its predecessor, but hardly the disaster many critics described when it was released. ignore the score, concentrate on the performances, and revel in the atmosphere ross has put on the screen. it's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.

if you only see one ernest movie in your life, make it this one! this is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. the other "ernest" flicks were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not me, however.).in this movie, ernest p. whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case. the murderer, nash, just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest. mr. nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him, and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer.a great flick! if you haven't already seen it, watch it!

this is a good film. this is very funny. yet after this film there were no good ernest films!

this was easily one of the weirder of the ernest movies, especially in regards to the production design. what was up with the pink guard uniforms? sadly, this film probably destroyed the ernest series, turning the series into a straight-to-video series. however, jim varney gave one of his better performances by playing nash, his criminal alter ego. a misstep in the series, but wasn't too bad in most regards.(the electro man routine was classic)

this is an excellent movie. there were several parts to the movie i liked. this movie is very funny! visit the ernest fun club web site at www.ernestfunclub.com there are several movies such as the following: ernest goes to camp, ernest saves christmas, ernest goes to jail, ernest in the army, ernest goes to school, ernest rides again slam dunk ernest etc. i highly recommend these for family movies. all star jim varney again try visiting www.ernestfunclub.com which is the best ernest movie? in my opinion there are actually 2 ernest goes to camp and ernest goes to jail. so if you have never seen ernest p. worrell its time to go and see him. you will find him quite satisfactory "no what i mean"?

ernest p. worrell comes through with his third movie presentation. jim varney not only plays ernest, but doubles as the evil mr. nash. from start to finish this movie has some solid laughs and makes a good family film! rated pg for comic book violence.

this is a really good flick with awesome humor. jim verney as we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this movie.this is definitely the best of the ernest films.i would surely recommend it to any ernest fan out there.i find myself to have great taste in movies and i'm sure anyone will enjoy this movie. in the movie ,(ernest) plays 2 roles, bad guy and good guy and plays them quite well. i really enjoy exaggeration type humor where things just seem impossible,like in the naked gun films for example, and there is plenty of it in this movie.i bought this movie right after i saw it. good directing, good script, worth renting.

this movie brings back so many memories for me! i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it! my dad and i would always watch the "ernest movies" together. we hadn't seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap. we watched them and could not stop laughing. i love all of the "ernest movies," but this one is my favorite.spoiler part! the part i remember most is the "magnet" part. my dad still does the electric chair scene! end spoiler!this is a very cheesy movie...but a great one! it's perfect for families (it isn't like a lot of the trash out there) but at the same time adults can laugh too! if you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move) then this is the movie for you!

i love ernest goes to jail. it's one of my top 3 favorite ernest movies. the others being ernest scared stupid and ernest goes to camp. in this movie ernest (jim varney) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer felix nash (varney also) knocks him out and switches places with him! soon ernest is in jail and is forced to act like nash or else nash will kill charlotte ernest's love interest. when they take ernest to the electric chair thinking he's nash he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves charlotte from the evil nash! filled with hilarious scenes and comics ernest goes to jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! it still does to me! jim varney was such a fantastic actor! he did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! varney was like his toy story co star tom hanks. no matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that varney's gonna be remembered forever for! r.i.p. jim varney 1949-2000. thank you for bringing ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!

the last good ernest movie, and the best at that. how can you not laugh at least once at this movie. the last line is a classic, as is ernest's gangster impressions, his best moment on film. this has his best lines and is a crowning achievement among the brainless screwball comedies.

if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie, and don't act like that sort of thing doesn't happen all time, it would be this one.all of the ernest movies are entertaining, but the best ones are the ones that have jim varney doing a number of different characters. additionally, i am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of bill byrge and gailard sartain as brothers chuck and bobby tulip. "ernest goes to jail" contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actors.and that is why i have chosen "ernest goes to jail" as the king of all ernest movies. disagree with me if you must, but deep down you know i am right.

this time, the lovable dimwit gets summoned for jury duty, where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out, so the two get switched. of course, most of the movie is a series of gags; in "ernest goes to jail", most of the gags relate to electricity. i really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on. overall, the point of the movie is just to have fun, and i'm sure that you will. this is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud. it's quite safe to say that jim varney will truly be missed. knowwhaddamean? fyi: the only other cast member whom i recognized was randall "tex" cobb, who played lyle. you've surely seen him somewhere.

i watched this movie only because i didn't want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves. honestly, i went in expecting to enjoy a good nap -- but found myself entranced by the movie. i'd recommend it to anyone who asks! roy's mom was on one of my all-time favorite tv shows years ago, playing a mermaid (maximum bob). she was really cute in this movie. the three main characters were all excellent young actors. also enjoyed seeing and hearing jimmy buffet. the movie itself was quite beautiful - showcasing some of what makes florida so great. i'm glad i ended up going to this movie. and to think, i was disappointed that i couldn't take them to see "stick it" -- i think this was much better!

this film was not great cinema, but definitely a good film to see with your family, especially children from 10-15. there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie, such as bullies, the environment, and working to make things right. jimmy buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful... the young actors were excellent, and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel. except for a few words in the dialog, a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom. hopefully it will be shown in drive-ins this summer so that more people get to see it. it did follow carl hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance.

logan lerman & dean collins iii of jack & bobby fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on jack & bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie.logan lerman may be seemingly typecast in roles of being "different" as thusly seen from here as is seen in this as well as in jack and bobby.the movie also opens up with a very nice tune coined as a lost 45 "and i'm wondering where the lions are?"a song which i'd always heard on the speaker @ my old job of christmastreeshops and got it played on my local radio show of the lost45s hosted by barry scott but the last time of which i suggested this with this movie as it's dedication but the dedication was left out.environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this movie too.what a hoot too this movie is.hoot,sogive a hoot in the tradition of the woodsey owl commercials of the 1970s too. truthfully, stephen "steve" g. baer a.k.a."ste".

hoot is the best movie. go and see it if you haven't about these 3 kids that stand up to the right and the wrong. a perfect family film. the characters mullet fingers ( cody linley) beatrice leep (brie larson) and roy eberhardt ( logan lerman) are the three main characters. great movie the best!!!!!!!!!!! i love this movie and you guys should too, its a great movie i mean it a great movie. go and see it if you haven't. i like it because they stand up to the right and wrong, and it has cut owls and the hot cody linley.cody linley is so hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love him so much!!!!!!

i read the book before i saw the movie i knew the movie was going to be good because the book was great i seriously recommend you see this amazing fantastic movie. i know you will like it. when i went to see it i was there with my sister and there was nobody that was with us i was a little disappointed but nobody that i know has gone in to that movie and came out saying that was a horrible movie. nobody can it is so great i think everyone will like it (to bad nobody wants to see it) anyway i hope from what you have heard about this movie from me will make you want to see this movie i guarantee you'll like it as much as i do (im obsessed) literlly i am

the story is incredible, it begins with a new kid in town named roy, while on the bus to school, he notices a kid running with no shoes, and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him. roy soon discovers that kid is a runaway, and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight, that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. roy decides to help them him there fight, can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop dave delinko(luke wilson) stumbles on to them. an enjoyable film, funny and adventurous. i do admire luke wilson for taking this role. i don't think his brother owen would even take this role.

in "hoot", a new kid arrives to florida from montana. he first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully. soon, though, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town, right where a number of burrowing owls live. this movie has the look of a family film, but it is pretty more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetically how roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking (including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls, no less). now, one might agree or not with those actions, but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions. a good, solid film, all in all.

i saw the movie "hoot" and then i immediately decided to comment it. the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! this movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. when i was twelve, i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that i might harm them actually. (i am currently 15) what so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and enjoy!

this is a good family movie with a few laughs. i wish it didn't have too much of the school stuff like the bully in it to fill the movie up. also, it seems a little too easy to save a piece of land from being built. i mean, the it just flowed too easily. it does make you aware of the wildlife. it had a cute way of introducing the piece of land which the fast runner but a little too slow for me. a little too hokey for me and it reminded me of going back to school. oh, the dvd is chock full of goodies so don't miss out. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out 10 for the dvd with the extras that is well worth to watch. well worth your time to see this!

the swedish filmmaker roy andersson's latest film you, the living is not easy to review. one of the reasons is that in his own words he has broken with the anglo-saxon tradition of story-telling, in all essence the template of most western film productions. another reason might be that although roy andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolisms, his, unlike those of, say, andrei tarkovsky, are of a more elusive nature. it took him 3 years to complete this 86 minute long film and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial troubles or problems with the actors. the film consists of 57 vignettes shot mostly by a still camera, and it was the careful design of each of these scenes which required much time. the imagery of this film which is closely related to the director's previous film songs from the second floor is of utmost importance to the story, thus this story is told to a great degree by the surroundings and the environment in which the characters of andersson's universe dwell and interact. before each scene was finally shot, there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors, colors, dialog etc. the result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world which most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream, why not dream a little? just like in bunuel's the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie, when somebody says "last night i had a dream", you get to watch it. but then again, what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams.despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as such, the different characters who appear and reappear in different scenes still meet each other and their stories are inevitably intertwined. what most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. the trailer trash chain smoking and binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorbike so that she can get away from "all this crap", her corpulent and mostly silent boyfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but rather absent-minded mother, members of a brass band whose skill improving efforts at home aren't getting a favorable reception neither from their families nor their neighbors, the depressed middle eastern hairdresser and his arrogant customer on his way to "a very important business meeting", an elderly man having a nightmare about bombers in the skies, a young girl dreaming about marrying the young rock star that she is so madly in love with. it's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality but it works as much as a statement in support of the austrian philosopher ludwig wittgenstein's claims that "all human communication is miscommunication". people speak to each other but it is as if they speak past each other. they try to reach out to the others but shut the others out when those try to reach them.you, the living is a poetic film set physically in stockholm but yet universally applicable. the society it portrays is sweden, its artistic language and the people displayed are generally unmistakably nordic. yet, the subject it deals with, namely, the misery of the humankind in a selfish world, reaches far beyond this hemisphere. despite the seriousness of its theme, the film itself seems a lot more cheerful and laden with humor than one might have expected. but in the words of the director himself "living is so complicated to each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". hence, this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivities, and not a depressing black reality tour of the human nature. it is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will certainly find this film both entertaining and meaningful at the same time. it was shown at this year's cannes festival as part of the un certain regard program which offers "original and different works" outside the competition. after the film was shown in the salle debussy, the 1,000 strong audience gave it a standing ovation for several minutes. do i need to say more?

i've already seen spin-offs of cartoons such as the flintstones, scooby doo, tom and jerry and looney tunes and most of them are great.when i saw the all grown up pilot in 2001, i thought it was interesting to see how the rugrats would look in their pre-teens/teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert, going to school and being grounded.the actual tv show is better because the rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and angelica doesn't get punished as much as she did in the original rugrats series. tommy and susie get punished in this series.i've also noticed references to rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the rugrats looked in the original series. they actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older.this show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original rugrats. viewers of the original show may like this.

this is an excellent movie and i wish that they would put it out on dvd for people to purchase. it is difficult to try to catch it on tv all the time. as you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it. can someone tell me what file company make it so i can write to them and see if they will release it to the public? i only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and i only got to see it once last year. my sisters and i are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos. john denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great. they put out some much older movies and i think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and i think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on dvd.

my wife and i saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again. it was so moving that i was calling it a tear jerker. the mystery that billings was sent to report on is really no mystery at all. angles!! it seems that ever time he turned around something happened to him, all good, and i believe it scared george a bit, considering that he did not realize what he had gotten into. it just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around. if only we all could treat each other the same, the world would be a better place.to date we have been searching the net for a copy of it, now i finally have a connection to it, as soon as i can find a copy to buy i am going to grab it.

the joy and tragedy of the christmas season lies in the fact that it mostly revolves around family. that is why some people call it "the children's holiday." as we age, natural attrition and progress removes the people and the things that gave us our special memories. john denver, in one of his sweetest roles, plays george billings, a successful nyc architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier. his life is focused around his 9 year old daughter, alex; both are still grieving their loss. george is trying his best to make this a special christmas for his daughter. enter his boss, thomas renfield (roguishly played by the wonderful col. flagg of m*a*s*h guy, edward winters), who sends george to georgetown, co to explore a possible real estate deal. lying to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a vacation rather than work, george and alex fly into town, where they're immediately met by a collection of loving generous but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose main eccentricity is that they all believe in santa claus. georgetown is a picture book community we'd all love to live in and we'd love the people for neighbors. george soon meets a love interest in susan (jane kazmarek.) were it not for the grinch (renfield) it would be an ideal time. but the fact is, he is in town to find property for renfield to develop, and there is a nice ranch near town about to be foreclosed, and the dark edges of the movie revolve around the impending foreclosure and the reactions of the townies, the rancher, and the outsiders. i won't spoil the ending for those who've never seen the movie. it's a typical happy christmas ending, but it's handled in a fairly subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy. all in all, this is a most pleasant way to spend a couple of your christmas tv hours. john denver and jane kazmarek have nice chemistry and gennie james as alex does a real nice job. i've always loved the work of mary wickes, a recognizable character actress, and all of the other cast members do a nice job with less meaty parts. this is a regular christmas fare for my family; i rate it 4/5.

this movie is my families favorite christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what christmas is really all about. these days living in a big city which i hate, i love to watch movies about the life i've always dreamed of having. the town that this movie is set in is my dream come true for the life i've always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in todays society. i truly don't feel the true spirit of christmas anymore but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again. my family taped this movie long ago of tv and now our copy has been worn out so i would really like to buy a few copies on dvd for my family and me if anyone can tell me where i can buy some copies please just post the info here and i will keep checking. thanks.

just watched it on the hallmark channel. i was surprised to john denver! this movie was full of clich√©s, but that is to be expected (a made for tv christmas movie- come on!) the acting is as good as any other '80's made for tv movie. the story is, as i said before, predictable and clich√©, but still good. if you are looking for a campy christmas movie, it will certainly scratch your itch.i was also pleased when i learned that it took place in georgetown, colorado. it is a real mountain town west of denver. very cool as this is my home region.i was never a big john denver fan (i always found him to be pretty foney) but he was a decent actor. he is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film.if you get the chance to watch it, than do. i'm sure it will be on again in 2007.

it was good to see john denver again though he passed several years ago. i found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what christmas is all about. the scenes of georgetown, colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately. as i sit here in my own mountain seen in so california i loved the story and the plot. i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did. merry christmas! a great film for all the family too see. enoy and tell others about it. thanks for the memories. we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood.

even if i had never seen or heard of georgetown, co, this would be a sweet little movie. but my dad was born and raised there, and those are my uncle's horses you see pulling the sleigh! so this movie is very special to me. a lot of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses i recognize, and are very realistic. the story is a little hokey, but georgetown is that kind of magical place where things like that could happen. john denver was a better actor than a lot of people give him credit for. mary wickes plays the kind of "common-sense lady with a lot of sass" she played so well in many other films, most notably "white christmas". i usually don't get to go out there in the winter, so i like to see this movie at christmas time to "tide me over" until my next trip!

my santa lucia choir was chosen to be in this movie. all 100 plus. when it came time to film the movie i was asked to chose just 10. oh my goodness. we had a little gal who went early to have her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie. the choices were hard to make. the people of georgetown are just a lovely as the people that they show in the movie. gracious, kind, believers. the town sponsors an annual christmas market the first two weekend in december every year. i was there this year and it was wonderful. the town is lovely and the people work hard to make it magical. the town appears today as it did when the movie was made. much credit goes to the historical society there that work hard to maintain the historical value. the principal of the school that has been turned into a charter school was given an award by the governor of colorado for volunteers.

i just finished watching the movie tonight and i truly loved it. john denver didn't play a pastor, but it was the reverend of the little town who decided to leave the floor for john denver to speak. it's a really great movie with a wonderful christmas message. it was also fun to watch.

this is an excellent movie and should be presented every year during the holidays @ christmas! beautiful with great acting. john denver at his best, i,e, sincere, kind, talented, and natural. the town is georgetown, colorado and every bit as lovely as in the story.

the great news is that this film is now available on dvd from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video.this is good news as it is one of my favourite films!i watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing. living in the small market town called tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions,of reenactments,and traditions we are also a cosy tight community. we are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the community and you can see why i love this film first of all-and most important, there are lashings of snow!!!! then there is the lovely legend of the christmas tree and also the christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. the evil developers-only after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have , which is very special. i love the way the whole community send their message to santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero . he and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (there is a likely candidate for this)-even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on christmas morning and no-one had engineered it! there is a lovely moment where denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. great gentle film for everything christmas is really about.

living just down the hwy from georgetown, co...i remember this movie well and thought it was great! the story seems like something john would do even in real life, but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie. for those of you who don't live in denver...every christmas, the city of denver, co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the civic center in downtown denver. well...as it so happened, during the filming of this movie, a nativity scene was needed. so...it was borrowed from the civic center display...with permission, by the way! someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be, and it was reported stolen! a frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days. finally, someone spoke up and remembered loaning it to the film crew in georgetown! it was returned and put back where it belonged! as it turns out...it wasn't featured all that much in the movie...you can barely see it during the christmas show with the children. it did create quit a disturbance though...

my entire family enjoyed this film, including 2 small children. great values without sex, violence, drugs, nudity, or profanity. also no zillion dollar special effects were added to try to misdirect viewers from a poorly written storyline. a simple little family fun movie. we especially like the songs in the movie. but we only got to hear a portion of the songs ... mostly during the end credits... would love to buy a sound track cd from this movie. this is my 4th bill hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. with all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to watch, this hillman fella has a no risk rating. we love his movies.

seeing gary busey in a g rated film was a first and a nice one at that. i don't know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. where did jillian clare come from? my kids love her! the only thing i remember christopher atkins doing was blue lagoon. disney needs to see this film and put him to work. the wife thinks he is very cute. i liked what he did with his character. he seemed so real. what we liked most was the message this film sends out. greed sucks and faith, love and family wins! this is the first low-budget dvd we've bought that had so much stuff on it. the producers made this one for kids and the kids loved it. they liked the music and all the extras on the dvd. the director probably won't stick to family movies, but i hope he does - cause he really knows how to get the most out of kids, animals and stars like gary busey. the dog was great and seeing gary busey act like a dog was even funnier. there wasn't much we didn't like about this one. it hard to find a family film without all the crude humor, and quigley was a delightful surprise.

this is a quiet movie. it's a simple story about a writer who cannot write his story coming back to his home town to get started but instead he gets involved in a friendship with a weird older man whose life externally represents perhaps the internal state of the writer - it's a museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people.there are no extraordinary circumstances or any big movements in the plot. it's a movie about internal changes. being stuck in their lives which are not developing much, the principal personages get to help each other to transform, stop leaving in dreams and achieve something or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and long-awaited new direction.on the film-making side i can think of only one weakness which could also be considered as a feature - we do not get much of characters description or inner world insights. it's very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about their true feelings which are rather hidden but still you can see them, and this is what makes your own mind work, trying to figure them out, to understand the impressions made by those people, and it's not empty underneath - the actors definitely hold well some inner states proper to their characters. it's close to the real life where you mostly never know someone well enough to understand them completely, and this turns us around and puts in front of our own feelings and choices.what's most important for me is that this simple almost flat story leaves you pondering afterwards, about your own life, about your own dreams and achievements, are there any or are we caught up in the routine and pleasures, leaving at 100% or only dreaming about it, could we do more and move somewhere we'd rather like to be than just leaving feed ourselves and others the tales like "i'll do this one day"- not moving one finger to make this actually happen, or "i'm fine where i am" because it's easier to go by the habits than to actually make a change? at least that's the impression it left me with and it was very timely for me, which adds to my appreciation of this far-from-famous movie. i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies meant for the heart but those who need events and actions should stay away.

i just watched the movie tonight and i found it brilliant. it doesn't have special effects that blow your mind, and it's not violent or bloody, no terrorist or aliens but it's brilliant. it's just plain nice, sweet and it brought me to a whole different time, a much simpler time, where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out at the ocean. i think it was beautiful and i for one recommend it. nick was a great character and his friendship with harry was one of the highlights of the movie. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but i believe everyone should watch this, mostly when they feel down, or when they want to share something nice with their friends.

i saw farewell to harry at the plaza theatre while in new york city and was quite taken. the performance of william hall jr. is tremendous. this is a movie for the classic movie goer. garrett bennett's direction reminds me of early barry levinson and robert redford's work. the movie seems to transcend the typical independent film. it has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique. i saw this with a small audience (400) who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and although i wasn't out and out crying (like the lady next to me) i do have to admit i had a little watering in the eyes...

rosie perez is the lead in this very engaging affair, cast as mercedes, a young woman from brooklyn who has resolved to become a film actress although not favoured by her circumstances, living in east los angeles and struggling with a series of fruitless auditions for any sort of part at all. mercedes has hooked up with a married and washed-up actor, harry harrelson (harvey keitel), who at one time had performed in a television western series during the 1970s, and seldom since, accepting him as her lover, in part from loneliness, and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his "contacts", but these latter are of small consequence as harry is simply self-delusional in his attempts at recovering what he perceives as past cinematic renown. in order to adequately support herself financially, mercedes toils as a taxi dancer in a downtown los angeles skid row dance hall/bar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business, and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from mexico, ernesto (michael delorenzo), falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections, even if they may mean losing her altogether. this essentially tradition rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget, despite the presence of a goodly number of well-known players, including steve buscemi, anthony quinn, and stanley tucci, and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather desultory distribution and leaden marketing efforts on its behalf, more's the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by alexandre rockwell's admirably controlled direction, a consistent virtue of his work, and on display in this film from its very opening scene, frames that form a montage behind the credits, featuring perez at skid row's fifth and main streets. rockwell has often demonstrated that he operates very closely indeed with his cast, and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is neatened nicely via the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director, despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators. the film's scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by tito larriva, who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers. acting honours here must go to the ever vital perez, although nary a sub-par performance is turned in. a fair test for any film's quality is given when a viewer will watch it twice within a brief period. sitting through this undervalued work will be considered a keen pleasure for many.

the three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: ernesto, hopelessly devoted to mercedes. this was part of the frustration: screaming at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good harry, to no avail.then there's the satisfaction: steve buscemi has a great part as a transvestite, and harvey keitel's moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible. when you least expect it, quentin tarintino is doing half a monologue, and anthony quinn turns ernesto into a wealthy man.time and again great moments appear in the story, but in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie. it doesn't have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but it somehow feels right.this movie is strange, but then so am i; no wonder i liked it.

excellent special effects make this disaster move very plausible. one can see that the producers went to some trouble to get the displays on the computer screens just right - it all makes it very convincing. the sets are also very authentic looking. a good choice of music rounds off the film nicely.acting is good and the presence of david suchet adds some weight to the cast of course. compared to other movies of this genre, flood is right up there with the best of them. thankfully, the "human drama" aspect has not been overdone, as is often the case with this type of movie. the human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual flooding scenes.and of course, the movie confirms what many of us suspect anyway: weather forecasters so often do not get it right! :)

a fine ironic visual gag takes place in front of the spectacular backdrop of a twirling windmill. but who are those people who rush across screen at the end: customers? relatives? one of the earliest enigmas in cinematic history perhaps. well worth a minute of your time.

okay, if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema, it wouldn't be particularly worthwhile. however, in 1898, films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tell--instead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities. if seen today, almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very, very short--often less than one minute long! and so in light of this, this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh. two guys, a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each other--falling and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle. that's all--the film is over before you know it.

i absolutely, positively loved the movie. i just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on dvd. it is a beautifully, well-drawn masterpiece. i am always amazed with the intricately drawn work of ghibli studios. others have commented on sosuke calling risa by her first name. he never calls his father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else. i didn't get the impression that risa was his mother. it was never even mentioned or implied by anyone. it is quite obvious that she is his step-mother. that is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car. his mother must have died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by risa. this coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has abandonment issues. everyone also talks about how mature he is. this usually occurs when a child loses a parent.

rendered in beautiful water colors, ponyo at the cliff is definitely a sight to behold, vaguely remembering the trailer, witch i didn't find that impressive, i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. this film just washed over me with its purity.at the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature, and its their relationship that carries the movie. miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones interacting in a believable way with their little quirks intact.there are a few parts that didn't sit well with me. it would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene "resembled" ride of the valkyrians, its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene. the antagonist and its back-story never interested me either, but i guess it served more as a background then anything else.anyway, great film. the boat trip scenario with all its imagery and sea-creatures stood out me thinks. pure and magical. and yes, handrawn artwork is more intimate then computer animated, i'm really pumped for princes and the frog now.

miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and it's only been recently that his movies have made it american shores via disney and fans fawning over his great talent. ponyo is no exception. although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to us audiences, some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort-of "japanese" in its presentation. for the same reason pom poko is very "japanese" and doesn't make much sense to us audiences, so too are *some* elements of ponyo. this should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth, hope, and friendship.what does come across well is miyazaki's very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy. that coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters. he steps out of his zone a bit with ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas. although not lonely, sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea. similar to spirited away, we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and i feel that miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different.i managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot. miyazaki has claimed that "this is my last movie" for many years but shortly after spirited away, he gave us howl's moving castle. ponyo is certainly proof that miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight, innovate, and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time. watch ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you'll be transported back to when catching fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown-up stuff and eating your vegetables.

obviously, ponyo can be seen as just not another stupid animated movie that a studio might put out to simply survive. it is far from it, and it can be easily described as a captivating, beautiful movie experience.miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. now, to many, this has been said to be the least of his achievements in film-making, due to in part of his "certain weirdness factor" not being there. that is true-the morals and insights that are not quite so evident in his previous films are very up front in this picture. ponyo is not too difficult to understand or comprehend. his idea, i believe, was to make a children's movie that was just as suitable for adults as their kids, and for it not to be too complicated. he accomplished this perfectly, and he also didn't lose any substance along the way, which is the reason it gets a 10.besides that, the film itself is so engrossing from the start, and the way its presented is so beautiful, it left me in awe at times because i remembered how they were all hand-drawn by miyazaki himself. i haven't been so enlightened and happy after seeing a film since i saw once a while back (another film not to be missed). everything about ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music for it was pure perfection. the only bad thing i have to say about it was its english dubbing. don't get me wrong, they were good, too, but i had seen ponyo about 2 weeks before it came out nationally, and i believed that, in some parts, i wish it had kept some of its japanese dialogue (not all of it, though; did enjoy the "english way" too). all in all, everyone should see ponyo; it's absolutely flawless and in another league of film-making altogether. finally, and don't hold me to this, but i wouldn't be surprised if ponyo got a best picture nomination, as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it. it's just that good.

gake no ue no ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless cgi movies being made. the pastel and color pencil backgrounds were a surprise after sen to chihiro no kamikakushi(spirited away) and hauru no ugoku shiro(howl's moving castle) being so similar stylistically. the style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. the time and effort put in to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life, the detail and care it takes makes the movie turn out so much better. there are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action. the greatest to me being a scene were ponyo's sisters transform into massive wave like fish while she runs on top of them. the story is simple but fairly well written and played out. the plot stayed focused around character relationships and while it wasn't played out as well as in tonari no totoro(my neighbor totoro) it is still great. i felt that each character had the an appropriate amount of screen time unlike spirited away which was so jammed with distinctive characters that it could have been stretched out into an entire series.(the radish spirit. there was a another whole movie right there!) my only real problem with the movie was the end. the way its worded in the english version at least makes it seem like there's going to be some great test given to s≈çsuke which turns out to be just him promising ponyos mother that he will love ponyo. though putting more thought into this leads me to think that translation may not be that accurate to the actual meaning in that the test is the promise and that deep down he really means it. the movie did seem to end abruptly though. other than that the movie was great and i highly recommend it.

it's rare for a film to sweep you away within its world and leave you wanting more once the credits roll. hayao miyazaki's ponyo is such a film.the film is the story of a young goldfish named ponyo who wishes to become human. she swims to shore and is found by a young boy named sasuke who promises to take care of her. course ponyo's father, an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named fujimoto, tries to keep ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which is eventually upturned when ponyo finally transforms into a little girl, causing a massive typhoon.ponyo is a very rich film. it is full of wondrous fantasy, lovable characters, and genuine heart. what director hayao miyazaki has done here is tell a simple little story, and while so doing creating authentic movie magic.ponyo is an enchanting experience. the love between sasuke and ponyo is very pure and true. as well the environmentalist within miyazaki is still as evident within this film as in all his previous works. miyazaki shows the filth and grime that fall into the ocean in an almost startling light, not to mention ponyo's father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. while the story is simple, miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with expert proficiency.the film is a beautiful work of art, each hand drawn cell looks like a wondrous pastel painting. the film looks very different than many other studio ghibli productions, but the artistry is still just as spectacular as ever before. the scenes underwater are simply beautiful to watch, fujimoto's fortress under the sea is highly inventive, and the sequence where ponyo runs across the jumping fish within the typhoon to reach sosuke is iconic.course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience. sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he actually is, and the energetic ponyo is a laugh a minute. every character is just so enjoyable and highly memorable.overall ponyo is a wondrous experience, enchanting in every single way. while the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale, i believe many adults will be swept away within its fantastic world along with their children. while the film may lack the density of some of miyazaki's previous works, here he keeps it pure and simple, being true to himself, delivering a film that is funny, heartwarming, and entertaining all in one. this is a magnificent film.i give ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!

my first exposure to japanese animation director hayao miyazaki and his studio ghibli production company was when an english-dubbed version of spirited away was released about 7 years ago. what a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was! so on that note, i managed to get my movie theatre-employed friend to see this new film of miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things disney (this movie's u.s. distributor). once again, all i can say is "wow!" what awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean...and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to...and seeing how some characters' demeanor changes...and, well, watch this movie if you want to know what i'm talking about. oh, and the voices being used for this american-dubbed version: tina fey, betty white, liam neeson, cloris leachman, and lily tomlin. good choices all. does everything make sense? no, but that's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout. there's plenty of funny scenes concerning ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter. oh, i think i've written too much so i'll just highly recommend hayao miyazaki's ponyo.

ponyo, written and directed by hayao miyazaki, is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for humans young and old, and respect for cultural differences. it is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl, rather than a retelling of disney's little mermaid. miyazaki has animated by hand, a whimsical, magical film for the young and the young-at- heart. the film begins with a slow undulating blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and scores of little fanciful goldfish with childlike faces. there isn't any need for narrative, the motion of the creatures and the music of jo hisaiahi tell the beginning. released last summer in japan, ponyo won the japanese academy's award for best animation film and best score (jezebel.com). the fanciful little goldfish, brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. upon reaching the surface she is caught up in a fishing net full of other fish, garbage, and sludge. she is propelled into a jar, which is rolled to shore where five-year-old sosuke (voice by frankie jonas) retrieves it. he cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish. brunhild tastes his blood, which heals sosuke's cut, and puts in motion her transformation to a human, at the same time throwing nature out of balance. sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green pail and names her ponyo (noah cyrus), meaning soft and jelly like. sosuke's mother, lisa (tina fey), lets him take ponyo to school, which is right next door to the nursing home where she works. lisa's crazy driving down the picturesque winding road, past a dry dock, through the bustling fishing town, and up a tree-lined road to the nursing home is representative of miyazaki's wonderful sequence of action and illustrates perfectly a parent's hectic morning. miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female character in lisa. making her a loving, sensible, modern mother both to sosuke and ponyo. lisa's telephone conversation with the not-coming-home-again husband, kiochi (matt damon) because the ship he captains must make another run, is a typical wife's reaction. later that evening sosuke intercedes using a signal lamp to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff their house sits on. lisa refuses to acknowledge kiochi's apology and jumps up and signals "bug-off, bug-off, bug-off," it is a hilarious scene. but, when sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his dad "good luck, love you," lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart, it is a very poignant scene.my personal favorites are miyazaki's elderly, granny-type women in wheelchairs at the nursing home, yochi (betty white), noriko (cloris leachman) and toki (lily tomlin). their interchange over sosuke's little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bickering between the witch of the waste (lauren bacall) and sophie (jean simmons) as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in howl's moving castle. ponyo's magical sea-god father, fujimoto (liam neeson) resembling the wizard howl arrives to take ponyo back to her ocean home. fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try and put nature back in balance, but magical little ponyo escapes again upsetting more elixir in the process, and causing a tsunami. running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to sosuke, this redheaded, little girl reminds the audience of the stubborn, adventurous little mei in my neighbor totoro. ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as mei. when fujimoto realizes what ponyo has done he calls for gran mamare (kate blanchett), the goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. this wise, calming goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends. she has a private talk with lisa discussing the future of the young children, which helps the audience understand sosuke and ponyo's relationship is not that of lovers, but of brother and sister. the life-goes-on quiet simple ending is typical of miyazaki films leaving the audience full of hope.

even from the very commencing title of this movie i really love the artwork and canvas layout of one of the national islands of japan. we see some great rolling green hills and some oriental houses of a coastal town. instantly we are looking at the pacific beauty on the widescreen of the theater. and to prove how great this film is, i have to say that charles darwin would be proud. teachers of evolution classes and school sciences such as biology would fantastically favor hayao miyazaki's brand new movie entitled "ponyo". the title character, as you will see, may be the perfect animation icon of media to be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums alike.besides the scientific aspect of all this, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. we have a skinny, old and powerful sorcerer named fujimoto who lives in a submersible and is cynical of the urban expansion of mankind and their pollution of industrial waste. he wants to have complete control of the seas and the cute looking peaceful aquatic life including fish and organisms. fujimoto, whose blood is composed to be half-human and half-amphibious, resembles both an ocean loving anti-hero and antagonist; similar to the james bond villain stromberg in the spy who loved me who operates an atlantis-dubbed underwater city. his daughter, whom he treats like an over-cared-for pet, is named ponyo. she is a large goldfish who already looks like a pretty red-haired girl. the father bans her from the real human world, claiming it to be dangerous and too much for her to handle. but quite frankly, ponyo's exploratory curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature. eventually with building strength, similar to wonderful scenes from nick park's "chicken run", she breaks free of her father's rocky and fossilized aquatic city and swims to the water surface of japan, and to her luck and joy, falls into the caring hands of a youngster ship tanker captain named sosuke. living in an ocean front house at a neat looking beach (or boulder filled beach), sosuke has two overworking parents, a senior home working mother lisa and the first mate of a tanker barge koichi. lisa seems to be angry at her spouse for being away on a ship and leaving her with all the housework. even more so, the black magic that is exerted by ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur: the moon approaches the earth too closely and waves surge from the unbalancing of the tidal interaction forces, and humongous tsunami waves rack the peaceful but evacuated town. however what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than supernatural might is the love and tightly embraced friendship between the childish captain sosuke and the adorable red-headed ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive human than just a preserved fish. much like the frizzly haired and free-spirited hobbits in the lord of the rings, ponyo grants me a slight reminder of that.i could write on and on about this amazing animated film, the best since "coraline" which was in theaters in february. and right now, hayao miyazaki, feast your eyes on another 10 star grade from your animation fan, graham abraham. the year 2009 may be filled with dozens of animated films; however, ponyo is the most towering film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.

this is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom battling that went on to choose a successor to johnny carson on the tonight show. however, the movie's ultimate thesis, that david letterman's superior comedic talents were overlooked because of his controversial nature, and the show diminished by the enthronement of an inferior jay leno in the leading comedy program on television is simply untrue, as anyone who has watched both leno and letterman perform can see for themselves. the hard and simple truth is exactly as one nbc exec stated in the film "jay leno is the funniest man in america." and david letterman is not. once you realize this, then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant. ultimately, the whole film amounts to little more than sour grapes by letterman fans, who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things. the final proof is that despite letterman's early lead, possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for tonight show succession, leno's show has consistently proved to be the more popular, thus, in my mind at least, refuting letterman's claims to be unfairly robbed of his rightful inheritance.

good movie, great story, great characters, i enjoyed it immensely, enough to buy the dvd when it came out. the real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the fictionalizers could ever come up with. my friend who is in the media business said they shouldn't show insider dealings like this, it gives the business a bad name. as if.there are a few problems with the dvd though: first, the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the tv volume to watch it. i notice that its also like that when hbo runs it so its in the original production copy. second, for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off, that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side. after the five minutes it fills the screen properly, left to right. sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and i don't know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by.still, even with the technical flaws, its an enjoyable story, one of hbo's best i think.

tv movies generally do not receive as much recognition or credit as great films - and it is usually for good reason but the 1996 hbo movie the late shift is easily one of the best tv movies ever. based on bill carter's revealing book, the late shift is about nbc's handling of late night talk show hosts david letterman and jay leno when it came to filling the vacant tonight show seat once held by johnny carson. we see what happens in front of the camera - author bill carter, director betty thomas, and hbo show us what happened when the cameras were turned off.unfortunately we can never really know for sure what really happened when it came time for johnny carson to be replaced by either letterman or leno - but the late shift gives us an interesting possible reality. while simply being a very well made film, the late shift also does a really good job of portraying all the sides fairly equally - although you wonder if the film makes letterman and leno out to be too nice of guys; especially leno, who seems a bit too saintly.the performances are also very good. in a very deserving golden globe-winning performance, kathy bates plays leno's extremely pushy manager helen kushnick who, according to carter and the book/film was very problematic for the studio and leno (the real kushnick actually suited bill carter for libel over this portrayal!). john michael higgins breaks out of his usual gigs of getting small quirky comedy parts and gives an excellent performance as david letterman - giving an excellent impression of letterman but also creating a dimensional and relatable character. daniel roebuck gives a good performance as leno but does not quite measure up to some of the other talent in the film - roebuck probably did the best anyone could have done, it is just looks hammy whenever anyone tries to do an impression or portrayal of leno. bob balaban (a squirrelly warren littlefield), treat williams (a magician-like michael ovitz), and ed begley jr.(a pompous rod perth) also give memorable supporting performances.the late shift certainly is one of the best made-for-tv movies i have ever seen. i suppose if one has not watched david letterman or jay leno, the late shift might not be for them but it is an interesting film for those who get into the late night politics - something that has recently reared its ugly head yet again with the 2009-10 conan/leno/nbc debacle.

i don't even like watching those late night talk shows, but i found this one really interesting. i imagine it's probably close to the truth---it "feels" like an honest account, if that means anything. kinda feel for the people somewhat when you watch it. a nice movie for a saturday night.

i read the book written by bill carter on which this movie is based many years ago. the book is certainly stronger than the movie. it provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide, the end result being that i thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items. all things considered, though, and given the limitations of the medium, the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between jay leno and david letterman in the early 90's to host "the tonight show" after the retirement of johnny carson.the highlight is clearly the performances. i can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well-known and on tv on a regular basis. john michael higgins nailed the part of letterman perfectly. watching him really was like watching letterman. daniel roebuck tried valiantly to be jay leno, but somehow didn't pull it off as effectively. his whole "look" seemed fake, and he just didn't seem natural in the role. in a less central role, rich little not surprisingly nailed the voice of carson, although the look was a bit off. in the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably leno's agent, helen kushnick. in the movie, kathy bates was perfect in the role, although not quite as out of control as carter's portrayal of the woman in writing.in the end, this is light and entertaining viewing. the subject matter isn't especially important in the overall scheme of things, but it's a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry. 7/10

***spoilers*** this film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of johnny carson to determine who would succeed him. the impersonations of david letterman and jay leno are performed in a satisfactory way by john michael higgins and daniel roebuck, though the performances weren't great. reni santoni is the best-performing of the "execs" (he plays john agoglia of nbc), and warren littlefield (played by bob baliban) is a close second. i was shocked at the way in which littlefield eagerly discussed dumping johnny carson. this was johnny carson! this scene evinces the cut-throat, what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of television. kathy bates delivered the best performance of the film as jay's agent, helen kushnick. another commenter asserted that leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. i respectfully disagree. the relationship with kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence. she orders him around, and, when he rebels against her at the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when jay terminates their relationship, she turns violent again, screaming "don't you leave me, you two-faced bastard!" before smashing a picture on the floor. overall, the movie is hilarious, and i wish that it were shown more often.

the directing is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (though i would've loved to have seen a little more of aaron lustig (from y & r fame), who played paul shaffer). i only have two minor quips about the film, as subtle as they are. one- roebuck's leno is excellent, but his stage presence (i.e. during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes) is a tad underwhelming. two- the distribution of the foul language. i am willing to tolerate foul language, so long as it is not used gratuitously, and to a degree, the film was gratuitous. the language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of bates' otherwise well-portrayed kushnick by her frequent use of it, and served to make roebuck's leno a goody-goody by his lack of use of it (of course, if the characters really did behave this way, kudos to everybody). nonetheless, the piece is an excellent one, as far as television and video are concerned. the film, i feel, had potential for the big screen, but would've required re-casting for the bit parts, and probably a different director, as well (the aesthetic feel is that of the larry sanders show, good for hbo, mediocre for cinematic purposes).

i think this movie actually has a lot of nice things to say about a lot of people (johnny carson, ted koppel), and it shows that letterman and leno actually liked and respected each other a lot. treat williams as the half-kung fu master, half-godfather-like mike ovitz is terrific.

over the years i've watched this movie many times from seeing it on "hbo" and i now own a copy on dvd. i must say it's very memorable and entertaining in the meantime it's interesting and educational too. as any tv fan can relate to the time of the early 90's when the time came up to replace johhny carson the tv living legend of "the tonight show" who's it gonna be jay or dave? this original film from hbo "the late shift" stays true to form and depicts the real events very well showing the behind the scenes battle between networks heads of nbc and cbs and even abc they were all fighting for the services of jay and dave. the acting makes it seem real as very little actual tv footage is shown with real life people as the actors portraying leno and letterman make it seem so real. i haven't read the bill carter book so i don't know if it stayed true to the pages, but i have highly enjoyed this film over the years. from the moment when it starts showing cbs entertainment heads watching leno sub for johhny and they decide they want to get in on the late night game. yet when carson announces his unexpected retirement nbc wants to stay loyal with leno yet conflict arrives when letterman wants a crack at the slot at 11:30 too. it was fun to watch the wacky meeting with michael ovitz(treat williams)who makes all networks want to consider letterman for a show. it was interesting to see the scene of johhny telling letterman by phone in a direct way to walk from nbc and consider cbs. and by the way rich little was terrific as johhny carson his portrayal couldn't be matched. and plenty of tense moments were provided by showing the bickering and firing of leno's talent manager helen which nbc heads pressured him to do. overall great film that showed what tv is really like and it proves that networks are power and money hungry while showing that's it's a cutthroat business. clearly there's no business like show business. great work from hbo very memorable and a watch anytime it showed the true story of the late night wars.

the late shift is a great book, i read the book several years ago, and i was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when johnny carson retired and jay leno and johnny carson tried to grab his spot. when the movie came out, i snagged a vhs copy of the movie, and having reread the book recently, it's hard to say which i enjoy more, because they're quite equal in the amount of information conveyed. the two lead actors, john michael higgins, and daniel roebuck, two actors i never heard of before, and haven't heard of since, play leno and letterman convincingly, despite letterman's dismissal of his portrayal as being poor. they play the parts quite well, despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two. i wasn't as interested in that. the story is what counts. and that brings me to kathy bates. kathy bates, playing helen kushnick, is this movie. she plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself, much less a national tv show. yikes! there should be a sequel!!

although a made for cable film by hbo, it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the back-stabbing and double-dealing world of television. allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the so-called late night talk show wars in the early 90s, as jay leno and david letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the tonight show. kathy bates gives a bravo performance as leno's mercurial manager helen kushnick and one can feel empathy for what leno/letterman endured at the hands of tv executives. it is just as timely now, considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by abc to replace nightline with letterman. no matter how many times i have seen this film, i still find it as much a pleasure to watch as i did when it first aired. if this should ever be released on dvd, i would certainly add it to my collection.

the late shift was an interesting made for hbo movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between david letterman and jay leno when johnny carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. this struggle is now part of hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that david letterman wanted to replace johnny carson as host of the tonight show more than anything in the world, but letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host leno had one of hollywood's most powerful agents, helen kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. it's not often that we get to see behind the scenes hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television. according to this movie, letterman was practically promised the job by carson himself while nbc had promised the job to leno and that's where helen kushnick came in. the movie presents leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of helen's strong-willed manipulations of some of nbc's biggest power players and it presents letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite having carson's support, was railroaded by nbc and kushnick. john michael higgins and daniel roebuck credibly recreate letterman and leno, respectively, but it is the razor-sharp performance of oscar winner kathy bates as helen kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling. bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the venomous hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. there is also a wonderful turn by impressionist rich little as johnny carson, but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by bates that make this one worth checking out.

alright, so maybe the impersonations of jay leno and david letterman are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. bob balaban and treat williams are excellant as warren littlefield and micheal ovitz.the movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny. kathy bates in particular is amazing as leno's manager.funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good tv movie.

as a former tv editor, i can say this is as authentic as it gets. it even led to letterman's producer (thought to be a source) resigning (eventually) in real life. letterman was outraged (ok, so one goofy thing is it has him throwing softballs at a tire swing on his estate; total fabrication) but the main information is hilariously true, from the silly bidding war for letterman once he decided to leave nbc to leno's problems with an agent who was not ready for big time, but who he let run the show (almost to a disastrous exit) out of his famed loyalty. if any of you kids don't grasp the idea of why letterman is jealous to this day, see this tape.

captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains. the movie follows the plight of david letterman and jay leno as they struggle for the elusive tonight show spot. letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and leno led by his agent and little-devil-on-the-shoulder, helen kushnick.kathy bates (kushnick) is excellent in this movie, alienating herself from such top dogs as bob wright, warren littlefield, and howard stringer. towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping, that you find yourself wanting more.john michael higgins (letterman) plays his part to the tee. at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real letterman.i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations.

i have just returned from santa fe. nm. i visited loretto chapel. as i looked around this building, which has been acquired by a private owner, i relived the movie version of the staircase. it is an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building. it is about what can happen if you really have faith. the bookstore there has a narrative on the subject, which is the story of the staircase. i read the narrative in its entirety. i was absorbed by the ambiance surrounding the people therein. it was like we were totally enclosed in a time warp, all with the same thoughts and awe. when we departed, the hush was overwhelming. everyone should visit loretto chapel in santa fe. nm.

excellent story with supperb acting by all of the cast. the warmth and insight into who joad represents moved off of the screen and into the heart of this viewer. the frustration's and tenacity of mother madalyn in her quest to do his work till her last breath was also done with excellance by barbara hershey. the intertwining of the personalities of joad and mother madalyn grew throughout the story line with a breath taking crescendo in the final scene.

i saw this movie when it aired on lifetime back in 2004. i have never seen it since then, but have thought of it often. it left such an impression on me i've been searching for it lately. i found it finally and realized it was made just for television. the movie is fabulous- filled with great writing and acting. william petersen is perfect, as always. this movie left me speechless and in tears. it's a wonderful story of faith, love, and compassion. does anybody know how i can obtain a copy of this movie for my home? is that possible with television movies?? i really would love to see it again. this is a must-have among my collection!!

i have not seen it since 1998 and yet i still can't get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so that shows what an impression it made.just a wonderful story.i just hope to see the stair at least once in person...i didn't know much about mr. petersen before this movie as i hadn't seen any of his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and i think his portrayal of grissom on csi just shows more of the same. he knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through which makes him just that much better of an actor.i can't remember enough about the "poor accents" to comment but i must say i have always enjoyed barbara hershey in all of her roles as well and i thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie.

almost no information is available about this movie, or its air dates. after an ongoing and exhaustive search i found the dvd to be available for 3.99!-release date february 28, 2006. try yahoo/dvd and video. in order to get this information posted i will continue to state that this is a well made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. it is a chance to see william l. peterson before c.s.i. turned him into a star. equally featured in the story is the venerable barbara hershey - does anyone remember when she was barbara hershey seagull? i have to keep writing to get this posted. thank you to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure tv film which obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.

and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven irish accent of barbara hershey in the leading role of mother madalyn. the accent came and went unfortunately which i found more than a little distracting. however, the performance of william l petersen in the role of joad was outstanding, he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue. captivating and genuine, i found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the character. the premise of the film is fairly simple, the building of a forgotten staircase in a church. it is based, rather loosely i believe, on a true story and i had heard of this staircase prior to seeing the movie. it was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time - a floating double helix made without nails or screws. it exists to this day although it is now in private ownership.**minor spoiler**good supporting cast and barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn't disappoint. lots of special moments.7/10

i am from texas and my family vacationed a couple of years ago to sante fe with my brother. he suggested we go to see the church with the staircase. i was absolutely blown away by the miracles that took place there. the movie is great - barbara hershey and william petersen were perfect for the parts they played. it is amazing, absolutely amazing. if you have not seen the staircase in person, it is worth the trip to go see it. the wood is beautiful and the architecture is astounding. just being in the chapel gives me goose bumps! to read about the history of the chapel, and then to see its beauty is breathtaking. see the movie - it is great! then see the staircase in person!

to those of you who've made comments on this film earlier and hoped to see it again, i hope you did. it was broadcast today (nov. 28th,'04) on lifetime movie network. i subscribe to dish.karen arthur directed william petersen and barbara hershey in this southwestern gothic-like tale, expertly. the lighting, editing and dialog contributed greatly to the film and hershey and peterson were perfectly cast for the roles, both playing sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. the screen play was excellent, as well the supporting cast.not having known ahead-of-time, i guessed correctly the story was based on truth, and now that i know it i must make the sojourn, as santa fe is a hop, skip and a jump from tucson.as an engineer, i was fascinated with the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it (who was he? an angel?). but the storyline, and it's several plots, of how it came to be is what most captivates you. you certainly get a strong sense that god in his heaven was in every detail of this entire drama in history. for you who have seen the film, you know what i'm talking about. for those of you who haven't, i won't spoil a minute of it...bon holiday,bob shank jr, raytheon missile systems, tucson, az

seriously any film with john malkovich is usually very good. and this includes clint eastwood, rene russo, john mahoney (frasier), dylan mcdermott (the practice), and many more great actors.clint is getting old now but thanks he is also an awesome director (in his own right).we are used to wolfgang "water films" like das boot, poseidon and perfect storm - this was really different but just as sublimely directed.the premise of the assassin is as serious as it comes, the film is well paced, some of the violence is a bit... but altogether recommended (but not for kids).

wolfgang petersen (das boot, air force one) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor, john malkovich. his criminal attempting to assassinate the president was first-rate and credible.that is not to diminish the efforts of clint eastwood and rene russo, or even fred dalton thompson, who plays a real jerk of a white house chief of staff. eastwood was great, and i love any film that russo is in.the movie feature original music by five time oscar winner (mal√®na, bugsy, the untouchables, the mission, days of heaven) ennio morricone. that alone makes it worth your time.

wolfgang peterson directs this thriller that has clint eastwood playing secrect service agent frank horrigan, who matches wits with a clever psycho(john malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game involving the the protection of the president. mitch leary(malkovich)keeps in touch with horrigan teasing the agent with discouraging remarks about his abilities, as well as the secret service's protection of the presidents in the past. agent lilly raines(rene russo)tries to keep horrigan grounded; but he is head strong in stopping leary from carrying out his threats of assassination. very good fx and fast pace sustains the plot. eastwood and malkovich are superb. russo has a way of getting your attention. rounding out this strong cast are: dylan mcdermott, fred dalton thompson, john mahoney and gary cole.

what i've seen of wolfgang petersen's films has been pretty good. he knows how to direct action, create suspense and get you interested. eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. this goes for both his acting and his directing. they both hand in solid work here. the concept isn't bad, and the cat-and-mouse game works well. malkovich performs rather well, and his and eastwood's playing off each other adds to the film. i suppose this won't introduce anything new, really... but it never really claims to, nor needs to. it's two great actors, each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well, and with a magnificent director at the helm. really, it's entertaining, well-done, and it just plain delivers. editing and cinematography are good. acting and character writing is, as well. the film manages to be suspenseful and intense, and if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are superior films out there. the pacing is pretty much spot-on. i recommend this to any fan of the principal actors, the director and/or this type of film. 7/10

this is one of the few movies of this type i have reviewed, and enjoyed. while clint eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well, even in the limits of washington d.c.the theme: an assassin is tracking the president, and there is only one person who may save him.it cannot be easy to make a film which audiences enjoy these days, involving this arena. this film succeeds on several levels. eastwood is his usual underplayed hero, wanting to save the president since the kennedy era. he does well in this role, as does his foil, reneee russo ( an fbi agent) overall well-done and suspenseful with extra stars for malkovich. 9/10.

this is a hollywood film. the credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. this film will not change the world. however, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.it's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-cia assassin who feels betrayed chasing a secret service agent who was protecting john f. kennedy when kennedy was killed in dallas. the agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary america, this would-be assassin mitch leary (john malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the president. he imagines he has common cause with secret service agent frank horrigan (clint eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the warren commission, blamed horrigan-unfairly, leary believes-for the assassination of president kennedy. the tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from leary to horrigan-leary wanting to keep horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.rene russo is excellent as lily raines a fellow agent with whom horrigan develops a grown- up relationship. it is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if russo is a fair deal younger than eastwood at the time of filming). russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted horrigan in friendly banter. it is a nice part for russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. the acting by the leads, wolfgang peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film i can watch over and over.

this is s superbly crafted top-notch washington thriller directed by the talented wolfgang petersen with hotshot screenwriter jeff maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so maybe he tends his roses). the film has clint eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and john malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity, where the president's life is at stake. unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the president, which is an authentic touch. this film was made when both eastwood and malkovich were at their peak. probably eastwood has never done a better job than he does here, and it is all so effortless for the old pro. there are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the president's car as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. i wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added. my 'guardian angel', whose name is vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than i did, but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing. rene russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for eastwood, as she is so unobvious but so talented, and she shines. the tension is taut every inch of the way in this story, and the psychological struggles of eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting. with eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter, watch out! of course, he is the master of the super-cool. malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays, and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection. what a good 'un.

anne (natalie portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, adele (susane sarandon). that's how the movie begins. adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. it's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role. she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw, and so is sarandon. they really look like mother daughter. the soundtrack is also great. the movie is incredible. *10 out of 10*

i was able to see "anywhere but here" last night as a free sneak preview. i absolutely loved the film! i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother/daughter relationship...there was definitely a connection between adele a and ann. i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman. sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role. portman was also excellent as ann. she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i don't think any other teenage actress could. i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both sarandon and portman for awards in the "actress" and "supporting actress" categories. it would be a shame if they were overlooked.

my one-line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true. i did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much.adele, who is solidly portrayed by susan sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. she is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. adele's daughter, anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old. this, of course, makes natalie portman the perfect choice to play anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either. portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years. yet, even with the two solid leads, wayne wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with the joy luck luck and even more so with smoke. though i have not read the book, the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen, changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story. i enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work, but i never got lost in the experience and i never related to their plight.

natile portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. as the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl, sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer. more importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over portman's portrayal of the daughter. the question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot, who changes? this film is certainly about the daughter, but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter. i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also. the hallmark of fine drama

being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom. of course, my situation doesn't parrallel with natalie portman and surandon's situation; but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights. there is always the mother telling you what to do, or not being the kind of mother you want to be. i was balling my eyes at the end of this movie. surandon's reaction of her daughter going to the east coast, miles away, after all they've been through reminded me of how i felt, being from a small city in the west coast, going to new york. the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up. it is very touching, i was moved by the movie. every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real, you didn't get any phony sentimentality. i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie, alone, wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything. this movie is a bit corny of course, but everything is trully momentous. its all about what a mom can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother. 8/10

the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting, and i was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. it is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. i couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. the acting was quite exquisite and i hope we'll be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road...

well, i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film. natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film. beautiful film.

it was a very well written movie, and the actors had a very exquisite way of portraying all the character. but as the movie came to an end i felt as if there was more but they forgot to put it on the dvd. maybe they are planning on making a sequel...well even if they don't it's a good movie and a good rental, but even a better purchase.

this movie just felt very true to life. i liked the ending which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments but with a lot of little moments coming together. you could tell it is an honest love story. it doesn't matter what the 'sexual orientation' of the main characters are, it still a story about love and understanding.there were a lot of scenes that involved the family. the setting is during what for some people is a very stressful time. namely "the holidays." christmas to be precise. like most good films, this one addresses issues of love, fitting in, expectations, and can't-be-overcome biases. in the end alexandra and casey make a choice for each other, knowing that love is difficult, and about giving. well done.

this film was a new direction for natalie portman. a much more adult role, though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself. ann,(portman) and susan sarandon, who plays her newly divorced mother, adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills. there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman's character grows up. unknowingly at first to adele, she grows up and becomes a better mother for it.ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress, or so she thinks. adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives. we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone, having left their old lives behind.the acting is top notch from both of them. they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes. you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie.though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films, the fact that the acting is well done, and the story isn't too flawed, let's me recommend it.i will say however, it will probably go away soon, i don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so. see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses.

treading water is a very beautiful movie. i would put it straight under the wonderful short movie : cosa bella from fiona mackenzie. it's not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general. i am looking forward to seeing more of laurel himmel's work in the future. the actors, angie redman and nina landey are quite good. the main characters relationship could have been strenghtened a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit. i am surprised that angie redman doesn't appear much in other movies. a great first step as a director for laurel himmel, i am sure there's more to see from her skills.

susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august, a single mother who's the working definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from wisconsin to california.decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. it pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. best thing it offers is a solid cast, and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.could be better, could be worse.i gave this one seven out of ten.

wayne wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than "slums of beverly hills", which covers remarkably similar ground. the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting. real chemistry there. this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. susan sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic. and, natalie portman deflects each attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child, untainted by the smug cynicism of the natasha lyonne character in "slums of beverly hills". portman's character is an adolescent with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern films. the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard. i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.

i must admit, at first i was worried about farscape. the opening segment was not very strong, and i began to worry about what was to come. however, once it set in to familiar henson territory with the wry sense of humor, the unique and enduring characters, and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. the story follows john crichton (played by ben browder) a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion. however, during the first test, his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field, and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy, where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners (on the starship moya) and the peacekeepers (human enforcers). he is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship, and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners (ka d'argo, a luxom warrior; pa'u zhaan, a delvian priestess; rygel xvi, a deposed ruler; and aeryn sun, a peacekeeper who has reluctantly joined the crew). with excellent special effects, moderate make-up, and puppets and robots that exceed the henson standard of perfection; as well as a very well written story, and character driven plot, farscape looks to be a fantastically original, creative, and clever science fiction series.

i'll admit that the first time i managed to catch sci-fi's "sci-fi prime" was last week, but despite the fact that i was a huge sliders fan coming into the experience, farscape is now easily my favorite of the four shows.unlike most modern sci-fi shows (including, regrettably, the two new star trek series), this show manages to be fun without coming across as fodder for mst3k.

having watched the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get a feel for the show, i think it shows potential. whilst much is borrowed from other shows (what sci-fi doesn't these days), and the characters are stereotyped, i like what they are doing with the stories. there is some continuity with plot development and character interaction/relationship building, despite the essentially modular nature of each episode. there have been some science related topics explored as well as character secret/weakness revelations. these have also added some comedy to the show, something i would gladly see more of in "serious" sci-fi. in all, this makes for good balance, such that can appeal to larger groups of people, unlike the star trek vs babylon 5 debates i've been numerous participant and witness to. the visual aspects of the show are more than adequate, and well budgeted for a first season. the acting is acceptable, and i am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes. i see enough positives and potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go...

not since j. michael straczynski's babylon 5, has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show. this is easily the best thing on tv right now! the characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well-being. the villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they're up to next. and brian hensen's puppet work is the most innovative out there. kudos to rockne s. o'bannon for a job well done!

after 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, i finally registered with imdb just so i could give farscape a "10." the show's writers, cast and crew have proven themselves the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre. even those who do not normally appreciate sci-fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance!farscape's virtues are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all; the quality of the writing is amazing. i haven't heard dialogue this good since "blake's 7." in fact, farscape feels a lot like a "blake's 7" with good special effects and a bit more romance.everyone, enjoy!

i remember ignoring the tv series when it first debuted because of its 'look' with the jim hensen muppets. however, recently a friend let me borrow his farscape dvds, and i am just now realizing what a terrible mistake that was. as with any tv series, there are episodes that shine and those that don't. i ride the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones. however, i endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together. what i'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. let me warn you, it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. i cannot recall any other tv series (babylon 5, buffy, angel, etc) that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking (at times) and suspenseful ride.i think that at the end of the fourth season, things were finally becoming tightly focused and i am shocked at the decision to cancel the series. i wait anxiously for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.

i happen to love this show. its a refreshing take on some older sci-fi feels and styles. they aren't afraid to shoot, and when they do people tend to die. far too many show's are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff. farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters. they all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their box's to make the mini-series. from beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope, and dispair, as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, surprising you every time. worth a watch even if you don't have the time.

i think that farscape is the best scifi since babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi television series of all time (ranking up there with dr. who, blake's 7, red dwarf, mst3k and the aforementioned b5). i find the characters and races of farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical "humans-with-birthmarks" that are found in many series. the effects are quite good and the stories engaging. despite missing the bulk of season 2 and some of season 1, i find the character development very well done.

i heard about this series in 2001 which a friend of mine was recording off the television each week. i never bothered to watch though i became acquainted with the series through the magazine which i looked at every now and then in bookstores. i recently purchased series one on dvd and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series. the characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force. as they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them (bearing in mind that this is only a tv series and they are fictional).however it isn't the pc world of star trek and so whilst every character shows a good trait they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with. indivual story lines mixed in with an overall multiple story-arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences i have ever had the pleasure of viewing. i absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another.this strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut john crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures, being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades we can easily relate to what he must be feeling. as he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate, strong-willed and brave character is a joy to watch.i have watched only seven episodes of farscape season one and look forward to continuing through seasons two-four and the mini-series. maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch. buy and enjoy! 10/10.

well how can i categorise farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives? ok, here goes! the scripts are fantastic, with each episode offering so much entertainment, drama, humour and sheer watchability. the casting is perfect especially that of zhaan (the blue lady) played by virginia hey, each character has a depth that just isn't there on the star trek series.i think having an australian spin on the show makes this for me, australia has been knocking out quality films for years and farscape is no exception.i have only seen the first four episodes in uk order and they have a quality that makes each 45 minute show (in the uk) stand out more like a film than a weekly tv series.the episode that really does it for me is 'i, et' which turns the alien concept around where moya (a living ship, even the spacecraft has a great character) is forced to land on a planet that has yet to make 'first contact' and is surprisingly earth like and crichton meets a radio telescope operator and *he* is the 'little green man' to them. gripping stuff.in short the effects are great, the scripts are top quality and the main characters (not one of them really given any more importance than any other) are interesting, not always 'good' and well just excellent.roll on the second season!

a must see documentary.-----this movie had so many things to consider while watching it. it was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named brenton butler. he accused of killing a white tourist in florida. it shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. the husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. the police little to investigate the crime. brenton's lawyer patrick mcguinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client. he tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess. the camera goes with mcguinness to where brenton was questioned. mcguinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored. he questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words. mcguinness investigates with ann finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not. the movie shows the butlers as a loving christian family who have faith in their son's innocence and faith that god will set brenton free. they visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him. there are scenes of group prayer for brenton, the lawyers, the judge and everyone involved in this case. i am a white and i was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks. it was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man. police have a hard job and i believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie. i think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system including judges, police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it.

this is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around. the production values are in a class of their own. the characters are rounded and interesting. this is entertainment at its best. some of the aliens are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying humour which makes it unmissable. i hope that this series goes on for many years and will have many spin-offs. science fiction has had its bad press, some justified, but this is truly a flagship science fiction series and i thank henson for it. top marks.

somehow, i missed many of the early farscape episodes, so i'm seeing them in all sorts of orders as they are repeated on various channels. i first caught it - entirely by accident - whilst lounging in a hotel room. the first 10 seconds had me completely hooked - this is what sf is all about.the characters are strong; and moya/pilot the living ship is what lexx should have been. the plots vary in quality, but none falls below excellent in my opinion. and i have to mention rygel - what a gloriously irreverent character! none of your smarmy sugar-coated star trek aliens here, this is the real deal - cynical, self-serving and replete with disgusting personal habits, rygel is the creation of a genius.last week the scifi channel showed "out of their minds" (the body-swapping episode). a true classic, i couldn't stop laughing from start to finish...long may farscape grace our screens!

not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape does...i know youngsters and 30/40+ years old;fans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this t.v miniseries. it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on t.v, character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera; yet in the same episode it has science fact & fiction that would give even the hardiest "trekkie" a run for his money in the brainbender stakes! wormhole theory, time travel in true equational form...magnificent. it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from.with such a broad scope; it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long, but here is where "farscape" really comes into it's own element...it succeeds where all others have failed, especially the likes of star trek (a universe with practically zero kaos element!) they ran out of ideas pretty quickly + kept rehashing them! over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole. this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues. i happened to see the pilot (premiere) in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever "get the girl", after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd & i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia...farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights...do yourself a favour; watch the pilot and see what i mean...farscape comet

i too remember seeing this film as a youngster at a local small theater that presented foreign films each week. it was the daring adventure of it all that stayed in my memory ever since.especially impressionable was the scene with noel purcell as the old seaman, paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard apparitions and died of fright in a cave. i always kept track of noel's career even decades later due to my seeing him then. there's also a youngish cyril cusack as the leering boatman, james, with designs on the lovely jean simmons, shown as emmeline grown up.would very much like to own a video of this haunting film and refresh my memory of it. where do i send my request?

i saw this movie as a child and i am longing to see it again. has it survived? i discount the 1980 version entirely as being fluff. i am sure that there are many that don't feel it is necessary to preserve these films. it is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it is gone. young people today don't realize the hallucinatory quality and the impact on one's life a film seen in early youth can have in later life. this film, "the blue lagoon" had that effect on me. how many of us have wished to find ourselves in a place removed of the fears and chaos of the modern world. this was an idyllic story of a boy and girl castaway on a tropical island. there are troubles to be sure but in the end they fall in love and the have a baby. life should be so simple and beautiful.

i saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago, and i haven't forgotten it to this day. i couldn't say whether it's a good picture. but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons. the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie, but i still remember the plot. simmons was very young then, and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: david lean's great expectations. and again it was the young jean simmons. it's a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video; i'd like to correct my memories...

this movie appears to have been overlooked by everyone. someone should bring it out on vhs and dvd. it is an excellent film and far superior to the one with brooke shields, which was terrible. jean simmons deserves more credit than she is getting now days. it would be nice if all her films were offered on vhs or dvd. jean simmons was, and still is, a very good actress. she certainly was a beauty. in fact, she is still a beauty. she also has done extremely well on t.v. she is so much better than many of the actors today.

for the record, the 1949 version of "the blue lagoon" is not the original film, as many have stated.this story was filmed in great britain, in 1923, just after the novel was written. as much as i'd love to see the 1949 version, i'd thoroughly enjoy an opportunity at seeing the true original release of this story on film.granted, the 1980 film with christopher atkins, brooke shields, and the two youngsters was filmed with beautiful cinematography. the acting didn't seem all that great when i first viewed this film, but after having viewed this a few times.... it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without adult guidance, would indeed have a simplistic way of approaching life.... whether it be in their language, appearance, or daily activities.although some have been fortunate enough to view the 1949 "blue lagoon", i cannot help but wonder if there is anyone living who can remember the 1923 release of this story to film.

this may not be regarded as a review on any film, but just a comment on a film i saw when i was a youngster. i remember coming home of an evening all full of wonder at what i had seen. i tried to retell my parents part of the story but they listened without understanding well what was so strange about two kids stranded on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a son. as you must have guessed by now i'm referring to the blue lagoon (1949) which has kept me bewitched and bewildered through the years (almost 50) and now wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in cassette or dvd or whatever. i've spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it. what a waste indeed! sorry if my english is not at all technical or scientific, but my mother tongue is spanish. i'm doing my best to make myself understood. thank you, my name is juan and i'm writing from uruguay in s.america.

i think crewes did her evil part very well she should have won an award. anything that dunne is in. is salvageable because dunne is a great actress and can pull anything off, even a weak script. therefore i would recommend it for this reason alone. this movie may have been a little ahead of it's time, the plot might be more acceptable these days.during the golden age of hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach, mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times. this plot seem to deviate from that profile. yet, again i must say what ever irene dunne was in, at least, was "good" because she made things so believable! the only other actress i can say made me think this way was maybe, deborah kerr. watch silver cord if you get the chance for the "acting" if nothing else.

i saw this movie last night on hbo & didn't expect to get hooked - i usually fall asleep when i watch hbo. but it happened & you will too. it's a tragic documentary (2002 oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in jacksonville, florida and subsequent investigation, arrest, & trial of a 15 year old boy.watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. this film was most deserving of an esteemed oscar - you'll be moved to tears.

who won the best actress oscar for 1933? it should have been laura hope crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. she truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. she played the frivolous prudence duvernoy in "camille" (1936) and her best remembered role is aunt pittypat in "gone with the wind".irene dunne was the "official" star of the film but her scenes with laura hope crewes were dynamite.david (joel mccrea) is in heidelberg when he is offered a job in new york. his wife, christine (irene dunne) can continue her studies at the rockafellar centre. their first stop in america is a visit to david's mother, mrs. phelps. to say that laura hope crewes dominates every scene is an under-statement. from her first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet her "big boy" - all attention is on her. even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets hester's existence, even forgetting how she takes her tea, you know something is not quite right.(hester has been living there for a while.)frances dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable hester. her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under-rated as an actress she was.all the young cast are excellent. eric linden is superb as robert, the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell. joel mccrea, at one point says "painting roses on bathtubs - that's more your style". there is a very subtle suggestion in the film of robert's sexuality.irene dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.

this story of the troubles caused by an over-possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (laura hope crews) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by irene dunn (the new daughter-in-law), joel mccrea (the number-one son), eric linden (the number-two son) and frances dee (fiance of number-two son). here's the show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their owns lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy. irene dunn is stellar in her role. joel mccrea's performance is open and clear and laura hope crews is masterful as the mother.yet this reviewer finds frances dee's performance the best of all. hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings. her portrayal in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face ! frances dee, like laura hope crews, has been too long overlooked, and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. no actress who started in film after wwii has had anything to speak of on frances dee.if you're lucky enough to see the silver cord, which was never released for tv, you'll find this "old fashioned drawing-room drama" to be an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances.

i really felt the movie was ahead of its time. the one potential daughter-in-law was such a strong, career oriented woman. she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the over-bearing mother-in-law to be. the mother's role was played extremely well (you just loved to hate her). her need to control her son's lives was neurotically evil. if you've ever been in a relationship where you've been judged and found lacking (and everybody involved knew it) this may hit too close to home. it's been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50's or 60's movie. it is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons' dynamic but i would love to watch it again. i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck. attempts to buy it were also futile (i don't believe it's on tape or dvd).

terrific acting by the 5 stars makes this one a must see.based on a stage play, the silver cord is about "mother love" at its worst. the film was very controversial for its implied homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural "romantic" feelings for both sons.irene dunne stars as the new bride (and biologist) who travels with husband (joel mccrea) to visit the family before heading off to new york city for their new jobs. but something seems wrong.the mother, laura hope crews, seems rude to the younger son's (eric linden) fianc√©e (frances dee). but dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores a few of the strange things the mother says. then she finds out "her" room is down the hall from mccrea's, and his room adjoins mother's room.later she walks in as "mummy" is tucking in mccrea and kissing him (on the lips) good night. mummy has also been working on linden and getting him to doubt his feelings for dee. everything blows up and with dee running into the snowy night toward the frozen pond. as the boys run after her, mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their coats! dee falls through the ice and is rescued.as the girls leave the house the following morning, dunne lets mummy know what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. but mummy has a tight hold, faking illness and forever boasting of her sacrifices. the girls leave but the boys stay behind.......crews is magnificent as the voracious mother (repeating her stage role); it's a part few actresses would dare play. the sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 film and crews take advantage of her best film role. dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing mccrea. dee has some excellent scenes after she gets dumped by bewildered linden. all 5 stars are terrific in this drama that is bizarrely underrated and unknown.a neglected gem for anyone who likes great acting......

yikes! and we all thought joan crawford was the horror mommy dearest...well laura hope crewes as mom in this stinging 4 character film delivers (and cops) the goods in this cracker of a marital mommy mangle.....the silver cord is a genuinely sensational pre code drama from rko made in 1932 released in '33 from a 1929 play. so astonishing, frank and honest is each startling verbal exchange between one son's wife (irenedunne) along with the other's fianc√© as these two younger girls together go to war - gleefully angrily unwrapping the clearly incestuous hankerings of mom towards her hunky eldest son played by virile joel maccrea and her younger 'beau'/son payed by delicate and beautiful 25 year old actor eric linden. i would think this film played to many howling appreciative audiences in huge theaters in 1933 and offers viewers even in 2005 a very fruity melodrama enlivened by crackling dialog not afraid to call mother exactly as she is. this film would have been impossible to make after the censorship code came in after 1934. other viewer comments on the imdb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see (and tape) the silver cord will agree it is an unforgettable and pungent script in a superbly produced film. it would have played like the virginia wolf of 1932. laura hope crewes must have kissed the sound stage at rko for this role of a lifetime..even more than her fluffy turn in gwtw. irene dunne is as gorgeous and casual and believable as ever, fighting for her husband yet again, and it is well worth seeing the divorc√©e made in 1929 as a companion piece to the silver cord. joel macrea is certainly in the same league as cary grant and randolph scott in the handsome and lovable stakes. i had never seen eric linden in a real acting role before (he played the leg amputee in the hospital horror scene in gwtw) and here he is startling and youthful with an excellent role as robert, the younger and more sensitive son. some verbal barbs leveled at him again would not get past the code office if made later. this is a really good film, and if the viewer forgives some of the creakiness of its time and settles in for a sparring match of unequaled pungency for a 1932 movie, you will be well rewarded. at first i thought some of the throat clutching melodrama of mother was dated until i realized it was a set up of the excellent screenplay to make the viewer laugh at her as though she is a weak little old lady......not..... but nor are the other two women in this powerhouse play on film, hence the fantastic retort dialog. that ocean-liner seen in reel one is the leviathan the monster ship the us won from the germans in ww1 that was so huge and unwieldy that crews were nervous wrecks trying to wrestle with it upon the atlantic. it is infamous for ploughing headfirst up a colossal wave in a storm and shot over the crest at such an angle the spine along the bottom cracked and the ship split vertically between the funnels. it limped to port with rattling steel panels and winking rivet holes...and mentally shattered crew and passengers. it was scuttled in 1935 after being cursed and plagued with horror mechanical problems all its existence. not such a war prize after all. anyway, the dialog in the silver cord is enough excitement for one night: eg: "mother! the doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, in fact he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you". whammo!

this is an extraordinary film. as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening. for brenton butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. in truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, or a guilty man being free. every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim. but do they get it? the film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen.

art imitates life imitates art. atticus finch is reincarnated into the d.a. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity, and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. the music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.

anyone that is looking for an episode of "law and order" or "csi" would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.a murder took place, and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? sure, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently. he must have shrunk, reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothes.the police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! the did no forensics on any of the evidence, they questioned no other witnesses, and they beat a confession out of a 15-year-old.the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville, florida. let everyone now start talking about "southern justice."

very good film. very good documentary.very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swines their one eyed parents, community and environment raised them as.i tip my lid to pat mcguinness. can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? we need his integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.all the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. pat mcguinness should be the first drops of that real rain. the people who control this earth are animals. they need to be drowned.i'm just in shock. walking the night is scary business. the inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives, in murder on a sunday morning. in pat mcguinness' blazing spotlight, they look horribly caught, horribly guilty, and ready for a just and horrible drowning.it is exceptionally satisfying, in a world in which the punters play a rigged game, to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are.how does it feel you railroading, abominable, snaky fingers of the law? how does it feel to have your rigged prosecution, your rigged confession, your rigged detective work found out for what it really was? how does it feel? i hope it twists like a knife you miserable, one eyed nothings.

you think the police are always right.you believe that "eye-witnesses" are always right.you believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation.you believe a u.s. city might have a "few bad apples" in law enforcement, but that the "good cops" will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evil's sake in the bud.you believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff, and being allowed to beat "confessions" out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the america of the 1930s, but not today.you believe a judge will not send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot, and they did not feel like working that day.you believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are "exceptions to the rule," and an injustice like this could never involve your family member, someone in the middle class, or someone like you.you think that you are aware of every terrible, indisputable, 100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in america--yet you haven't seen this film.

fires on the plain directed by kon ichikawa and written by shohei ooka and natto wada is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers, but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the philippines. the main characters name is tamura , played by eiji funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. all he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. like this, he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease. but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. throughout the whole movie, tamura remains a bit cowardish, but very civil, when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade. a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is, when tamura comes into a phillipino village which is completely deserted. there, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. this makes tamura think and even more scared than he already is. that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly. after he turns away from the corpses, two phillipinos (a couple or brother and sister : very close relationship) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back. the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first, although he walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman once she starts screaming. her brother/boyfriend/husband then runs away in fear and after a moment tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing filipino. he does not hit him. after tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very precious , he drops his gun into a river. this gesture is very important in order to understand kon ichikawa's/shohei ooka's profiling of tamura and the war. comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies, it is not typical at all. of course all movies have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than tamura. he expresses everything that is human: he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope. this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society. since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society, japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim. this victimisation is also very visual in this movie. one of the examples is tamura, another one the piled up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is, when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike. in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. it also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in. once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent.

the title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest, like rice husks, by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains. this is a bleak tale of the destruction of the japanese soldier.the story is set in the closing days of the philippines campaign as a soldier with tb who returns from a hospital because since he can walk, they have no room for him. his superior officers don't want him around since he's really too sick to work or fight. abused by his officer he's sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself. they still won't take him and he's soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's inhumanity to man at every turn.billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie. this isn't to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. how could it not be? here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant, people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you can't help but laugh. to be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy.hailed as a great anti-war film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty. here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still are, quite beautiful. its a jarring sensation.what intriguing is that i read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of christianity. the director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that there is, ultimately no hope.intellectually i admire the film, emotionally i don't. part of it is a strident downbeat score which, for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn't really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another.is it a great film, thats for you to decide. for certain its unlike any other war film, bloody, horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are. this is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades.definitely worth a look.

i got this movie out a week after the death of ichikawa kon - i suppose if there is one way to mark the passing of a great director, its to raise a glass of wine to him while watching one of his greatest movies. ichikawa had one of the finest careers in japanese film, but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near contemporaries such as ozu and kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not by much). he is one of those directors who defies auteur theories - its likely that his wife (who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies) was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was. but at his best, he was as good as any japanese film maker at the time. in particular, he had great technical skills, allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. but in terms of theme, this movie could hardly be simpler - war is hell. no really, its seriously hell.fire on the plain doesn't follow the normal war genre rules. there is no real beginning - we start as the wretched tamura, who is a regular private (although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others - at one stage it is shown he understands english, but he clams up when the others ask him how he knows it) is ordered to hospital, as his unit is already in an appalling state. the soldiers are defeated and starving to death. they are no longer an army, just a rag bag group of refugees - hunted by the locals, and pretty much ignored by the americans, who have bigger fish to fry. hunger and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness.in typical ichikawa style, its not all just grim - its oddly funny in parts (a very black humour of course).the high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography. the characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are all too believable. this is that rare film - one which will refuse to erase itself from your head, even if you want to forget it.

i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier. it compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.the story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the jacksonville, fl, murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.about half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses, and visiting key locations. this is edited with a minimum of needless repetition, and placed in logical order. the camera work is pretty solid. and there's a mildly surprising epilogue.

with that, carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess: lying, deception, laziness, the list goes on.however, as an american, i was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force as is reflected with the duval county sheriff department's horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth. i shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man's life hung in the crooked balance of justice.however, there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly-paid public defenders stuck by their guns (irony intended) and forced the truth from the detectives. i wanted to fly down to florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in duval county; those lawyers care about the "little" man and, most importantly, for justice.the other story line is about faith and family. praises to the accused's family and their strong christian (submit any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values. i hope they win their lawsuit against the duval county sheriff's department.bravo for justice!!! bravo for the little guy!!!

i watched this movie with my mother. she is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. she even acknowledges this. i don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. scary. i felt for this child and his family. what torture they went through and remained faithful. that is true faith. back to the movie. i was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. i am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. i could tell when one the cops was lying. he would not look the defender in the eyes. his eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. it is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin. i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. they were finally found guilty after many years. i can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. whites doing whatever they want with blacks. i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. no comment from her. i want to commend the director and producer of this film. i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. i am an avid viewer of indy films. i feel that they are well written and have substance. i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf. i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society.

i just saw the movie, through netflix. i was intrigued by the way the movie was described, but in the end, it was better. i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie. i was filled with hurt, hate, angry, bitterness,pain and finally relief. to look at the young man accused, would break your heart, and convince you that they had the wrong person. the smugness of the police, makes you cring, because just as the rodney king beating brought to light, the brutality of the police, this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police. and the fact that they beat this boy, and got away with it, only infuriates you more.but, i have to tell you, i fell in love with the attorney, mc guinness. one of my favorite lines, when he was telling us what an a**hole on of the cops was... the cop told him, to go on, keep sucking on that cancer stick. mc guinness told the cop... 'i always have a cigarette before sex...' i was letting him know i was going to screw him"i have a new respect for some of the law in this country.

i've never seen a show with as much story, mystery, suspense, and hard-hitting excitement before. i barley watch tv anymore but i own every season of this show and it's amazing. every episode is extremely well-acted, written and plotted. towards the end of the show i felt that the stories were getting too far-fetched for being in a prison, but the actors pulled it off. sopranoes sucks huge compared to oz. in fact, any show that is on a cable network, hbo or not just cant hold a candle to oz. i wish it would come back for one more season. if it did happen, they would probably kill off every character on the show, but hey, we all gotta go sometime. as far as the characters, i'd say o'reily and alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories i thought were the strongest of anyones, except beechers of course, but still... anyway, best show ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, period!

the brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process, which is a conventional, but executed, intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post wwii, but in the fact that this story was told at all. samuel goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands, an alcoholic, and an underachiever.

what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them, bugs them,haunts them. billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition. he paints the good and the bad in all of us. he also paints with love. i can't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it. they will last because they are true. i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed. now i'm an old man and i still feel the tears welling but don't leave the room. i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. billy preserved them in this film and not in a 'greatest generation' way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.

this film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. a triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as "the deer hunter.") i like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.the tale is a simple one. three very different servicemen who have mustered out after world war ii (the big one!) fly home to their midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. one has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.there are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. fredric march won the best actor oscar for playing an old sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. personally, i think jimmy stewart deserved it for "it's a wonderful life," which also deserved the best picture award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. as i said, it was fashionable. march has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real wwii hero pappy boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.i am going against the grain here, but i thought that myrna loy, who played march's wife, was justly ignored by the academy. i detected barely a hint of warmth from her. in fact, i kept thinking she was going to slap frederic march for annoying her. she practically grimaced every time they were together. something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. i think all this nonsense about her being "the perfect wife" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. you may disagree with that, but the academy voters apparently did not. she is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.dana andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. he is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. but then he chances upon march's daughter peggy (teresa wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, "i'm going to bust that marriage up!" the romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.speaking of uplifting, now we come to harold russell. he has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. his best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. "i'm lucky, i still have my elbows unlike some of the boys." truly great stuff.the film has some moments that soar. it also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.

since there have been so many reviews of this fine film i will write in a list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussed.1. dana andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie. his character according to the screenplay was in his mid 20s. andrews, a highly underrated actor, did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger. 2. fredric march like all great actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over-the-top acting. he was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror. 3. dana andrews was superb as he was in "laura," "the ox-bowl incident," "a walk in the sun," "the purple heart" and many other films. why did fredric march win the academy award and why was dana andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance? 4. harold russell gave the best performance i have ever seen by a non actor. 5. i realize this was the 1940s but dana andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (virginia mayo).6. ray teal, who played the right wing bigot, years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on "bonanza."7. the professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving, boring and poorly acted. the professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films. the beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity, excessive violence and gratuitous sex.***i was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful.

this superb 40's post war classic, tends to be overlooked thesedays. when it was released in 1945, it cleaned up at the 1946oscars, mostly at the expense of `it's a wonderful life.' both films were up for best film , bestdirector, and best actor, all won by ¬ëbest years'. frederic march ,and dana andrews along with an amateur actor harold russell ( areal life soldier,who lost both hands in an explosion,) play thereturning soldiers, finding life is very different , from what theyremember. myrna loy is superb as march's wife, who has to keepthe family together while he has been away.the tear jerking scene where march and loy are reunited is magnificent. all threemen find that they have problems readjusting to post war life, notleast russell coming to terms with artificial hands, and his finance(cathy o'donnell ) trying to be too helpful. sam goldywn is quoted that he doesn't care if the film makes nomoney at all, as long as everyone in america sees the film ,so theywill appreciate what these men went through. if any film is worth 10 out of 10, it is this one.

while watching a mundane modern movie (the runaway bride) with my granddaughter (age 22) she asked me "since you've been watching movies since 1938, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?" boy! what a choice that is! it took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before i made my decision. it is "the best years of our lives". this movie has no flaws. it is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. there is not a single part in the film which could be left out. the young girl's fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. a women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years. the realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. the look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. a parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities. a man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure. this is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. this was real life! it could not have been portrayed any different. this, my friends, is how it was!! this could easily be considered a documentary. in this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest b/w filming, editing and directing you will ever see. the casting was perfect. if i could, i would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art.

i was blown away when i saw "the best years of our lives". the acting, script, and master william wyler's direction(winner of best director in 1946)is brilliant.the film is about three world war ii veteran's who come home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same town. they all are reunited with their families.the first man al stephenson(played by fredric march in his oscar winning role) has to adapt to his wife millie(played by myrna loy) and children peggy and rob(played by teresa wright and michael hall) being different than before he left for the war.the second man fred derry(played by dana andrews in an excellant role) has to find a good job and adapt to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war. he begins to find out that she is not the same.the third man has a much more harder adaptation to make. homer parish(played by harold russell in his excellant oscar role)he has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and fiance' wilma's(played by cathy o'donnell) reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands. all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scences. the stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together.this film truly defines the meaning of a "classic". this unforgettable drama(winner of best picture in 1946) is a film that everyone should see.if i was asked to pick a favorite film i would pick this one.out of 10 i would give "the best years of our lives" an 11.so the next time you rent a movie rent this one you won't regret it.

this is one of the great movies of all time. the story is fascinating and the actors are convincing. your really identify with the characters. william wyler proofs with this movie that he is a great director. his craftsmanship is unsurpassed.

so many great talents were utilized in "the best years of out lives", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. think of what its director, william wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles, he was making a film that argued that the us's leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had "wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under." there are beautiful sets by julia heron, gregg toland's cinematography and a script by robert e. sherwood, author of "the road to rome" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. the ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as frederic march, myrna loy, teresa wright, dana andrews, virginia mayo, cathy o'donnell and hoagy carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. the clever plot line was the experiences of thee "couples" after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a 'victory culture". their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that "all was well with "america"". march and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; o'donnell's young man, harold russell,, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all andrews' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, to consideration on his individual merits, to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing, and loss of everything he had ever had. the shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again,each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent an un-american united states. wyler's direction, especially of the scene where andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed b-17, alone and the scene of russell's wedding is wonderful indeed. this is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, one women and men can agree on for once. music by hugo friedhofer and costumes by irene sharaff add to its luster. one of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning b/w.

the movie features another exceptional collaboration between director william wyler and cinematographer gregg toland, the first after toland worked on citizen kane. but the talent of both these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted movie, understood in the good old american sense as a great story. the technical aspects of the movie are covered so as the viewer gets absorbed into the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. technique is seen as a vehicle of representation unlike in citizen kane where welles' baroque style almost drew the attention from the story to the way the story was told. one of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the returning home welcoming of homer and al. if homer's girl, wilma comes towards him perfectly in focus, al goes over to his wife also perfectly in focus. this is a brilliant move because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the movie: wilma loves homer and she accepts him as he is, al's wife loves him also but she feels unprepared to fully welcome him home. also later in the film we find out that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses.wyler is a director whose force lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to boast. he wanted to show his audience how hard it was for the american soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that either didn't understand them or treated them with contempt. with a perfect cast and great dialogue goldwin and wyler produced a movie that will forever be the template for any other returning home movie. the three hours which coincide with the "rough cut" because the test audience back then never felt for a moment that the action was slow and indeed every scene from the film seems perfectly justified. the whole thing is constructed beautifully, every character gets a fair amount of exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is quite pitiful that hollywood nowadays never manages to bring so much character conflict to the screen. tbyool explores the depth of the american way of life, of the american family and society to an extent that makes other movies look like "the children's hour".

with wwii over, movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home. "the best years of our lives" was probably the best example. it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre-war lives, but to the overall changing world. probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor harold russell. having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else; he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role. there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than "it's a wonderful life", but i certainly think that they did a good job with it. very well done.

as a "cusp-pre-baby-boomer"...born in 1944, in los angeles; thereby having the dubious distinction of having been alive while hitler was still actively involved in his "last great offensive; but also with our president roosevelt still actively fighting the offensive...this was one of the most important "first films" of my young life. having the opportunity to see it in "re-release," several years after the 1946 opening (a common studio custom in those years), answered (even to my very young mind)oh-so many questions i had...being surrounded by our returning vet heroes. ensconced in all the many of william wyler's equanimity of subtle "multi-plots"...intentionally not "surrounding," "mini" or "sub" plots...in all their "colors and shades of intensity"...did more, than anything else i can recall, to provide to me some semblance of "reason" and "rational explanation" of what had been going on all around me...in real life. (my personal experience perchance being a "new" and "different" angle when looking at this classic film.)

in a film as successful as this, it is difficult to single out any one factor. all departments work in perfect union to create on of the most moving human dramas ever put on film. the production is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of the writers, producer, cast and crew. to name but a few, the magnificent score of hugo friedhofer is a subliminal marvel, the subtle yet striking photography of greg toland, and the unbelievably effective direction by william wyler all combine with an ideal cast to create an american classic.the dvd format version is a special treat to view. what a pleasure to see "the best years of our lives" so beautifully preserved for generations to come to enjoy.

the best years of our life is often compared to it's a wonderful life. they never should be. their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. it is hard to know what value individual life may have. (how many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? what a statistic we have to live with.) also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. we have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.i have been a life long pacifist. i oppose all war. not long ago i had that position tested. it occurred while i was on the uss lexington, which is permanently anchored in corpus christi, texas. the ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which i live. it is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. she had seen a great deal of action. someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.i cannot watch the best years of our life without thinking about things like the lexington.each of the three veterans paid their dues. and they paid mine as well.no one of them got off any easier than any other. the navy, air force and army paid equally although in different ways. each had problems directly related to the war. and each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. it took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.the moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. the obvious case is when derry told herald to marry the girl. don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. it is hard for harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. but to his credit, harold listens.the other is when al tells derry to stay away from his daughter. the meaning was clear. mend your relationship with your wife ¬ñ standard fair for 30's/40's films. derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for al's daughter. so he agreed. the truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about derry. real emotions from real people. i think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. i sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. that's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.al is not free of advice he does not totally want. any time his boss talks to him, al gets tied in knots. and rightly so. there are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.all of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as derry himself. he can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.i gave the best years of our lives a 10 and there are few films i feel that way about. this is not a film for popcorn. it deserves our attention. we are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. we ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.

very glad to see that this excellent film gets such high marks from the users of imdb. the best years of their lives remains the finest cinematic statement about veterans returning from war that i have come across. easily the finest performance by the often overlooked frederick march. in fact the entire cast shines, including music legend hoagy carmichael who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic lazy river. i would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies.

i watch this movie every time it plays on tv. a simply brilliant film. three men return home from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. all three led opposite lives during the war (executive banker became an army corporal, a soda jerk became an air force captain and the high school football hero loses both his arms in battle)and now each must reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality. the homes they return to, with grown children and independent, working women along with a depressed economy, only add to the strife. it's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly, however. the awkward intimacy of frederich march and myrna loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking.dana andrews is riveting as the handsome, decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform.the film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actor.this film, however, took on a whole other level after seeing, "saving private ryan." the reality and magnitude of what these men lived through for love and country......and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield.this is an essential for any collection.

in 2004, i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie: ***** to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. i think in many ways "the best years of our lives" is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid-1940s after wwii. i believe "coming home" and "the deer hunter", both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in "the best years of our lives".what really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.this movie still packs a wallop and i'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****i'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on imdb and afi. also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic, it's a wonderful life, arguably, the best years of our lives' oscar wins, including best picture, were very well-deserved. i've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, the best years of our lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture.

everyone agrees about the technical excellence of this film by jutra (whose life ended short so tragically). as for the content, of course it makes a difference if you're a quebecker, and this explains some of the divergence of opinions. for me, it is to cinema what vignault's "mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" is to song. in addition, jean duceppe was himself a part of legendary quebec.this film can be contrasted with "crazy", a current quebec release that is successful enough to be showing here in spain and is also about the 1960s. urban quebec (crazy) vs. rural quebec (antoine). but also a film that must be something very different for foreigners and for people who know quebec from the inside.

this isn't quite the best canadian film ever, imo. i won't get off track and name 3 or 4 better. just a couple of nights before i'd seen "the bicycle thief", the highly rated italian classic, and there are some parallels. both filmmakers shot their film in a specific time and specific place, with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast. and the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and characters alone. the lingering shots over faces and landscape almost make this worth watching on its own. that being said, this one isn't quite in the same league as the italian classic. the movie is shot in a frigid, barren quebec asbestos mining town. that frigidity is contrasted with the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker claude jutra. basically, what you get is a series of vignettes that are likely nostalgic recollections of jutra - not ha, ha funny - but poignant, and probably sometimes difficult at the time, but now warmed over with the patine of nostalgia. the movie meanders; there is little tension. somewhere around half to two thirds way through the story begins. everyone you've met to this point is involved, and you've gotten to know these characters rather well; so have a little patience at the outset. the story is a good one; it will leave you thinking, and it involves sex, love and death, all the basic elements. if you like bergman, godard, truffaut, all that kind of stuff, you won't be disappointed by this.

i saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it. my uncle antoine is much, much greater than the sum of it's parts. the movie, loosely, is about a pre-adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in canada. there are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building. mua has a leisurely pace but have patience, the reward is coming. i believe the film was sub-titled and as with all non-english speaking movies i've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the additional necessity of lip-synching lines that don't quite fit. the english speaking amarcord is a travesty, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. my uncle antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in french.

mon oncle antoine observes the craggy face of a homespun community from various angles, slowly, taking its time through the beginning, as it should, until we emerge from shattered (but banal) hopes and expectations, into swirling ecstasies of dreams and a heart-stopping revelation about the terrible enigma of mortality.aimless pans and zooms across the snowy mountainside comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer. this restless camera work is personified in a fringe character who is equally the drifter, quitting his job at the coal mine and leaving his family to cut lumber, then quitting again and returning to the stark humanity of his boy dead. a fetching old woman cheats on her husband and a young boy dies. old things become new and new things die. throughout is the snowy whiteness, as wonder-stricken as the history of cinema.

seems like m.hazanavicius is back!the man behind "la classe am√©ricaine" comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those old-fashioned oss-117...whereas directors tend to "over-actualize" sequels of old classics (remember the avengers,urk), hazanavicius chose to work on a really cheap hero, oss-117, a kind of low-budget french 007, and decides to do it in a old-school way...the photography, the body attitudes, the fights choreography and the fx, everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50s.and it works, as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! jean dujardin embodies perfectly this stupid-arrogant-macho-selfish french spy, lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority.yes, that's it, just the way the occident uses to consider its colonies back then (and, oh no, i won't say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same area...ah ah)...he just looks like an unfrozen lino ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role.the other members of the cast fit perfectly as well, with all you can dream of russian spies, egyptian independantists and former nazis.and of course, the women, as there has to be "femmes fatales" in any good spy-movies... the plot is good (maybe not brilliant but really good enough...), taking place between actual historical facts, and remembering us in a funny way how france (and the others) treated its colonies back in those days. it all starts in 1955 with a british spy disappearing while tracking a russian cargo full of weapons in suez.then france sends his best friend, agent oss-117, to discover what happened to both the shipment and the agent... the fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be, and he slips through the story without even understanding it, solving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. i have to say i had a bad feeling about the movie, as the publicity made around it was quite frightening, and as french humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget about les bronz√©s 3 or camping...) but i was really surprised, and in the good way! i highly recommend it, whether you want a good parody of bond-esquire movies (much more fun than in d.e.b.s. for example, but less skirts) or you're a fan of that genuine and candid way of filming they had back in the 5os. yes, that's it clever and (really!) funny, you've got the point once again mr hazanavicius!

just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good. the trailers'd left me an impression of either yet another dujardin one-man-show-turned-film (√† la _brice de nice_) or an expensive, stupid french comedy. surprisingly, it's neither. secret agent oss 117 is stupid, but at least he sort of knows it, whereas i've always found that james bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse. dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humour that one would expect from a british rather than a french movie. the women and the music are beautiful. a refreshing trip into the past, when the bad guys were ex-nazis or soviet brutes, cars were shiny, and france had colonies!

this is probably one of the best french movies i had seen in a very long time! this "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end. some references to today's world are very subtle. the whole maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's french culture/environment. that said, all the jokes and - seemingly - shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context, are permitted and accepted because this is a parody. i was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that i should go too and assured me that i was going to have a great time, and indeed i had! if you liked the old 007 movies with sean connery and also like movies like airplane or hot shots, you will be delighted. i just hope this movie is released on dvd in the us... wait and see.

excellent exercise on multiple plans:- showing the not yet ended colonialism spirit in france - more generally the boring mindset of superiority from all western people- a renewal of the spy and thriller movies: oss 117 is uncultured and stupid!the good idea is that, in spite of all these messages, it is a funny film, plenty of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling.special mention to jean dujardin and berenice bejo.definitely worth seeing. wonder how it will be appreciated in us?seems to be a success in france, so probably a next version will come.

i was glad that this movie did without all the supposed depth of all too many pseudo-serious interracial movies. race was one issue, yes, but so was class...and loyalty...and honesty, etc.i also loved the idea that the love affair wasn't couched solely in the 'decorative' aspects of either character's appearance. aren't our divorce courts (on both sides of the atlantic, i daresay!) filled now with enough couples who thought 'looking good. together.' is all it takes to make a solid marriage? in any case, the tenderness and sensuality of both characters was thick enough to cut in love scenes that would have brought a rainbow to any dreary day! in other words, a light-hearted movie that's by no means a light-weight!

this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time! the director did a wonderful job showing the contrasts between social classes, a situation that is very pertinent in france today. all the characters are lovable, especially juliette and her family. the development of the romance is, while not entirely realistic, at least plausible, and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love. i found this to be a heart-warming cinderella story - but one in which cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself. i laughed through this entire film, and absolutely loved it. i recommend romuald et juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters, comedy, and nontraditional romance.

i love foreign films and this is among the best. i tend to not see this as a comedy as it is listed and find it a commentary on how we see others around us. firmine the lead in the film is not regarded must as she is a domestic in a large firm and people say and do things around her all the time that they otherwise would not say in front of others.this leaves her with a bevy of information that can make or break the mere mortal. :) this actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant tale. there is an underlying tale and almost many stories within the story in this film. i just hope that if someone does decide to make an american/english version of this film it is not the vein of three men and a baby that would definitely do a disservice to this film, a must see.....

this movie came out about the same time as pretty woman. while the general theme is the same: wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman, the characters of romuald and juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them. i have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to pretty woman in so many ways. juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer. the final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. the efforts romuald makes to win the love of juliette surpass the puny climbing scene of pretty woman a hundred times over. see this movie, it will warm your heart.

this movie is a hard-to-find gem! it is the story of juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and romuald, the president of same. he takes no notice of her, he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time. he is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette. as the cleaning woman, no one pays any attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss. the complications are wild, she is not so ordinary as she seems with five children from five different ex-husbands who are all still madly in love with her, and he is not so shrewd as he thinks he is. this movie doesn't follow a predictable path and that's what keeps you watching. the acting is superb and there are some very moving moments along the way as well. the working class displays more savvy than those above them, almost in the same way "gosford park" showed the upper crust is not all it's cracked up to be mentally. i recommend this movie very much. see it! 9/10

i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre-release last night and, though i wasn't expecting to, actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part. the rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments, probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living. the weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes. i'm not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste.like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clich√©s.

a wonderful story...so beautiful told..so intense so whit no keyboard to describe i think...,go see it feel it...,it tell's a story about love ,romance ,war,and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it ,if you don't love romance ,drama well skip it that's all i can i vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful...

i have heard an awful lot about 'the english patient' and i finally decided to get the cd and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. what i found out was a cinematic delight and should, i repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. if you are a religious, moral zealot, i am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. as i remember correctly before i watched this film i read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who i quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. when it comes to morality i agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. i must admit rarely have i seen such a wonderfully crafted film. i keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. first and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. instead let's focus on how the story was told. it's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. its set in the world war ii and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (count almazhy played wonderfully by ralph fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (juliet binoche) in war torn italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). the burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an english woman katherine (kristin scott thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war africa. the past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. the locales in the desert and in italy are beautiful and so are the characters. i am a romantic and am not ashamed to say i had tears after it ended. watch it with someone you truly love. the movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. the sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of innocence. anyway it deservedly won a bunch of oscars and i will go hunting for other works of director anthony minghella.it kind of brings back the romanticism in the david lean genre of films.it almost reminds me of 'lawrence of arabia' which was also based in the desert.happy viewing folks.

in a critical scene, as katharine clifton (kristin scott thomas) lies in the cave of swimmers, she writes something read aloud by hana (juliette binoche) in which she proclaims that "the light has gone out now, and i'm writing in the darkness..." a sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome the english patient. with such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of world war ii, taking elements of casablanca and lawrence of arabia along with some independence in the form of tuscany.the english patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of ralph fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when count alm√°sy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.many will criticize this film based on its so called "glorification of adulterers", but those who do know nothing. the contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. he wants this woman but he cannot have her, fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of alm√°sy in a way absolutely no other actor could. there couldn't have been a better actor for the job.so please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. the english patient is the best of every film to have ever won the best picture oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.

from 1996, first i watched this movie, i feel never reach the end of my satisfaction, i feel that i want to watch more and more until now, my god i don't believe it was ten years ago, and i can believe that i almost remember every word of the dialogues. i love this movie and i love this novel, absolutely perfection. i love willem defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "black night" and i always say it for many times, never being bored. i love the music of szararem, it's so much spiritualistic, made me come into another world deep in my heart. anyone can feel what i feel and anyone could make the movie like this? i don't believe so. thanks ondaatje thanks mingela.

the english patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. i say, most, because this movie, albeit very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some drawbacks. first and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? this one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. i say, if the film were an hour shorter, that would serve it only good. however, we have what we have. the winner of several oscars, the english patient is still very good. it is a deep, insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. ralph fiennes is a smashing superb actor. his hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. he is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple. he is the strongest link here. juliette binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. she adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that sikh officer. willem defoe, colin firth, christine scott thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. and then there is desert of egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green groves of italy. the nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. war is here, too. it is obvious, terrible, and bloody. then, there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, then nude bodies, adultery and all. i do not know what to say. so much of a splendid actors' work, so much of realism, so much of brutality that war brings. this is not a film for relaxation. it makes you think.

even after all these years, this remain "a perfect movie" for me. i still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over, stunned by the experience, overcome by emotion. i own the dvd (of course!) is see at least once a year. it's incomparable and i cannot add much to has already been written about its excellence and beauty. so glad others love it as much as i do! a note: the author of the book on which it's based - michael ondatje - was enchanted with the film and is quoted as saying he wished he had thought of some of the lovely scenes written purely for the movie...the way kip "invites" hana to his side with a trail of small candles, and the way he arranges for hana to view the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.

was curious to know the name of the tuscan village where the filming in italy was done. i know the villa's name: villa san girolamo, however, would like to know the exact location in tuscany. the cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area. i would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well. travel extensively in europe and africa and would am interested in visiting the areas that the book and film were about. please e-mail me with any information on the sites that any one might have. we would be very grateful. and if any one knows if the villa in tuscany is still habitable, that would be awesome as well. i await any information and i thank you in advance for your time.

there have been several comments already on the site focusing on the "prestige" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from fiennes and scott-thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. no wonder that andrew lloyd webber's acceptance speech for "evita" at that year's oscars began "well, thank god that "the english patient" had no songs in it." writing of oscar winners takes me to juliette binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. it is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for best actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. just as emma thompson's hugely well-deserved oscar for her portrayal of margaret schlegel in "howard's end" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of "goodness" involving, so binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty.

in world war ii, a badly burned amnesiac known only as "the english patient" is found in the african desert and is transported to italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery. among them are hana (juliette binoche), a canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends; kip (naveen andrews) and hardy (kevin whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and david caravaggio (willem dafoe), a canadian soldier-of-fortune who knows the identity of the english patient and has a score to settle.through flashbacks we learn the story of the patient: he is laszo almasy (ralph fiennes), a hungarian explorer who, in the late '30s, falls in with a group of british cartographers, including geoffrey clifton (colin firth) and his wife katharine (kristen scott-thomas), while mapping the deserts of north africa. after clifton leaves them on government business, katharine and clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, naturally, has a less-than-happy ending.if one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line (such as, why would a patient found in africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in italy?), then you can appreciate "the english patient" as a throwback to the intelligent, layered, sweeping epics of david lean in the '60s. much more than "titanic" or other epic romances of late, this movie puts one in mind of "doctor zhivago" and "gone with the wind" - an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop. you shouldn't expect a war film, though there are some striking (if all-too-brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic ss officer (jurgen prochnow) in particular).the movie is very ambiguous, in regards to pretty much everything. the central question of the film is: how far are you willing to go for love? as critics of the movie are fast to point out, almasy is, on the surface, a far-from-likable character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the germans, causing the death of his friend madox (julian wadham) and the torture of caravaggio, and actually killing a british soldier who has him under arrest at one point. the fact that almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point - he's in love with katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as almasy says, he hates "ownership. being owned." the two engage in a rather bold love affair (shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a christmas party) and it's clear that katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting almasy than the comparatively boring geoffrey.the 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; the romance between kip and hannah is never completely believable, and i feel the film could have done without it. but those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so i won't complain too much.like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. we do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in cairo, but it's helpful to know. the direction of anthony minghella and the desert cinematography by john seale are absolutely gorgeous; the sand dunes, sand storms, and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. gabriel yared's score is haunting and atmospheric.the acting is generally solid. fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and haunted. the difference between the almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. kirsten scott thomas is effective as katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and colin firth gives one of his best performances as geoffrey, who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting almasy. willem dafoe does nice work as caravaggio, the shifty, hunted thief-turned-spy driven by revenge. jurgen prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of jose ferrer in "lawrence of arabia" (and a similar character too): very brief, but more memorable then some of the major characters. some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: juliette binochette is nothing special, while naveen andrews is good but unremarkable. kevin whately, as kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather smallish role."the english patient" is not a perfect movie by any means, but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the movie-going public are not deserved at all. maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the leans and kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. complex to fault, brilliantly directed and shot, "the english patient" is a wonderful modern-day epic.8/10

the book is better than the film mostly because of the writer ondatje's prose. before i saw this film, someone who had seen it, told me the love depicted in this film isn't real. after seeing this film, i can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie-goers as well. frankly, some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody. but by the end, everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art. it is not specifically about love at all, it uses "love" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. it is about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. the critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or antihero's pleas for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene. this film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope epitomized in the interracial relationship between binoche's recovering character and the indian minesweeper (echoed in the sikh's buddy-buddy relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying nonsensically) and the forgiveness epitomized in the caravaggio character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's confessions for his war "crimes" (betrayal of country). i think the film could've been made even better than it is. i don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but i agree this film is not about realistic romantic love, as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet. the hero talks about how a new car, broken-down car, fast car, etc. (i'm paraphrasing) is still just a car no matter what adjective you put in front of it. she replies but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. this is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things which are usually the real reasons for wars, epitomized in something most of us want such as "cars", let's say). otherwise, we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art/drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and life-supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared. i believe "the english patient" won the oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love. awards tend to go that way. the relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in, unfortunately this view of love may be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to get together on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythic love are hard to get into, even in daydreams, which film love has always been, especially in good old hollywood. the film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing, regardless.

i can never figure if this is the artiest soap opera ever produced, or the soapiest art movie. no matter, john seale's cinematogaphy is utterly ravishing. ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, elevated to film. if there is a fault, it is in the original novel, not in anthony minghella's beautiful movie. anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book, and probably cannot read. i do not like repeating adjectives, but ravishing serves the purpose. apart from the storyline, the players excel. but it is the australian sense of light and shade that ultimately triumphs. like some antipodean dutch master, seale uses a blast of light, where van rijn would have used shade. one could weep for cinematography this magnificent.

a sweeping and deeply moving love story featuring powerful performances from ralph fiennes,willem defoe and juliette binoche.it tells the story of a badly burned man(ralph fiennes) who gets pulled out of a plane wreak during world war two and tells his nurse(juliette binoche)his story.just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful katherine clifton(kristen scott thomas)however she is married to jeffery clifton(colin firth)and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair.a very haunting and tragic story of love and desire set against some absolutely gorgeous locations in the desert.a must see especially if your a fan of anthony minghellas work but be prepared to shed a lot of tears its very moving especially at the end.

one of the most charming and, for me at least, the most powerful elements of anthony minghella's enthralling best picture-winner "the english patient" is that, in the mid 90s, when hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects, a film was created that brought back traces¬óvery powerful traces¬óof the sweeping, wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as "lawrence of arabia" (1962) and "the ten commandments" (1956). "the english patient" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. it has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories."the english patient", based on a novel by the same name by michael ondaatje, is like "the godfather: part ii" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. it's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an english patient in the post years of world war two. ralph fiennes plays the english patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by juliette binoche. apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (willem dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.that's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. the other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. the story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.to be blunt, "the english patient" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. what i really admired about the love story between ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. usually in love stories, such as minghella's later "cold mountain" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. it reminded me a lot of "vertigo" (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.performances all around were great. i was especially enthralled by the performance by juliette binoche, who took home the oscar for her performance the following year. i also liked willem dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. and of course i can't leave out fiennes and scott thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, i would be dishonest if i were to describe it as a perfect film. there are two flaws that i cannot glance over. number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. i was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between binoche and a bomb specialist played by naveen andrews. my research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and i'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a little¬Ödistracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. i was far more interested by fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.nevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. those put aside, "the english patient" is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. to me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between "casablanca" (1942) and "lawrence of arabia" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. it is a real shame that anthony minghella has left us. for he was a truly gifted filmmaker. this is all the evidence anybody needs.

the main point of the movie, imo, is the fact the joanna's whole life has been nothing but a series of facades. the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots, and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband. if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one, one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life.when joanna accidentally hits cory, she leaves the scene to call the police. by the time she returns, the police and ambulance are there, as well as people from her community, remarking "what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there?" well-respected in her community, she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done. but, she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades...great movie-i have seen it many times!

this is such a great movie to watch and all the actors put together a great film which would be enjoyed by everyone! it is very emotional in parts, so when you watch it grab a box of tissues to keep you company!! this movie doesn't deserve a rating below 10/10!

margaret colin stars as the principal figure in this story; as i watched it, i remembered her bit part in adrian lynes's "√ºnfaithful" as diane lane's neighbor in a tony ny neighborhood.this movie was surprisingly good, and diane stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crimes, and misdemeanors, which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (perish the thought!!!).it is real but not over-dramatized; the audience lives through her accident, the pain it has caused;denial; and the ultimate resolution.it is more than just a question of "what is a good person" as colin speaks to her husband....is a person's character defined by one single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action?? the questions are pertinent; it is also amusing to see several cinematic references to martha stewart (i.e. the fussy, bothersome mother);colin is reputed by her sometime friends to be a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes"....(gag); and a scene wherein colin is confronted by police;(the "friends" also betray her, later)....the denial and facades of american society are addressed; (oh, murder doesn't occur here; similar to the theme in "√§ season in purgatory", by author dominick dunne, about the true murder of martha moxley; in greenwich, connecticut); colin is aware of her crime; but consciously finds herself perpetuating the facade, until she finally breaks down;rent or buy this film; she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.

boasting the title for the sickest film ever made, pink flamingos is an undisputed classic. sure, the camerawork is shaky and off-center, the story is muddled and slow-paced, and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable, but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match.while this film is indeed an offensive one, reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it. only john waters can succeed in making rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagia, and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious. this movie must be seen to be believed.

pink flamingos: a representation of society's pastpink flamingos, a film directed by john waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life. babs johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. blatantly, you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces. was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut-wrenching occurrences, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? to side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented, but possibly true. the film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past. every leader that we as people view as `horrible' displays similar characteristics to those of babs johnson. ivan the terrible, genghis khan, adolph hitler, and joseph staling all had `troubling' childhoods. babs johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers. that is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing. however, were her actions her own fault or society's for letting her grow up the way she did. furthermore, each character in this film represents either a past leader or event. another coincidence is edith's obsession with eggs. with an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and hitler's attempt to annihilate the jews. some view hitler as a genius, others a mad man. john waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation edith was indeed mentally ill. edith's son crackers and traveling companion cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. both names, are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget. theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times, our society in america was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures. the chicken f**king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong. chicken, is a 1970's slang term for woman. therefore it might be possible that john waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through cotton and crackers actions. the antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was the marble's. marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever. pink flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that waters displayed so affluently throughout its entirety.

the story of dirty fat filth-like middle-age woman who lives out of society be knowing as the filthiest woman ever lived. can someone take her the crown? there is one couple ..... the nice film for people who don't like ordinary pieces of comedies and don't mind some disturbing sense of humor.i was very surprised seeing some scenes and love theirs pungent kind.

after watching desperate living, i was hooked on john waters films. i heard about pink flamingos and had to watch it and boy was it worth it! believe what you hear, it is trash! it is packed with everything filthy which is actually the main plot of this film. it contains the following: incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken shagging,nudity (like you never seen before- beware of baby's birthday party entertainers),poo eating,arson, trailer trash, perversion, transexuality, egg fettish, cross dressing...... you get the picture. above all, this is a definite must! just beware of the birthday party entertainer and divine wondering around the park!

"pink flamingos" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it's still hard to watch. not that i didn't enjoy the film, it's hilarious; but it's very repulsive and jonh waters pushes the envelope as far as it can go. the story concerns babs johnson (devine), she's the filthiest women alive. she lives in a trailer with her son crackers and daughter cotton. not to mention the overweight edie who's obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. then there's connie and raymond marble, two filthy perverts who are jealous of babs. they long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive. this means having their janitor impregnate kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples, flashing people in public, and even sending babs a turd in the mail. babs fights back to prove she's the most deranged person alive. which even includes incest, murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts. it's a film that's fun for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) watch "pink flamingos", but don't forget your barf bag. for more perverse, weird sex and bodily functions also see "sweet movie".

i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing "female trouble" on ifc. i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it. then, i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set. the movie is about babs johnson "the filthiest person alive" who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother,and her deranged son "crackers". in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens, drag-queens, people eating feces, torture, and all other sorts of random humiliation. the film has a soundtrack from 60's rock and roll artists. the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring. i found "female trouble" a little more fun. rated nc-17 for explicit sex, violence, and disturbing images. enjoy.

pink flamingos is a movie no word can explain. it was just as good i thought. it expands films. starting with a "multiple" beginning, and ending with a shocking, but clever ending, pink flamingos is one of the best films of the year. don't miss this opportunity to see a great film. rent it on video or see it at a late midnight showing like i did. but just see it.

well, i can safely say i'm human, wong. and i didn't throw up. i laughed. and laughed. if this movie made you puke, there is something wrong with you. but this movie is incredible. i bought it four days ago, and have watched it 5 times already. the animal cruelty gets my heart, but not long enough to be guilty. the movie is shocking, disgusting, and vulgar. the acting is horrific. what else do you want from a movie? i am a die-hard cult film maniac. pink flamingos is awesome. it makes rocky horror, as someone has said, look like the teletubbies.

centres on czech ww2 pilots ¬ñ the older frantisek, the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing honza. as the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and frantisek and honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. in their now soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. honza is severely maltreated by his communist countrymen and dies.in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german-occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf. notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip. finally they fight gallantly in the battle of britain. however, frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.in terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour. however, given the context of the film and frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the english woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.in addition, the film is a lot less clich√© than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised. dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain.in short, dark blue world is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame. highly recommended.

i absolutely loved this movie. great, realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching, genuine story also. the calm, understated manner of the lead character, franta, makes him very likable. the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time. the bond between franta and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf. the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww2 did not end in 1945, especially in russian occupied countries. the cinematography was also very good. wish i could have seen it on the big screen.

planktonrules comments must've been written on topsy-turvy day, because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth!'bluebeard's eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene, in every way -- the chemistry between colbert and cooper could not have been finer...supporting cast is superb.writing and direction are magnificent!!!like so many other comments on this board again i lament, "why can't films be like this anymore?" this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best, folks!

it's all about getting what you want when you want it. and the message of bluebeard's eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you.most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. misogynistic pirates aside, cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert. through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction.the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either cooper or colbert. the whole reason i watched the film was because they are "likable" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it's all about. such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon.

gary cooper, (michael brandon) played the role as an american millionaire who had seven bad marriages, but always divorced his wife's with plenty of money to live on. michael is in paris on business and goes into a french department store to buy a pair of pajama tops and the sales people refuse to sell him just the tops, he has to buy the bottoms or there is no sale. nicole deloiselle, (claudette colbert) listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajama's. michael becomes very interested in nicole and they have occasion to meet and go on dates. it is not too long before michael proposes marriage to nicole and she is very taken back with his request for marriage since she really does not know him very well. however, once she finds out she is going to become the eighth wife of michael she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite entertaining and funny. don't miss this film, it is great entertainment by great veteran actors. enjoy.

the lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this film. humour at anytime and very subtle. the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director. the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect. a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a xxist century spectator. the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie. she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage, very funny. and no problem, with lubitsch, there is always an happy end. a film for men too confident with women. don't let your girlfriend watch this movie...

this film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. in fact, to the tune of "the jolly fat policeman", they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing, including one of gary cooper chortling when watching a film in a movie house - a sequence from this film.it all begins innocently enough when cooper, a millionaire, goes into a fancy department store in france to buy pajamas. but he only likes to sleep in the tops. the clerk (tyler brooke) insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as cooper wants. claudette colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms. what if brooke sells them each half? brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the floor walker (rolfe sedan) and asks him if this can be done. he is disturbed too - the request is quite unconventional. eventually they contact the store's owner (charles halton). halton is in bed, and gets out - his skinny frame supporting only a pajama top (if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship). can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas (half for each)? properly horrified, halton answers, "no, of course not! that is communism!!". so the sale is not allowed. apparently nobody thinks that cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to colbert.lubitsch's bluebeard's eighth wife has had a reputation of falling flat, most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of colbert's character. she is seen as quite mercenary towards cooper - selling herself to him on her terms.actually cooper's character is the nastier, as he is rich and figures that everything has a price. he is correct most of the time. look at the way colbert's aristocratic pauper of a father, edward everett horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. cooper's willingness to marry colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages. horton, when he realizes this, takes out a watch, and (in a most reassuring voice) says to cooper - "take your time my boy!", to come to a decision. later we see horton's wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier.the film, script by billy wilder and charles brackett, compares well with their script for mitchell leisin's midnight (also with colbert, but with don ameche and john barrymore). there colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to (to francis lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to ameche. she really loves ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married "for love" but poverty made them grow to hate each other. this is not found in bluebeard's eighth wife, where colbert does not have a background like that (she is, after all, the daughter of a marquis). her mercenary plotting is to teach cooper a lesson about his standards.the film has some nice work by the supporting staff, including herman bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that colbert learns about, and a young david niven, who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to cooper. coop tells niven about his problems with colbert, and how she is so infuriating. niven listens respectfully. at the end, cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "albert, how much do i pay you?", cooper asks him. niven thinks and says, "thirty five francs a week sir.". cooper looks deeply into his soul, and says (shaking his head), "that's fair!"

ernst lubitsch gave us wonderful films like design for living, ninotchka, the shop around the corner, to be or not to be, and other wonderful films. but people usually put bluebeard's eighth wife as one of lubitsch's weakest films.but i consider this film as an important film. this film began the collaboration of charles brackett and billy wilder. charles brackett, billy wilder, and walter reisch wrote the screenplay for ernst lubitsch's ninotchka. of course, lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. after that, charles brackett and billy wilder worked together. they together wrote the screenplay for famous films like the lost weekend and sunset blvd.there are lots of funny moments in the film. i thought "the taming of the shrew" was very funny. there is a famous expression called "films are slices of life." and here is a great example from bluebeard's eighth wife (1938).at the first session of the scripting process, lubitsch posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? billy wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store. "the boy is trying to buy a pajama," he extemporized glibly. "but he sleeps only in the tops. he is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. the clerk says he must buy the pants too. it looks like a catastrophe. then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants." ernst lubitsch and charles brackett were enchanted. it wasn't till months later they discovered that billy wilder himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.i got this information from a book. i think this film can be considered as the return of ernst lubitsch. right after this film, he made wonderful films like ninotchka, the shop around the corner, and to be or not to be.i thought gary cooper's performance was good. i think lubitsch casted gary cooper probably because gary cooper played long fellow deeds who inherited the fortune in frank capra's mr. deeds goes to town. but this is just my opinion.as for me, i highly enjoyed the film. i rate this film 9 out of 10. lubitsch films are different, because his films are slices of life.

years before pre-nuptial agreements became a regular thing, ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. bluebeard's eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the french riviera who's been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight. but cooper's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $50,000.00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him. sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement.of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage. she'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it.bluebeard's eighth wife has some really funny moments, the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a men's store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms. and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her. herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective.i've often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non-french in a film like this. of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background. though david niven is charming as always, having him be a frenchman is ludicrous, he is sooooooo british.nevertheless bluebeard's eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the lubitsch touch' back in the day.

for some perverse reason best known to themselves these imdb boards seem reluctant to credit the great billy wilder as co-scriptwriter on at least two (this one and ninotchka) of his early classics when any buff can detect the wilder hand at work. as it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with charles brackett (who does get a credit) and it was a great start. one commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old-fashioned cinemas and i couldn't agree more. in paris one of the smaller revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous lubitsch retrospective and i'm pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though i doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938. the famous wilder schtick the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but-careful-with-it cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the riviera and meets with sales resistance until claudette colbert turns up and agrees to buy the other half. the gag is milked even more when, having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner, who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he, too, is only wearing the top half of pajamas. the film is full of sight-gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect. claudette colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from edward everett horton as her impoverished titled father. david niven in fourth billing has some funny 'business' as does franklin pangborn and if gary cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well, you can't have everything and what you do have is darned near perfect.

there is something about seeing a movie in a good, old-fashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture. i, fortunately enough, was able to see at film forum in new york city a pair of ernst lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director. the double feature i attended was a screening of lubitsch's 1938 comedy bluebeard's eighth wife and the pre-code classic design for living, neither of which i had seen before. everything i read of design for living praised the film, but i could not find a good review anywhere for bluebeard's eighth wife. leonard maltin disliked it.videohound, too, gave the comedy a low rating.its imdb score was not complimentary.and pauline kael (not a great surprise) blasted the film in her scathing review. so, when i went into the city that day i was expecting to enjoy bluebeard's eighth wife only slightly and love design for living completely. bluebeard's eighth wife (which was showing first) began, as the eccentrics who populate the cinema took their seats and the thirties music subsided. `adolph zukor presents claudette colbert and gary cooper in ernst lubitsch's bluebeard's eighth wife,' the title card read. then the picture opened with a hilarious scene: cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he doesn't want any part of the bottoms! he gets into a squabble with the clerk, who seeks the help of his higher bosses, and their seems to be no end to the argument. enter claudette colbert, one of thirties cinema's most beautiful, charming, and talented personalities. `i'll take the bottom,' she kindly intercedes. and there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest `meet cute' ever. the film kept my interest wonderfully.i found myself laughing almost constantly. when colbert discovers, just before a family portrait is taken, that her groom-to-be has been married seven times, the entire theatre broke into histerics. when she bargains for money immediately after she gets over her shock, the laughs (which still haven't ceased) intensify. and edward everett horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the script as well. when cooper takes inspiration from shakespeare's the taming of the shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face, i could not control my laughter when she slapped him back. and the drunk scene with the scallions is one of claudette colbert's funniest comic scenes. the greatest comic moment of the film came when colbert highers a boxer to `teach her husband a lesson.' in pure screwball fashion, he knocks out the wrong man, instead putting her friend david niven into a cold sleep. he awakes as cooper is arriving. in order to cover up the situation, colbert herself, in a moment of strong sexiness, puts her fist up to niven, asks: `where did that man hit you? here? right here? right here?' and then bam! knocks him out again! the film was wonderful, from beginning to end it was a perfect delight. i loved design for living, too, though i dare say i think for sheer laughs and entertainment bluebeard's eighth wife was the better and more enjoyable film. there is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen. and in the presence of others laughing, one feels more comfortable doing so himself. that is, perhaps, why i felt the way i did about bluebeard's eighth wife.

when i first saw colleen moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called "hollywood". there she was in 1980, her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of "presence". then i saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "ella cinders" and "orchids and ermine". then the disappointingly sombre talkie "the scarlet letter". and now here she is in "the power and the glory" giving a performance of staggering power, working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors - spencer tracy.i found the movie a little lack lustre story-wise, but moore and tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter. both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film - and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. moore is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife, and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes i have ever seen. she does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge, even over tracy. contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and tracy is struggling to propose to her. astonishing! what this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.

supercarrier was my favorite movie in the later part of the 80's when it came out. my dad taped it for me & i watched it all the time until my step-mom taped oprah over it & my heart was torn. i would love to know if or where i can get it from. i have been looking for it. i believe they even came out w/ a supercarrier 2. it wasn't as great as the 1st, but i would like to have all of them if i could find them. i do not think @ all that it was a bad movie. it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it. the actors/actresses in the movie were great. it also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world, but it is also a woman's world & many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do & women deserve much respect for their duties as well.

let's get this out of the way, so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word "breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move along: this is not in any way pornographic. on the contrary, if this has any value as masturbation material then, frankly, the filmmaker didn't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. indeed, i would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on dvd or, if it ever plays again, late night on hbo or cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure. you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh, well, you get the idea.no, this is semi-serious film-making meant for premium late-night viewing, but it shouldn't have to be just for the late-night types. this is intimate in setting but not in tone. all of the women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and races, and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts, have something of value to say, from life experience in the most straightforward way. if i say semi-serious it's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in, with the archival footage of old "how-to" videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the knockers flying about. this isn't a problem but an asset: we need a few little visual seg-ways to go between these interviews.nothing is held back, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don't need to cover up, and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood, and, sadly, cancer. in that last part, there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. you know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi-normal life with one breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it), and you don't snicker or go "eww, gross." that's the test, folks.it's not shot under the best of circumstances, but then again for tv it's edited with a tight pace. it's never dull for a moment, and we never feel like anyone is holding back, especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. breasts: a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare. if that's worthy of a "i was alone" session, then, well, more power to you, i guess, though it's not the intention.

this is a wonderful look, you should pardon the pun, at 22 women talking about breasts-- theirs, their mothers', other women's, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. young girls, old women, and everyone in between (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc) talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, enhancing, or reducing their breasts.it's charming, delightful, sad, funny, and everything in between. intercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous old "young women's films" that the girls got taken to the cafeteria to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women & their breasts into what the other half has to say when they don't know you're listening.

in the spirit of the great space coaster, but a few years earlier.hot fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that i grew up on. seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, i recall him wearing a variety of elton john-type shades.he "played" piano, and had a jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. they would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it.don't remember much else except the opening theme, seymour and the hippie.no one else i know remembers it at all. i grew up in jersey, so if it was produced in detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. seymour reminded me a lot of sherlock the squirrel from the magic garden (another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) people always talk about lsd's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well.

this educational show focused on emotions, interactions, and relationships. it was produced at detroit's abc affiliate and syndicated in 90 markets nationwide. this past week, detroit public tv had a 1-1/2 hour clip show as part of their pledge drive. wow, the memories that resurfaced! while i remembered the show, there were segments that i'd forgotten about but remembered instantly a soon as they'd begin ("hot fudge holy moley!", detective tomato and the pies in his face).for more on the public television special, do a search for "hot fudge comin' atcha concert"

every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid. there were some funny looking puppets called "the mitts" who would always discuss childhood things. they would play this song before "the mitts" part of the show that goes like this "let's join the mitts..." there was a groucho marx puppet that told jokes. before the session, this man would sing "hot fudge! right on!" there was a green puppet with teeth that was called seymore. we would always see more seymore. he would crack jokes and sing every episode. there was always a moral in every episode. one episode, a man sang "liars are losers!" another episode he was singing about sharing and caring. seymore said tell me about those two little girls "sharon and karen." the hot fudge holey moley part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music.

my favourite story from 'tales from the crypt'. brion jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack,axe swinging madman steve dixon.having seen him before in tango&cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved. a jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed.and you know when dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay!the young worker ted(billy wirth)receives an almighty beating from dixon leaving him blind.now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work? a tribute to black humour if there ever was one! the co stars do a pretty good job too supporting ted when dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man.dixon's behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues.one even stated he became a changed man when he got married.though ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!

this enchanting movie is based on a novel by arto paasilinna. the bestseller is one of the best books i've read. here's the story:one day journalist and photographer kaarlo vatanen decides to leave his past behind, and starts a new life wandering across the finnish forests and countryside. with him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. vatanen has to take care of the hare, because it's leg is wounded, so they start a journey together taking care of each other.in the course of their adventures they get almost shot by hunters, get caught by the police, meet many people and finally get to lapland, where they live peacefully, until a group of foreign tourist disturbs their privacy. the hare falls ill and they must return to helsinki to see the vet.vatanen has found an ideal way of living, but the modern society tries to tie him back to his duties and taxes. in helsinki vatanen took to drink, gets even engaged and imprisoned, but finally he and the hare flee.

j√§niksen vuosi is one of jarva's most political movies. it takes stance strongly against modern day society's authority status in the life of the common man, and how it has estranged men from the nature completely. it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society.vatanen (antti litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland - only to realize that the concept of a 'free country' isn't all that unambiguous, in other words, the society has the common man by the balls.still the thing that makes j√§niksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the 70's, as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation. vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness. since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns, the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes j√§niksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving.

all risto jarva's films are worth of seeing. some like "j√§niksen vuosi" and "loma" are best films in their genre and have reached a status of a classics in finnish cinema-history.most people have formed a impression of actor antti litja through jarva's films. litja acted leading role in three of jarva's films which all became successes at box office and movie reviews.it's nice to see that idea of "j√§niksen vuosi" still lives in commercials (i think it was tele-operator sonera's tv add where litja was walking in mountain fell at lapland with hare in his arms. everibody who has seen the film knows what i am talking about..) "j√§niksen vuosi" is a beautiful film with great actors and good filming locations - like famous small town in lappland, sodankyl√§, where the best film festival in the world is held - the midnight sun film festival. i recommend it for all to go there on june - but remember warm clothes and raincoat :)

a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition, with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face.should be compulsory viewing for all politicians.take your pick from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life.reminiscent of thoreaus' walden, but with modern twist, and considerable humour. i'm not finnish, although i've travelled there and have good finnish friends, but i found it totally accessible, and also culturally informative.

an excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone. i liked this movie because glenn corbett also appeared in star trek as zeffrem cochrane in 1967. i also liked it because i am a fan of the apollo space program.

i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is.i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973, when it was "the stranger" and i loved it. such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality, when shows like "search", "ufo", and "6m$ man" were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. adventure and technology.you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them. the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it; they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it.i did not know what this concept of a "pilot" was. i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that stryker would get home; did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours.back then, would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now? i doubt it because i don't remember it as such. do i understand now? not really for to understand the story, one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie.if one is watching as an american, it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state.....but if one is a subject in that state, then compliance could be expected and security can be less. when things are suppose to be perfect, perfect to an extreme degree, perfect that one is not suppose to doubt, then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order.the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power.these days, one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it, so much of the suspense, surprise is lost. but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr. one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns.this is the primary difference between "the stranger" and "doppelganger". the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the ussr are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie. in the former, those links are through out the movie, supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards.all that said, despite my fond memory for the movie, it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series. each week, stryker would make friends, benedict would chase, stryker would get away. eventually, benedict's society would get rid of him. someone else would pick up the chase. a rut would develop. there might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from stryker's mission showing up, but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going.if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie, odds are they will slash it as well. but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time, of what the popular environment contained for the viewer, then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it.

i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child. thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it. for years i did not know the name, but the movie stuck in my mind. the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually. it was a shame it did not make it to a series. this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun. also known as doppleganger. if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch. it was done before the stranger, but shares a similar plot. yet different. i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs. hope they make a dvd, but it is doubtful unless it comes out on dollar dvd. a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd's and maybe this one will.

tourist trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's, the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum.the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off, who is responsible for the murders, is it old man slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood!!!! this film was good stuff, it was fast faced, the performances were very good from the actors/actresses (tanya roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring, and like i say, it had some very creepy scenes, so be prepared to hide under the covers! definitely recommended to horror movie/ghost story fans! i give this film a highly respectable 7.2 out of 10.

i have to admit thanks to this movie i'm now afraid of mannequins. hahaha.but yes, first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty swell. most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. the script also seems to be pretty good too, sure some cheesy stuff in there but also some decently written character and some damn scary scenes. i still get shivers thinking about that one scene with the dude and the mannequins. brrr.yeah, i'll say you should check this movie out it's pretty good, and very entertaining. a good watch. 8/10

a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other's jeep mysteriously won't start). one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice mr. slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about "davy", his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there. of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. is it slaussen? is it davy? the mannequins?? tourist trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending. i started to feel sorry for slaussen (chuck conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of molly doing the same. this is a gem if you can find it; i had taped it off of cable when i was younger, and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it. fans of tanya roberts won't be disappointed either. best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers!!)i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain.

a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond, where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies, and the only form of help is affable local mr. slausen (chuck connors). as night falls, the kids get picked off in record time.an odd, freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of all-too-lifelike mannequins (making this a good update of the "bodies in the wax museum" genre), this is an intense shock fest along the lines of "the texas chain saw massacre". (it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a. burns repeats that duty here, and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy.) pino donaggios' score is downright chilling; accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg, it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphere.plot twists vary in level of success; there was one that i saw coming a mile away, and one that actually took me by surprise, and i was all the more happier for it. one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front, as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition. the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the end.star connors offers an engaging performance as our down-home good ol' boy antagonist, while the younger co-stars, predictably, can't perform at the same level, although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damsel-in-distress. co-star tanya roberts (a brunette in this film) is okay in support. (if i had one problem with this film, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid. then again, that doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 80's.) future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou, who was the editor here, ron underwood (who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with "tremors") as the assistant director, and veteran makeup artist ve neill, who's done many films and won three oscars since.although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto. recommended.8/10

"tourist trap" is among my favorite late 70's/early 80's horror flicks. a group of young people are heading somewhere, one pair in the car ahead, & that car has a flat, and our film opens with the young man, woody, pushing the tire along looking for a service station. he finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. along comes the rest of the young folks (in a vw thing) and they pick up woody's girlfriend, and find this very same place, slausen's oasis, or some such thing..and then mr. slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. of course, the vw thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd mr. slausen (chuck connors) offers his help. mr. slausen has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says davey lives. and who is davey? why, davey crockett, he says...but if it were davey crockett, they'd all probably be safer. the girls are left alone while slausen goes to help with fixing the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...davey. what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one, they're taken prisoner by davey, who says he's slausen's brother. one girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial, which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. at any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) mr. slausen is not exactly what he appears to be. a good, creepy late 70's horror flick, and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.

i really really liked this one. i know, it's rampant with what are now clich√© plot lines, and plenty of overacting, but it was hell of a lot of fun.in our quest for 70's and 80's horror cheese, we come across many flicks that are so bad they're good. we also have some that are so 'good' they suck, and then, we have some that are so bad they are just bad. this is definitely so bad it's good.some teens traveling come across an 'oasis' in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten slice of roadside america, and they decide to 'check it out.' they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. they pay dearly.i would not normally give a movie like this a 9, but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970's: ditzy, scantily-clad and fit. these aren't the anorexic broads from today's horrible horror; they look awesome in booty shorts.i give it a 9 out of 10, kids.

perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after halloween (although made from irwin yabalans from halloween), i must say i honestly found "tourist trap" to be scarier and funner. "tourist trap" is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then, and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise. it was destiny i tell you, but one night i was at my local blockbuster (one or two months before it went out of business), and had nothing to get. then i stumble upon this movie, i think huh seems like a laughable b-movie, i rent it and took it home, boy was i in for a good scare. "tourist trap" comes off as a bad movie, it definitely has it's cheesy moments,but in the end you're having to much fun with it to really care.the things that impressed me the absolute most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i've seen, is number one the setting. a horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun, not here. i just love love love the location, it feels like we can relate to it, it almost feels like we've been there before. which makes it creepier. next is the characters, non of them are really stereotypical, and they all have a real personality. for example they're not stoners, alcoholics, or even sex obsessed people, they feel like normal young adults. plus they look realistic enough, and then their is chuck connors. who gives a great performance as mr. slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again he's so real, he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore. the last, and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump half way out of our seats, and turn on the rights, for the right reasons. for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch, but in "tourist trap" prepare yourself, that's not the case. with it's perfect use of lighting, mannequins, and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out. plus i love because although they may go a bit over-the-top with some things you still feel like this could happen. which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do, and that is make us (the audience) feel unsafe and terrified.overall as far as any major problems go, i have none, only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times. however in the end "tourist trap" holds a place near and dear to my heart, for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling.

after a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr. slausen (chuck connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins. once at the creepy roadside attraction, the friends are stalked by a mask-wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind.tourist trap's bad guy is a demented cross between the texas chain saw massacre's leatherface and anthony, the scary kid from the classic twilight zone episode 'it's a good life', whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned tcm, hitchcock's psycho, and house of wax. the atmosphere and execution of tourist trap, however, is so totally off-kilter that, in this respect, it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies.director david schmoeller's continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant left-field performance from connors, an impossibly creepy score from pino donaggio, a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of super sexy tanya roberts, who spends the film in (and briefly out of) tiny denim hot-pants and a figure hugging boob-tube, tourist trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following.

slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie but believe me this one among those pearl that will stay longer after you turned of tv set. especially if you are a person easily scared this is the movie for you for which you wouldn't have stomach to take it full. even after so many years the movie hasn't lost its charm and thrill.no blood no gore but the thrill will for sure chill your spine out. the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same pace till its end. bgm is nerve cracking and i remember this was the one copied in many indian movies those days. kings favorite? no wonder why... thats the only reason i wanted to see this and it didn't let me down. "don't turn off the lights"... coz you wont find enrique but may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! beware. not for the lite hearted...two thumps up and i am going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but still i preserve my ratings for dramas...

let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then 99.9% of the horror films that have come out of hollywood lately. if you don't believe me see darkness falls or they. and it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like stab, bleed, the pool, and so on. one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience. when the film opened in 1979 it was given a pg rating by the mpaa. anyone that knows horror films knows that a pg on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film. (director david schmoeller talks about this problem on the dvd's commentary track.) there are exceptions though like poltergeist, which had also received a pg rating. however, there are big differences between tourist trap and poltergeist. tourist trap was not a big budget hollywood film like poltergeist nor was it produced by steven spielberg. that alone was enough to guarantee poltergeist success. (still for those of you that have seen tourist trap, you will even scratch your head as to why the mpaa rated this film pg. the 'heart burst' scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and r rating. or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it.) i have to admit though that when i was young i looked at a copy of poltergeist in the video store shelf, picked it up, saw that it was rated pg and put it back on the shelf in favor of an r rated film instead. years later, i finally saw poltergeist and realized what a great film i missed out on for not renting a pg horror film. from then on i would never judge a film based on it's rating again. this is most likely what happened to tourist trap. people, like me with poltergeist, will probably overlook it in favor of the r rated film. most likely it would be a teenager too, which most of these types of films are targeted at. friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated r and was heavily advertised by paramount at the time. it found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels. when you look at it folks, tourist trap is just as good as friday the 13th. the same thing could've happened to tourist trap. we could have seen tourist trap 2, 3, 4, and so on. as far as the film goes, tourist trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget, but it is well acted, well directed and well made on many levels. chuck connors is a riot as mr. slausen and gives the best performance in the film. special credit must be give to composer pino donaggio, whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness. the music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy. donaggio worked on the horror film carrie and many other film scores since tourist trap. he has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day. the weakness with tourist trap is that there really is never any explanation of davey's powers. maybe that is how it's supposed to be. he just has them, and we should accept that in order for the movie to work. we do accept it to a point, but then the screenplay has incidents like how davey makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. in that case, is davey limited in using his powers? can he make a phone ring in houston, detroit, los angeles? what is his range? those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws. others would accept it as a mistake. i accept it. there is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it. this is a horror film. we should not be required to read too much into it. many people have called this the 'killer mannequin' movie. i assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film. the mannequins are controlled by the power of davey who uses them as a weapon. this is a common misconception about this film. some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly. i think they add to the overall creepiness of the film. overall tourist trap is a good fun rental.***(out of 5)

this is a bizarre oddity, directed by the guy who edited "the texas chainsaw massacre." chuck conners gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the owner of a roadside "wax" museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near. the wax figures look "so real," one of the teen's points out. heh, heh, heh...not so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned "house of wax"-style terror. i can think of many, many horror films that are worse than this one.

son in law didn't do so hot in the box office, but that only means the masses were wrong. this movie is one of the few movies that pauly shore really excels in, with some of the funniest lines i've ever heard. although the ending is sub-par, the antics of shore carries the movie.

conrad phillips stars in the 1950s action adventure series - william tell. set in the fourteenth century during the hostile austrian occupation of switzerland, william tell is a reluctant freedom fighter, battling heroically against the tyranny and oppression of the invading forces. william tell is the swiss version of robin hood. conrad phillips plays the protagonist fantastically. it is possible that pascal bugnion would have had greater success in the role, but he was unavailable at the time of filming. the classic action show is made up of series of 39. the episodes are in black and white, but this does not detract from the entertainment in any way.

you could tell from the opening shot of the conveyor belt in the bank that this was going to be a great film.a touch minimalist in feel with a twist of retro this film oozes style -the brilliant camera-work, acting, script and the manner that the secret life of the protagonist unfolds all complement each other in possibly making the best italian film i've ever seen (up there with la stanza del figlio - albeit different).shame on the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they couldn't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously crafted by the camera. don't miss.

an amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat. brilliantly orchestrated in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. the acting was generally well-done (the "director" should've asked alec guinness for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio). this movie didn't let up since the opening scene...

this may be the most tension-filled movie i have ever seen.in fact, it's so nerve-wracking, i haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago, but i will since i have the dvd. there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to "escape" for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else. the russian actress marina zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character in here is a mute. she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker. after the day's shooting is done and "billie" is about to leave, she hears something. she takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a "snuff film" and actually killing someone. billie's eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse-type building.there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out. the first i described above. the second scene, the climactic one, goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first. in fact, the film should have been trimmed a bit but, overall, since it's so good at keeping our attention, then it served its purpose as entertainment.

i rarely watch short films as they only seem to be on late night television and are not publicised enough for me to know which short films are worth while. as the room is an extra feature on the hitcher dvd, it gave me a wonderful opportunity to witness a high quality short with rutger hauer in excellent form.artistically shot in black and white, the room explores a man's obsession with a room he passed by in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in a documentary/ interview style. the dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman, but is also juxtaposed with ramblings and occasional deficiencies in fluency. this adds great realism and depth to hauer's performance who is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him.the piano music that harry (hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and enhances the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by hauer.hauer proves he is more than just a psychotic hollywood bad guy with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side. mattijn hartemink is also effective in the flashback scenes as young harry with a silent role. he shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it goes away.the ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature length films. a very good effort.

co-directed by and starring rutger hauer, this film short was based on a short story by dutch writer harry murlisch.in the 10 minutes of the film's length you will get to see a life-time as 'harry' unravels his long-time fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth. returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same room.using black and white film the textures are accentuated in this delicate telling of a tale. the voice of 'harry' drawing you into his world.a subtle, tight performance from rutger hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. wonderful soundtrack by dutch musician dyzack.at the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on dvd region 2 "l'infidele" (liv ullman) as a bonus track. but is due to be on the re-released dvd of "the hitcher" - another tight, but very different performance from hauer!see this film if you can!

ok. who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all slit their throats. this "film" was absolute and utter filth. what the heck was up with the weird old bags eyes? seriously, was she on some sort of horrible drug and then she like just thought she could control people? she was running around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what? do i have a booger hanging out of my nose? what are you staring at? are you like the sea witch or something? all and all though i thought the graphics were top notch old chap. for that alone i would give it a ten. but just cover your ears when you are watching it. the pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall off. who knows? you might even get a knot in your small intestine. you better watch out fools.

i remember watching this film in 1981, when i was 7. it was absolutely brilliant! i found the dvd just a couple of months ago. i was nearly jumping up and down with glee!! i bought it and showed it to my kids. they loved it too. they asked what words the seahorse was singing (i didn't tell them, though, because i don't think telling the words 'gay' and 'ecstasy' to 6 year old kids is very good parenting). the songs are brilliant. i still remember them all. i'll still remember them when i'm 60! there, or near abouts. tommy pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. it's a pity he gave it up.if you find the film, buy it! you'll love it!

i just finished this movie and my only comment is "oh! wow!". jennifer beals is ok as the fiancee, but yancy butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! having watched her in witchblade, i was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen.i gotta see this movie again....if only for yancy butler as corrinne!

i felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for eleanor bergstein. the primary actors (campbell scott, jennifer beals, yancy butler, james goodwin iii, patrick stewart, and leslie caron) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence. it was a very uplifting movie that i wish was available on tape or dvd. a rare gem.

love this little film, that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem, shall we dance? (not the overblown gere/jlo remake...) luckily i found it and taped it when it was showing on a starz promo weekend, because as far as i know, it's not available on dvd. i'll watch just about anything with yancy butler (anyone remember the short-lived tv series mann and machine ???) in it, and she positively shines in this. she does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy hot!! loved all the other characters in it, especially the ones played by patrick stewart and leslie caron (where's she been all these years?). this is one of those films that i take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it. recommended highly!!!

meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970's, this movie plays more like something mr. schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway. a mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in florida, and along the freeway of life, the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor. the problem is that what didn't end up on the cutting room floor probably should have! now available on dvd, it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $100 million to produce had it been made in 2004. it rolls along and isn't too difficult to sit through, and, strangely enough, in 2004 we're all still pretty much justhopping in our cars and going faster and faster, heading nowhere.

i found this movie on netflix and had to add it to my queue. i wasn't disappointed when i got it as it's just as funny now as when i saw it at a local drive-in theater back then.it builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across america on the "honky tonk freeway, america on wheels." this was a strange comedic role for william devane as i remember him as kennedy in the 1974 tv film "the missiles of october" and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he did.it reminds me a bit of dick van dyke in "cold turkey' where van dyke played the local minister. devane's role as mayor, minister, and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and real.howard hessman and teri garr as the spoiled family in the rv was on target for the time as well. anyone who has traveled across country with small children, (are we there yet?) will appreciate those scenes.the scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town i grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns. it's sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive. (used zoo animals anyone?)all in all, it's a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at america during the early 80's. well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer.

back in august, '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like "urban cowboy", "every which way but loose", "smokey and the bandit" were all the rage. for that reason i suspect the producers of this movie chose "honky tonk freeway" as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same "urban cowboy" crowd. instead "honky tonk freeway" bombed at the theaters and i suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title. thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it's time. no matter what, probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it.its too bad this movie bombed. but i think it would have anyway even if it hadn't been saddled with a poor title. its a movie ahead of its time. one could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or *great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today. for its day "honky tonk freeway" was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn't get popular in comedy till much later on. while clearly its a child of "airplane", its more mature, and while its certainly no "knocked up" it clearly points in that direction. the characters are more "comedy-mature" in that they are low-key and don't ever think anything they do is anything other than serious. the jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations.but, more than that, "honky tonk freeway" is a real time capsule. a great look back at the exceedingly early 80's. the people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did. it was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them.i don't know if my review is helping you, but this is really a good, sometimes kind of excellent, movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger. beverly d'angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes. so are beau bridges and terri garr. terry garr was just about to become the toast of hollywood as her next movie after this one was "tootsie" which finally made her a star. howard hessmann was arguably the biggest "current" star of the the day when this movie was made. back in 1981 howard hessmann was the star of the big hit tv show "wkrp in cinncinatti". he played its lead character, the rascally night dj. daniel stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80's sitcom "the wonder years" there are also several faces that are no longer with us these days, its nice to see hume crowyn and jessica tandy as a an old married couple on a journey. jessica tandy would finally pick up her oscar ten years after this for "driving miss daisy". there is also the great geraldine page in one of her final movie appearances. though she'd had a brilliant career she didn't get her oscar till four years after this in 1985's "trip to bountiful", for which she richly deserved it, and she died very soon after getting that award.plus, there are lots of other faces in this movie, actors who aren't big stars but who have done tons of supporting work. many are familiar even if you can't think of their name.this movie is a pleasant little diversion. a bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all, in a vaguely altman-esk way, end up heading towards florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of ticlaw, florida, which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the map.and thats also what this movie is about, fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system, which had only recently been "completed". it had taken a generation to build, from when it was authorized by congress around 1960, through many years as different parts were built and then "went live" and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is. and people were enchanted by it. everybody by 1980 was pretty much an "interstate freeway veteran" in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs, only on and off ramps, and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible. by 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom. and this was all new then. the ending is anti-climatic and isn't that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment. what makes it great is it's the journey not the destination that makes honky tonk freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day. forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane.

a wonderful film ahead of its time,i think so, in the eighty's it was all about winning, greed is good ? remember that one ? i have seen this film more that 20 times, to me this is a real desert island film, i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love, jessica tandy, and hume cronin, are simply wonderful,also beverly d'angelo, beau bridges come in at a close second, don't get me wrong there are many more great performance's in this film, and it is also the way it is written that made it for me, and i hope you, a film that you will want to see over and over, i think tv shows like "northen exposure", and now "earl" owe a lot to this film. but remember it is not a tom cruise film.

i remember watching this movie over and over again when i was a kid. i loved it. whilst i haven't watched it recently, i am sure i would enjoy it just the same today. its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. the situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! i particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion) , the robbers and the nuns. this nice humour style is much missed these days. also, this movie proved that actor paul keenan (dynasty/days of our lives) was off to a great start. i recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop.

a notorious big budget flop when released. this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. if you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part. rent if from netflix, if you read this, i bet you will enjoy it.

in the early '80s, i recorded honky tonk freeway from the cable. since then i have waited, hoping it would be on dvd. yesterday i found it. it is one of the best humorous character studies i ever saw. the old fashioned episode is priceless. at this time (4/28/02) only two have reviewed it. one hated it, the other loved it. if you have a dvd player, either rent it, or buy it as i did.

very memorable comedy. it's fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest honky-tonk) - the great american freeway. like "...mad, mad world" it's got loads of contemporary talent, old-boy politics, good comedic action and dialog. unlike that one it is the target that seeks, not the unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they drift along america's great road. nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly-laugh. but the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing, humor and timing, and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular. the total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling. the slapstick is funny, but honky tonk freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed. all in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the goofy situations we find ourselves in. it was just meant to be funny and it is!

this movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but i loved it. one measure of a movie's worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years. i won't bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes, also a good story and great casting. the inept robbers are a hoot. see it and judge if it ever gets on tcm.

this is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard-core marine 'raider'. gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. vincent's character, whose name is marion, takes gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine 'raider'. marion hitch-hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell-like little town. in the local caf√© he meets rose hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. staying with hudkins parents, marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine 'raider' could still be so innocent. the story also brings up the japanese internment camps, as the towns folks go 'hunting' 3 escapees. marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. but there's still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. i would have preferred a little more drama! anyway, this captures jmv at the peak of his 70's performances. buster and billie, baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid-70's were amazingly good jmv performances. he was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! he made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great tv show airwolf. he does a very good job in this as 'hedge', quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. he must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me! but really, at the height of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with jmv's talent and his looks. innocence can only be so interesting. evil, as explored in "buster and billie", is much more dramatic! anyway, glynnis o'connor is delightful as rose. the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting. the outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in canada.

i first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. the opening narrative, music and paintings by norman rockwell set the tone for me. you either love the movie or hate it. jan michael vincent was at his all time best and portrayed cpl marion hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. this movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame it isn't available on dvd or vhs anymore. the ending was also wonderful. john hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.

when i first saw the poster of this movie, i discarded it off as another low-budget movie targeting youth. after some days, when it finally made it to the theaters, one of my friends told me it's a good one.a year later, the first time when i saw the advertisement that, anand was going to be aired on television and the moment finally came as i flipped channels and for a moment i stopped to watch and that's it i ended up watching the whole movie.and by now, 3 yrs later i'd have watched the movie at least 7-8 times and i don't really watch movies again and again!!this movie is great because it tries to be different, when all telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights.it's a simple movie, a bit slow but a very gripping screenplay, there're no loose ends in the movie, very well-versed dialogues, which is really-really hard to find by.music is both classic and soothing, great renditions by radha krishnan, some great kirtanas also come in the bgmusic, through out the movie.cinematography, deserves a mention. editing is not slick but adequate for a romantic one such as this.but, what really blows you out in this movie is two things- 1.the way each scene has been treated with utmost respect by, the now famous, shekar kammula.2. the beautiful lyrics by veturi.and one more thing deserves a special mention, kamalini, part of her success attributed to sunitha, for lending her such a beautiful voice, really tell you, the voice does wonders to me.the other actors, are equally good, raja in the title character and the little girl, and the way she shouts when she gets a new dog.ultimately, i can tell you this movie is soon on its way to be another classic with those old classic romantic ones, along with kammula's another classic-romantic piece, godavari.

roopa (kamalinee mukherjee) loses her parents and other family members in a gruesome car accident. she starts living on her own as an independent woman without taking any help from her relatives. she has a boy friend named rahul (anuj) and is about to get married to him, but backs out due to the behavior of her future mother-in-law and due to lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend. anand (raja) joins her neighborhood. and he starts making roopa feel comfortable and secure. the rest of the story is about why anand - md of the richest corporate house of ap - has chosen to reside as neighbor of roopa and what follows next.this movie has a freshness to it which we rarely see in indian movies to it. although the story goes slow, you get a sense of familiarity with it. kudos to the director shekhar kammula for such an awesome direction! brilliant music and background score composed by k.m. radhakrishnan adds to the quality. kamalini mukherjee as rupa has given a marvelous performance. i think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous looks and amazing histrionics. anand as raja has done well too. i have watched this movie thrice now and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. it is a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here. highly recommended!!

i was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in new york. it is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of september 11th. this film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit, through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days. the film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved. it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. i walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello. i would recommend everyone see this documentary. i would rate this movie with an a++++++++++. see it if you get a chance.

almost 4 years after the events of 911, if asked what comes to mind about that day, most people would probably comment on things such as the sight of planes crashing into and the collapse of the twin towers, the scores of people being killed, acts of terrorism and heroism mixed together, etc. everyone who was alive at the time will never forget that day. yet for most of us the memories, although moving, are not on a personal level. now comes an extraordinary film which gives everyone who did not lose a friend or a family member a chance to become involved at a personal level in just what we lost on 911. this is a film that needs to be seen.

a touching documentary that puts a human face on the tragedy of 9/11 by showing how one small community coalesced to honor two high school friends lost on that day. the film interweaves the lives of chris and tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos. through their reminiscences we glimpse two lives tragically cut short. the film also documents how, through a series of coincidences, an inspirational memorial garden was brought forth through the efforts of many people, both known and unknown to the two victims. through the laughter and the tears(and the sweat) we see the power of hope and honor and love. this films evokes many different emotions, but the final feeling is one of admiration of the human spirit undaunted by tragedy.

paha maa is different finnish film. but the things which makes it different are copied abroad. some techniques of narration are from amores perros, jackie brown and elephant. scenes are shot from different angles again. paha maa is a good movie, but it isn't so good that the hype tolds: "realistic movie, no happy end, and no commercial admissions." some actors did great job. sulevi peltola was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler. also jasper p√§√§kk√∂nen shows his skills. but mikko leppilampi was so lame. he is so overrated actor, he's handsome and a nice guy, but not the best actor of finland. but if you like finnish movies, paha maa is worth to see.

**spoilers** beautifully photographed slice of life home-front wwii love story with norman rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a "war hero" is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isn't corrupted by the war propaganda that's constantly drummed into his head. washing out of the marine corps marion "hedg" hedgepeth, jan michael-vincent,is kicked out of boot-camp, after five weeks, and forced to put on a baby blue marine uniform that shows that he just didn't have it to make the corps. humilitated and scorned wherever he went as he's going home to st. louis and terrified what his family, whom his dad was in the marine corps in wwi, would think of him in that he couldn't "cut the mustard" as a us marine. hedg stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a marine member of the fearless and deadly marine raiders richard gere whom a admiring hedge buys a beer. making conversation with richard hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the pacific theater after all the battles he fought in, and combat medals he got, but the totally gray hair and mid-thirty looking richard is going to be 21 next month! that's what being in the marine corps and wwii did to him! buying hedge a number of drinks richard takes the drunk baby blue outside and knocks him out taking his baby blues and leaves his impressive us marine uniform with some money in it for hedge to ware. as soon as hedge puts on richard's uniform, that fits him perfectly, he's confronted by this big drunken us paratrooper who calls himself cement-head wanting to have a fist fight with the marine raider. hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by cement-head to belt him, after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement-head, to get himself warmed up for the big bout between marine,hedge, and paratrooper, cement-head. hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch! "i guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head" a stunned hedge tell his, cement-heads, fellow g.i's.hitch-hiking to this small town of bidwell hedge notices this us military internment camp for japanese-americans who are there because their considered a threat to us security. it's later in the movie that hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is, not who the people in the town think he is, by risking his life to save one of the hated "japs" who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death japanese-american from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town. hedge in his actions taught the people of bidwell that not all "japs", even those who are american citizens, are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they were.hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner rose hudkins, glynnis o'connor,who's just crazy about him that even hedge at first thinks that it's his uniform not him that impressed her. later when hedge admits to rose that he's not what she and her parents think,a us marine raider,that he is rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed-out marine so well that it didn't matter to her at all what he was supposed to be, a marine a paratrooper or a post office worker, it was what was inside his heart that really counted.the film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between hedge and rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other.the way the film accurately, not phony baloney, shows the true feelings of average americans, back then in 1943, about the war in general and japanese in particular couldn't have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste. "baby blur marine" does it's best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero's or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during wwii as most people have now, which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill, to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place.

i was actually around 13 years old camping near the mccloud river, near shasta when this movie was being filmed. my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed vincent floating down the river. a little trivia...the scene where they pulled him out, was actually where he started his float down the river. and if the stunt man missed the netting, there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.anyway...i watched it at the time, and didn't get it. it wasn't until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it. it's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age. his movie career never really took off as expected, but of course he later found success on tv. i wish this movie was available, cause i would love to see it again.

good lord... how this ended up in our dvd player i'll never know...my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow...nevermind it's a couple of years old and in danish ( i think)... she kept looking for the english soundtrack...all in all...the film wasn't bad... good production values,better performances, and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for tidy, dark-humored fare from across the sea! the ending will make you chuckle...in fact, the whole film will. incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while...without spoiling the plot, the film's title and dvd jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going!

mickey rooney (as mi taylor) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin, where he meets 12-year-old elizabeth taylor (as velvet brown) - she adores horses, but he has a sad history with the animals. ms. taylor is enamored with mr. rooney's horse-sense; she takes him home, and gets him room and board with her family. they are supported very well by anne revere and donald crisp (as mr. and mrs. brown). butch jenkins and angela lansbury are taylor's strained siblings.the plot of "national velvet" is implausible to a fault; for example, the circumstances leading to taylor's ride in the "big race" are quite a stretch (but were likely more believable on paper). still, the characters' connection to horses, and to ms. revere's character are nicely conceived. rooney and taylor are excellent in the starring roles; there is a balance between rooney's fading "child star" and taylor's exuberant new "child star", which adds depth to their characterizations.the excellent performances of rooney and taylor are further enhanced by fine direction, photography, and editing from clarence brown, leonard smith, and robert kern. a sentimental classic. ******** national velvet (12/14/44) clarence brown ~ mickey rooney, elizabeth taylor, anne revere

it's a beautiful film.the scenes are well pictured.anne revere 's dialogs are really well written and inspiring,the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches makes it great and wonderful.mickey rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses.elizabeth taylor looks very pretty,her scenes in the film are inherently poetic,the way camera follows her and the way the music make you feel make every scene of her ethereally beautiful.this movie has great spirit and a beloved cherished classic.angela lansbury is quite amusing in her role though unrecognizable if you have seen her in role of 'm' in 'the manchurian candidate'.donald crisp has done his father's role full justice and the script provides him with ample stuff to justify his role.its a very nice film and a must watch for family and children an evergreen christmas favorite.

in my opinion, national velvet is one of the top family classic's of all time. it features mickey rooney as (mi taylor) and elizabeth taylor as (velvet brown).velvet wins a race horse, named (pie) in a raffle. she falls in love with it right away. with the help of mi, an ex-jockey, they train it to race in the grand national's. after the jockey who was scheduled to race pie backs out at the last moment, mi convinces velvet to take his place.this was a well put together motion picture. fine storyline and top notch acting. the inner play between elizabeth and mickey was magical. this is a wonderful family picture expertly directed by clarence brown. the photography is stunning. this is a movie you will enjoy for years to come.this picture is what made elizabeth taylor a household name. both mickey and elizabeth remained close after the film. they still send post cards to each other after all these many years. one side note. elizabeth loved the horse "pie" so much that the studio gave it to her.

"national velvet" tells the story of velvet brown, a young english girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious grand national horse race. the film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents.while "national velvet" is a family film that fact shouldn't deter anyone who typically views such films with derision. the film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention-addled youngsters. it even managed to land five oscar nominations, hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience.anne revere, in the part of velvet's mother, actually won an oscar for her performance. she was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old elizabeth taylor who steals the show. she is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. also on board are oscar-winner donald crisp as velvet's father, mickey rooney as former jockey mi taylor and angela lansbury (in one of her earliest film roles) as velvet's older sister.the film's lustrous technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film's two oscars. additionally, the film was nominated for its direction (by clarence brown), cinematography & art direction. the score by ten-time oscar nominee herbert stothart is also worth mentioning, though it went unnominated.all in all, "national velvet" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. i realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on.

this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child. it is good to remember it. the girl, liz taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney. the content of the film plot is good for all ages, good wills and behavior. good ethics of velvet's parents, particularly her mother is something to take into account. our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose. velvet loves the horses and racing them, and mi taylor (rooney) brought her to an international horse racing competition in england, where at the end the young velvet won, but was disqualified because of being female.

one of the enduring classics from mgm came out in the closing years of world war ii, it's the film that made young elizabeth taylor a star. she had done a few films as a child actress before national velvet, but when it came out her place in the movies was assured. ironically enough biologically she'd be growing up fast enough after national velvet was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little velvet brown who loved her jumping horse.i'm not sure of how this would work because steeplechase horses have to have confirmed bloodlines and the pi's are a subject not dealt with in national velvet. all we know is that he's a reckless and untrainable horse in the hands of reginald owen and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage, owen gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher donald crisp.at the same time as these things are happening, mickey rooney comes wandering into the lives of the brown family which consists of crisp, wife anne revere, and daughters angela lansbury, juanita quigley, and elizabeth taylor and their little brother butch jenkins. rooney is a former jockey who's now on the open road and heading for the brown family where his father was once a horse trainer for anne revere's family. it's he who sees the potential of the pi (short for pirate) as a steeplechase jumper and it's elizabeth who convinces crisp not to pass up this chance.elizabeth taylor was so sweet and innocent in national velvet. the good book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare. she infuses rooney with it, to have faith in the heart and ability of the pi and to leave a little over for himself.anne revere won a best supporting actress award for national velvet. she's a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesn't suspect. it turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the english channel and her prize money, saved all these years, she gives to her daughter. that scene is probably what won her the oscar. national velvet also won one other academy award, for film editing.over 60 years after it made its debut national velvet as a family classic hasn't lost a thing. its depiction of life between the world wars in great britain is still a standout. and national velvet launched a movie legend. can't do much better than that for high regard.

during the 13 years of schooling i had from kindergarten through high school, there was only one day that my class took a field trip. when i went to school, you went to school, from 8:30 until 3:30 and filed trips were not taken. but, for some reason i could not recall at this advanced age, we went to see a movie - national velvet. i do not recall the movie, so, on the eve of my 57th year, i decided to revisit it.it is a movie about a time that no longer exists. a time when people trusted others and didn't lock their houses. a time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. it was a time when family was the most important thing. this film shows all of that and more. it shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people.it would not be a bad thing for every family to view this film once in a while and discuss its message.it was a treat to see the young elizabeth taylor, mickey rooney at his best, the academy award-winning performance of anne revere, angela lansbury before murder, she wrote, and donald crisp, who performed for almost sixty years.what a movie!

this is the first movie i ever owned on video, and 14 years later, i still have the same copy. elizabeth taylor was as radiant at twelve as ever later in life, mickey rooney gave real dimension to mi taylor, and donald crisp was solid as ever as mr. brown. the amazing anne revere, as mrs. brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. after nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor, and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, root for the pie, and love velvet for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays. i love it as an adult just as i loved it as a child. a must for every family video collection.

my daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in...but i want to add a few words. ¬ënational velvet' was one of my two favorite movies as a child. (the other being 'the wizard of oz¬ë.) the cinematography, the acting, the script, and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes. based on a book by enid bagnold, the script followed the book quite well. the characters are so thoughtfully created. it's easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little irish village in which they live. the premise...complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world...is awe inspiring to any young person, especially a young girl in the 40's...a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes. you would have to be terribly hard-boiled not to appreciate it's merit. but the perspective i cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it's moral message.. it's almost magical how 'mom and apple pie' the movies were back then. i was really taken aback by the imdb reviewer who asked...'was the world ever really this trusting?' and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding ¬ëunchaperoned' overnight travel involving the two main characters. my answer to his question is an unequivocal yes!!!! the movie going world was that trusting in the 40's.my grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released. then my mother took me to see it when i was young, and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape. now we have it on dvd. it's been a family favorite for generations, albeit generations of horse lovers. it was never about sex...it's about coming of age! it's about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals. also, so old fashioned it wasn't even about the prize money! it's about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to ¬ëbe the best'. and yes, the director was indeed concerned with elizabeth taylor's lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about velvet brown (liz taylor's character) having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the grand national steeplechase. this was a guys only sport back then...i think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race. it's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the lolita thing about this particular movie...besides, anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail.and now for a great bit of trivia...the stunt riding was performed by the now famous ¬ëhorse whisperer', monty roberts. i believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits.i give this movie a 10 out of 10! i never get tired of watching it again.

although it has been off the air for 6 years now, promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation. good cast, supporting cast(among them, richard thomas and ossie davis) and crew. the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying "to hell with it all" after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier. i think a lot of vietnam-era veterans, myself included, could really relate to mcraney's thought process in finally deciding on his course of action. many of us did precisely the same thing in real life, after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left. the show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life. in those two respects alone, i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time. why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me.

i absolutely loved this series, and was very sad to see it go. yes, it's christian based, and traditionally as well. it deals with some tough issues, as the other reviewer points out, but i guess it depends on your viewpoint on these matters, and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother myself, i was so happy to see a tv series that was clean and, well, quite frankly, wonderful! i, unlike the other reviewer, was heartened to see how they dealt with the condom deal. instead of hearing the typical wishy washiness about condoms, they showed the son actually working at being chaste and applying it to his later relationships, which were pure and godly because of it, and a lot safer because of it (100%!).after watching this entire series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family (once they settle down more permanently), and the moral values they teach in each episode are just priceless. i found touched by an angel (made by the same producer) to be cheesy here and there (although overall i liked it), but this series, in my opinion, was a lot better made and had better acting and was more interesting as well. it was good for the entire family and was interesting for the entire family, which was a huge plus. the family wasn't outstanding, they had their own faults, but in the long run they did what was right and you saw them grow and change and struggle like any true family does. it was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list, i hope it comes out on dvd!

i saw 'i smell the dead' -- sorry, 'i sell the dead' -- at a press screening. glenn mcquaid, the film's writer-director-editor, is a laddish irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that -- whilst it was in progress -- he would be 'going out for a pint'. i don't begrudge him a drink, but -- by telling us about it -- he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his irishness, or both. when the opening credits rolled, there were -- as usual at press screenings -- loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who'd got friends in the audience, and silence for those who hadn't. mcquaid returned for a witty q&a afterwards.this horror movie doesn't take itself seriously, which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror. only one scene is even remotely scary, and most of the 'horror' is merely gross-out, but i laughed throughout much of the film.this movie appears to be set in ireland circa 1850 (by which time grave-robbing was mostly defunct). the story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks within flashbacks, and the narrating character flashbacks material that he couldn't know about, because sometimes he wasn't present or (in one case) because the action is unfolding behind his back.the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. guillotines weren't used in 19th-century ireland, but -- for once -- we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. the prisoner struggles on his way to execution, the rope cleats are accurate, and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead. (and there's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.)the characters are ostensibly irish, but one major character speaks in cockney slang: using phrases like "a mug's game" and "take a butcher's" (for 'have a look'). for once, actors in 19th-century roles display 19th-century dental hygiene, yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles (and the women's make-ups) are resolutely 21st-century. i'm not complaining in the case of heather bullock, who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be pvc. phworr!the lead actors (except ron perlman) are excellent, but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period. the worst offender is joel garland as the publican, whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century. just when i thought that garland's performance couldn't get any less victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" air-quotes.the sets (especially angus scrimm's lab) are detailed and impressive, yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places. nearly every interior contains burning candles, but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or workplaces: leftover drippings from previous candles.one scene features an extra-terrestrial: i was annoyed that mcquaid plumped for a stereotypical "grey" schwa alien, rather than something original.there are splendid montage sequences, but mcquaid opts for flashy effects -- split-screens, overhead shots -- that don't serve the story. i was impressed by a recurring blue-screen device superimposing the main characters' heads over other backgrounds. less effective was a recurring 'creepshow'-style motif of camera shots morphing actors' faces into drawings resembling panel art from 1950s ec horror comics. i'm a fan of ec comics, but they don't belong in 19th-century ireland. the money that mcquaid spent on flashy photo f/x -- showing off his editing skills without serving the story -- should've been spent on accurate costumes.big spoilers now. ron perlman gives an "oirish" performance full of acting-school tics. ostensibly playing a 19th-century irish priest, he writes with his left hand. (in victorian ireland, left-handed children were punished for using "the devil's hand" and were forcibly retrained to become righties.) but perlman's character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand. elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects, so i knew there'd be a payoff later. several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight, apparently only because this was easier and less expensive. (since mcquaid is a proficient director and editor, he could easily have shot "day for night" ... but using a process-photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques.)mcquaid seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks. but those hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 whitechapel, or wherever. 'i sell the dead' almost entirely fails to evoke the 19th century.glenn mcquaid shows talent as a director, scripter and editor, yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices ... then largely fails to justify those choices. but i enjoyed 'i sell the dead'. i'll rate it 7 out of 10, and i look forward to his next movie.

grave robber is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk wishing to take down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the horrible life he lead. at first reluctant, but with his tongue loosened up by drink the young grave robber is soon telling his story which is full of the dead, the undead and things that go bump in the night. new york lensed horror film (filmed in part on staten island which no doubt brought the spirit of andy milligan lurking about) is one of the better horror comedies to come around in a while. this is an often very funny film that just spins its story out in every which way. the cast is first rate. dominic monaghan plays arthur blake the grave robber telling his story. ron perlman is father duffy the monk taking the statement and perhaps getting too involved in the tale. both men are clearly having a grand old time and it shows. the rest of the cast is equally as good. the music by jeff grace is excellent. the effects are perfect for this sort of ghoulish silliness. the film is a great deal of fun. if there is any trouble with the film its that perhaps it throws its net a little wide so as the result has way too much going on. i don't want to give too much away but i don't think we needed the alien body in the mix. still this is a great deal of fun and its one i'm pretty sure i will revisit on the ifc in theaters where i saw it the first time, and later on i'm sure i'll pick up the dvd.worth a look.

i sell the dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. this has advantages and drawbacks. the 85 minutes of the film breeze by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes gory, occasionally all three at once, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the film's parts.the story, such as it is, follows professional grave robber arthur blake (played by dominic monaghan). arthur's partner-in-crime willie grimes (larry fessenden) has just had his head chopped off for murder and arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeit for the same crime. arthur insists that he is innocent of murder, but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when bribed with irish whisky by a catholic priest (played by ron perlman).since the movie is a series of grave-robbing anecdotes confessed by arthur, it becomes a sort of horror anthology - a series of disjointed tales, all linked by a similar cast (arthur and willie) and a similar theme (grave robbing). like most horror anthologies, there is no consistent mythology, because all mythologies are true and happening simultaneously even when they contradict one another.it probably didn't help that i saw this film the same night as trick 'r treat, a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that i sell the dead falls into. in fact, trick 'r treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified, consistent story than i sell the dead which is intended to be a united narrative.the other problem with the film (and i recognize that this is insane nit-picking) is the way the film plays fast and loose with history. grimes is killed with a guillotine. we might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a scottish maiden, a precursor to the french guillotine, but the scottish maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set a good hundred years later since burke and hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829. grave robbing as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the anatomy act (1832) so the film must take place before then.i know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy off of. and it's not like the history of grave robbers or body snatchers or resurrectionists (call it what you like) is a boring story.the most frustrating thing is that writer.director glenn mcquaid clearly does know the history, especially the good bits. as an example, when grimes first takes on arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to arthur that as resurrectionists, they don't steal the clothes from the dead, because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor, punishable by a small fine, while stealing clothes is a felony, punishable by deportation or possibly even death. so you would expect wille and arthur to strip the corpse at this point (and for the rest of the film) but of course they don't. you could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script, but not when the writer and the director are the same person.my point isn't that there should have been a lot of buck-naked corpses in the film, my point is that if you are going to bring up this quirk in the law and make it clear that willie and arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is, than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion, even if that means that willie and arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and stuffing them back in the empty coffin, so that they don't get deported for stealing the walking corpse's clothes, otherwise don't bring up the matter at all.historical nerdiness aside, i sell the dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more.

this movie was very funny with just a bit of gore. it is about two grave robber that are going about business as usual when they discover that there is a different client√®le they can serve. this changes the direction of the corpses they collect. the movie is told by the younger of the two as he is explaining the business to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded. his partner had already been beheaded. the priest is required to take down the last confession and it takes the form of a story. there is some animation thrown in which gives it a tales from the crypt feel. in the story we meet another group of grave robbers that everyone fears, but at one point, the younger of the two up for execution is offered a job, so this calms some of the animosity between the groups. when a woman joins the two men, she oversteps her boundaries and gets them in trouble with the feared grave robbers. the story leads up to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man that is confessing and the man that has already lost his head.

i sell the dead (2009) **1/2 dominic monaghan, larry fessenden, ron perlman, angus scrimm, john speredakos, eileen colgan, brenda cooney. uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the '60s horror films by roger corman and hammer studios, with two cretinous grave robbers (monaghan and fessenden) facing final punishments for the crimes via the guillotine but not before their tales of the occult can be recalled in flashbacks. amusing and a few well sprinkled jolts but really a mess of a b-movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets perlman and scrimm to no avail; a good rental for halloween. (dir: glenn mcquaid)

it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks. this is a great horror-spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances. its laughs are subtle, but plentiful. because there is very little if any cgi, there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects. this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera-man-must-be-sh%#@ing-his-pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so.far more enjoyable than the big-budget re-made garbage being released by hollywood today.see it.

i saw this at the san francisco independent film festival and liked it a lot. it worked for me as a slightly weird comedy, because i don't like horror, but there were only a couple of minutes i had to close my eyes.the dialog was good, the costumes and settings were not far off bbc-quality, which is amazing for an indie film. i liked the way the plot twists and even meanders, it kept surprising me in good ways. i even warmed up to the willy grimes character, who i quite disliked at the beginning. it would have been better if there'd been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: that felt very much like a plot device.i am fond of dominic monaghan, and he did a good job at pratfalls, horror, and at the more thoughtful moments. nice voice in the narration, too.this would be a fun and unusual date movie.

ok. finally, a horror film that's done well. as soon as i heard the music, i knew that some effort had been made in creating what i consider to be an almost masterpiece of good ol'horror. zombies, whores, booze, grave snatching and a lot more. a great cast, well acted, well directed, well written---there was hardly a flaw. even the american actors with irish/english accents really pulled it off. i thought that the actor larry fessenden looked familiar to me. it was that missing tooth. finally i realized that this guy was the lead in "habit" a film about vampires in nyc. i thought he was excellent in that role. now i'm wondering if he's an american or not. his accent was so convincing in "i sell," that i thought he had to have grown up in the emerald isle, not in the us. well apparently he's a born and raised new yorker. a great actor--really made the role his own in this movie. nothing beats a horror flick set in early 19th century europe (like the old hammer flicks.) i encourage anyone that wants to have a great time to watch this well crafted movie.

when people harp on about how "they don't make 'em like they used to" then just point them towards this fantastically entertaining, and quaint-looking, comedy horror from writer-director glenn mcquaid.it's a tale of graverobbers (played by dominic monaghan and larry fessenden) who end up digging up more than just silent, immobile corpses. after the initial shock of this they soon realise that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage. and that's just what they try to do. mind you, it seems as if things may not have worked out quite as they planned as poor young arthur (monaghan) is actually relating his tale to a priest (ron perlman) before being taken to the gallows.looking at the detail of his filmography, mcquaid seems to have taken the core of his first, short movie and expanded it to this feature effort, which is no bad thing. fessenden returns and does well, monaghan is one of those guys who can actually still get you to like him while he goes about the nefarious business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favourites such as perlman and angus scrimm on the scene this film is a lot of fun for genre fans.it also benefits from a unique and favourable design and look, at times moving from e.c. comic-style panels into live action (a la creepshow) and always somehow feeling quite authentic in it's hammer horror feel. maybe everything is just covered over with so much dry ice but that's beside the point. whatever was done to capture everything on film, it works. it works well.it may not have any actual scares but this film does have a great vein of black humour and definitely soaks every minute of it's runtime in macabre material that should please all of those who have the patience for horror that's a little bit more sedate and feels like it definitely could have been made back in the days of hammer.see this if you like: the flesh and the fiends, the doctor and the devils, creepshow.

this movie was fun, if all over the board.it essentially follows the comedic romp of two grave-robbers in 19th century england, who move from conventional body snatching to trafficking in vampires, zombies and dead roswell aliens. (i have no idea what the roswell alien was doing in there, and neither did the producers, i think.) but was it funny? you bet. even ron perlman, who is often the kiss of direct to dvd death was pretty good in this one as a priest who turns out to be the ringleader of a rival gang of body-snatchers.a real joy to watch this hilarious little film, and a good example of what you can do when you don't have larger than life egos on either side of the camera.

(note: i saw i sell the dead at the glasgow international film festival on 20th january 2009.) i sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy set in late medieval times, and stars dominic monaghan (lost, lord of the rings), ron pearlman (hellboy), larry fessenden (session 9) and angus scrimm (phantasm).the movie opens with grave-robber willie grimes (fessenden), still indignant and unremorseful, being dragged to the guillotine and executed. his apprentice and partner-in-crime arthur blake (monaghan) is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when father duffy (perlman), a whiskey-swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult, pays him a visit with the apparent intention of recording blake's final confession. it soon becomes apparent, however, that duffy main interest lies in the more... otherworldly side of blake's exploits. most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as monaghan regails duffy with tales of his macabre career.initially, grimes and blake start out as simple wise-cracking body snatchers, working in the employ of the ghoulish dr quint (scrimm), a callous, corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as leverage over our two anti-heroes, and takes a rather unhealthy relish in his work. the pair have their first run-in with the undead when, one evening, quint sends them on a mission to a bleak moonlit moor to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously interred at a crossroads, apparently according to some ancient custom. but there's something different about this corpse. this one has been wrapped in cloves of garlic... and buried with a stake through it's heart...following a terrifying encounter, not only do they devise a plan to rid themselves of the scheming doctor's machinations, but they also uncover a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses, and even better money for living specimens of the undead. this leads our intrepid duo into the hidden underworld of the "ghoul hunting" trade, where they find themselves going head-to-head not only with vampires, monsters and zombies (and one other paranormal entity for which i will not spoil the surprise), but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inbred and murderous murphy clan.i went into i sell the dead expecting a low-key, mildly distracting, low budget chiller. i was not prepared for the incredible imagination, giddy humour, quality acting, great dialogue, thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes i sell the dead a strong early contender for my horror film of the year.with the exception of a couple of rough edges, the production values are truly fantastic for such a low budget flick - it looks like it was made for about $20 million, and i was surprised when the director told the audience it was made for significantly less than half of that (although he was unwilling to give exact figures as the film was still being sold to distributors). the "look" and tone of the film is a visual comic book somewhere between tim burton and hammer horror, with smart little creepshow-esquire artwork inserts. the plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of a hidden underworld, running parallel to everyday life but which the general populace is either unable or unwilling to believe in, is one that actually makes quite good sense within the context of the film.the acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch. the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly grimes and blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic. angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn.conclusion - i loved it. it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie. i struggle to find anything bad to say about it. mark my words, this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.

if you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one. if you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off- then this isn't the one for you.for the budget that this movie was filmed on, the music was particularly amazing! even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!the story was truly well done and the director is to be commended. there is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! the acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which i am definitely holding out for! i have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic.in a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave-robber. it tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters. vampires to zombies and even aliens! our stars start out as simple grave-robbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor (angus scrim) who requires bodies for his medical practise. when the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the grave-robbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies. the only problem is that there is another gang called the house of murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses- and thats where both grave-robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences.this movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that i have seen in years and reminds me of the evil dead. don't miss this one, you will regret it!

this film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of hollywood crap i've seen recently. the acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing. there really isn't much to the story, it's simple and it works well. an easy film to just sit down and enjoy. the mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals. the film obviously has aspects of horror, yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things. you won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one, but you'll be smiling the whole way through. the humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt. i really watched this movie based on the fact that ron perlman was in it. his role is a bit smaller than i expected, but it doesn't matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged. if you like horror, watch this. if you like comedies, watch this. just go ahead and watch this anyway, it's really quite excellent.

i just saw this at siff, and i absolutely loved it. there were parts where i laughed so hard i couldn't catch my breath. the script and direction by glenn mcquaid are fantastic. i can't wait to see more from this talented young man. the performances make the movie. larry fessenden and dominic monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber willy and his apprentice arthur. ron perlman turns in a fantastic performance (as usual) as a less-than-sympathetic jailhouse priest. bonus: angus scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! as always, he balances menace and humor perfectly.this is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since vincent price did "comedy of terrors," "the raven," and "theater of blood." the movie is genuinely scary in places, then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. some parts are scary and funny at the same time.i can only afford to see three movies at siff this year, but even if the other two are awful, "i sell the dead" was worth the price of all three. i'm going to be looking for more movies from larry fessenden's glass eye pix. he's giving the horror genre a much-needed kick in the butt.

i sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber arthur blake. blake's friend and fellow grave robber willie grimes has just been executed and blake is going to follow suit the next morning. while he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named father duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber. he then proceeds to give father duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exploits.the plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by chronology. this prevents the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it much. though flawed, i thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining. most of the various stories are good, specifically the alien, the murphy's and the vampire, but others weren't so great.the acting isn't amazing but i didn't find it bad at any point. dominic monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well into the comedic parts of the film.the characters were not extremely in-depth, but they were all interesting. i also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a over-the-top almost comic book manner. the part with the back story of the murphy's and their gang is priceless.so overall, i sell the dead very successfully combines horror, comedy and sci-fi into a mish mash of fun and excitement. it is one of the more interesting and original movies i have seen in a while, and it's unfortunate that independent films like this don't get more recognition.

i went to see glenn mcquaid's "i sell the dead" in it's north american premiere at the toronto after dark film festival. seeing as this is the second showing worldwide i didn't quite know what to expect of this film, especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation.i'll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis, without giving away any spoilers.this movie is about arthur blake, how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered.the costume and set design in this film were excellent. i was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around new york. the costumes were very accurate to the time, really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time. this movie works just as well as a period-piece as it does a horror-comedy.the interaction between the two leads was very fluid. they played off each others acting with ease. the dialogue between the two was very well written, with glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations.the story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start. i'd compare it to a visual page turner, always wondering just what will happen next. the characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself.all in all, i recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour, with a bit of horror mixed in.9/10

i saw this movie as part of the midnite madness at sitges. set in 18th century england, the plot covers the life of arthur blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his execution.the plot moves along via a series of misadventures involving arthur and his partner encountering various unsavory characters and bizarre situations.the first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the hammer period horrors, the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards, rowdy tavern scenes and excellent set/costume design.for a movie titled i sell the dead, i was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror ¬ñ don't get me wrong there are some jumpy moments and gore, but the tone is very much comedic, driven by the situations the characters get themselves into and their dialog. the closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads (larry fessenden and dominic monaghan) is the character interaction seen in the classic english comedies only fools and horses, the two ronnies and morecambe and wise.the acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in ron perlman and angus scrimm lift the movie above many of the others on view in sitges.overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face.

first of all this was not a three hour movie - two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi. i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing. everything here no one really needed to know. this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. but it was made and the reason is because lucy & desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars. that is definitely so not true and very, very sad.anyway, what was shown here in lucy was pretty good. two complaints - the actress who played viv vance - not great casting at all. and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york.... uhhh, like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? that wasn't too great. but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy & desi. no, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said, this focused mainly just on lucy & desi. had there been more time, had the story been more about lucy's entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable & lombard, red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead. wow, that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool: his presence and influence in lucy's life. really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. oh well. what was explored was done well, for the most part. honestly, i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this movie'll be that memorable. for someone who digs i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. my grade for this: b

before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. after watching it, i realized how sad lucille ball's life really was. it had it's great moments too, but i didn't realize how sad it was. this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well. i highly reccommend it.

dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary in retelling any life story. in the case of "lucy", the main points of lucille ball's teenage years, early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way.the main emotional points of lucy's life are made clear: lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz; lucy & desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv's most memorable sitcom couple.as lucille ball, rachel york does a commendable job. do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland, but york makes ball strong-willed yet likable, and is very funny in her own right. even though her comedic-timing is different than lucy's, she is still believable. the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set, and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early "i love lucy" years, but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was, but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi's accent, especially in the opening scene. madeline zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen-aged lucy.vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much, thankfully, since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles. not that they aren't good actors in their own right, they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland, and the repressed accents are detectable at times.although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. jess oppenheimer, the head writer of lucy's radio show "my favourite husband" which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with "i love lucy" in 1951, completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main "i love lucy" director for its entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season! also, though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the ricardo's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. the kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well. the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original, except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. there's also desi talking about buying rko in 1953, during lucy's red-scare incident, even though rko did not hit the market until 1957. these changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher, two vital figures in "i love lucy" history? the biggest gaff comes in the "i love lucy" recreation scenes, at least a few of them. it's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when obvious changes are made. the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated, and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! the "we're having a baby" number was shortened as well, but other than that it was practically dead on. by far the best was the "grape-stomping" scene, with rachel york really nailing lucy's mannerisms. the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the "vitametavegamin" and candy factory bits, instead showing the actors rehearse them. these scenes proved effective because of that approach.the film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy's life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. overall, though, it gives a decent portrait of lucy & desi's marriage, and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.

i thought rachel york was fantastic as "lucy." i have seen her in "kiss me, kate" and "victor/victoria," as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in "lucy." even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy. my response to that is, "so what?" i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy. i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. and rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. i also didn't want to see someone simply "doing" classic lucy routines. therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory. (it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of "i love lucy" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. "lucy" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy.

this is speculation. this movie could of inspired paramount pictures to film the movie the core. both movies have something in common nature.the only improvement for inferno is a better cast. inferno's cast is still good though. excellent movie 8 out of 10. this is worth watching. this movie does have truth to it heat waves are real. another piece of truth is heat related power outages. where i live i have actually heard transformers blow. unrest from heat is possible because people seeking to cool off may get rowdy. there is a considerable amount of team work in this movie. again this a movie worth watching. the movie has a good cast. the movie has no slow spots.

inferno gives los angeles what it deserves-- a baptism in fire, death from above. an excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat out the passing of the coronal mass ejection but that would be no fun and certainly not dramatic. a really lame review in variety criticized the characters for being concerned with their personal redemption instead of banning together to save the world. but what's refreshing about this big heat is that there's nothing anyone can do about it. we are, therefore, mercifully not subjected to "heart warming" scenes of fascist presidents and other big blowhard statists as they contrive implausible plots to save a chosen remnant of mankind (ala deep impact). here the sweat drenched and lust-powered dirty half dozen work out their own redemption or face their personal oblivions the old fashioned way-- together as individuals or......alone with the alone. excellent tv film all in all. clearly not denatured by the destructive meddlesomness of overzealous network execs. i highly recommend.

kingdom county, vermont, 1927. noel lord (rip torn) lives with his indian mate, bangor (tantoo cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built; noel, however, is not willing to give up on his land, and he'll have to fight the dam company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction."where the rivers flow north" is a gripping, contemplative story powered by the memorable performances of rip torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of louis xv in sofia coppola's underrated "marie antoinette") and tantoo cardinal ("dances with wolves", "smoke signals"). director jay craven (who also co-wrote the script with don bredes, based on howard frank mosher's novel) and cinematographer paul ryan crafted this powerful story with unique, contemplative pace/visuals, which remind me of terrence malick's and john huston's best moments. it's an underrated independent period piece of the first (electric) half of the 90's, usually regarded as the rise of quentin tarantino's burlesque ("pulp fiction" is a masterpiece indeed, but the man suffers from orson welles' syndrome), todd solondz's disturbing suburbia, danny boyle's dark vision of the uk (let's not mention that "beach" flick with dicaprio, though)... jay craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well. he's been leading a respectful, discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his.my vote: 8/10.

where the rivers flow north is a well-told story about two peoples' fight to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. besides enjoying the movie as entertainment, i also learned quite a bit about life in rural new england back in the late 1920s.the cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern vermont and set the stage, while the music brought the movie to life. very well done for a low-budget, locally-produced film. i found michael j. fox's character the weakest in the film, but rip torn and tantoo cardinal turn in two of the finest performances i've seen in a long time. i was saddened she did not get a nod as best actress that year (i assume the film was too "small" a film to be considered).

i'm not sure how the imdb "weighted average" came up with such a low rating on this film. it is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie. rip torn is fantastic as the stubborn noel lord, and tantoo cardinal superlative as his housemate. torn and cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on.their relationship isn't always pleasant, but it's very real. this is not the "humerous and touching love story" it's billed as on the dvd jacket. in the end it is a tragedy. lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move.the music is fantastic, as are the period sets.

jay craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film. first off, the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all of the gloomy beauty of northern new england in late autumn (cinematographer paul ryan did 2nd unit on malick's days of heaven). second, the performances are uniformly excellent - rip torn's noel lourdes is irascibly charming and tantoo cardinal's bangor is at once sensitive and exuberant, to say nothing of a fine supporting cast. overall though, it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, natural and genuine, that nevertheless does not seem expected. this is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between humans and history.

director jay craven's adaptation of howard frank mosher's 'where the rivers flow north' is one of the finer transitions from literature to the screen. craven is an admirer of mosher's work -- he also directed 'a stranger in the kingdom'.the cast is superb -- especially rip torn and tantoo cardinal. torn offers what could be the finest role of his career -- noel lord, the fiercely independent former lumberjack who is at the center of this story. tantoo cardinal's portrayal of lord's live-in housekeeper/common-law wife is dead-on as well. i'm both amazed and disappointed that neither of them were nominated for oscars when this film was released. performances of this calibre should be acknowledged. the only character that's a little hard to swallow for me is the power company executive played by michael j. fox. he just looks too much like a kid in this role. i guess there's a curse attached to youthful looks, no matter how much people want them.craven has done a nice job here in bringing the character of early 20th century vermont to the screen -- locations, angles, sets, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. cinematographer paul ryan was exceptional. the score by the horseflies is also first rate -- it fits the mood and scenery perfectly.and the story itself...? one of the most compelling portrayals of the fiercely independent american pioneer spirit ever -- a trait that is on the wane in this day and age. when it appears in modern times, the person is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain. in noel lord, we have a character whom we can admire for his values, and even for his stubbornness.this is not a stodgy 'period piece', but a vibrant look at an era that is gone, and a type of character that has all but vanished. these are not gold-plated heroes, but real people, with both strengths and weaknesses at play within them. struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live. like today, there are those who wield power that would have it otherwise.

this is a fine, under-rated film and rip torn, well-known as he is, is a seriously under-rated actor. i read howard frank mosher's novel many years ago. how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermont's northeast kingdom! i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the "irasburg incident" took place. i've not seen _stranger in the kingdom_, the craven/mosher collaboration based on the incident(and another mosher novel), but this film has inspired me to track it down.

outstanding performance by tantoo cardinal. she carries this movie alone. rip torn is great but just a shadow to tantoo. a bitter sweet story of a woman who loves a very stubborn man. beautiful, funny, sad, touching, a must see film.

i saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago. compared to the made for lifetime movies i usually watched, it became an instant though obscure favorite.i've seen it maybe twice since then. i think some parts are little cheesy, maybe the plot could use some more action.nevertheless, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. the magical realism is on par with that of amelie, and the heart with that of the wonder years. despite the particular development of my tastes, i still find the subtle magic of this film, the lovable characters, and its simplicity enchanting.

i highly reccommend this movie. it blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed. the actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance. i loved the story line, the actors, everything. while i do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes, over-all the movie was impeccably done.

if there's one theme of this film, it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination. this family is poor, their father works graveyard, and their mother works double-shifts, and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons, and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change, and thinks like your appearance start to matter. the backdrop of this story is the 1967 world's fair and the centennial of canada. the film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope. watch the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with, and then for some reason, lost, you'll really like this film. perhaps kids will like this film, but only adults will truly appreciate it, including its references to bolshevik's and what parent's will do for their children.

ok i know the original ghoulies aren't in this entry it even seems it doesn't belong in this series. but it still iz a good movie. it is hilarious i thought especially with the pepper spray or mace. i give it a 9

the lovely, yet lethal alexandra (stunning statuesque blonde beauty stacie randall, who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master faust can cross over into our dimension. it's up to fearless, rugged cop jonathan graves (likable peter liapis) to stop her. meanwhile, two pitifully unfunny "comic relief" dwarf gnome creatures run amok in los angeles. seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously. the cast struggle gamely with the silly material: the adorable barbara alyn woods as sassy, fetching police captain kate, raquel krelle as tart, sexy hooker jeanine, bobby di cicco as graves' bumbling, excitable partner scotty, peggy trentini as alluring museum curator monica, and ace mask as the jolly dr. rochelle. mark stevi's puerile cookie cutter script, an amusingly lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, chuck cirino's bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks, j.e. bash's plain cinematography, no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of, and the tacky (less than) special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid velveeta. an entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.

okay, so ghoulies 4 is kind of bad. and it doesn't really even have the ghoulies in it. and the acting is bad. the storyline is stupid. but i forget to mention how funny this film is. it is so campy, and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy. there are only 2 ghoulies in the movie, and they don't really seem to be in relation with the ghoulies in the other film. but they are pretty funny. and funny thing, that jonathon graves returns for this one. if you saw the first, he was a character in that. in my opinion, this is better than the first. there are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one which is in a grocery store. "attention k-mart shoppers!" watch this if you enjoy bad movies. it's so bad it is good. and did i mention barbara alyn woods is hot?

sixth (and last) movie in the boxset. well, looks like i've saved the best one for last. ghoulies iv. i originally did a review for this back in like february, but i decided to do a new one. the ghoulies series is pretty awesome. i know there are some people who don't like them, and that's fine. this happens to be my favorite one in the series. yeah, i know the actual ghoulies don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of them being tony cox from bad santa. now, onto the movie.the movie centers around jonathan graves, the main character from the first movie, being played once again, by peter liapis, who is now a cop for the lapd and has put his past of the occult behind him. during the first part of the movie, we encounter alexandra (played by the very hot stacie randall) communicating with a demon from beyond named faust, who is the dark side of jonathan. faust asks alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry, therefore, unleashing the ghoulies from the beyond.i think jim wynorski did a good job with the directing. and the music by chuck cirino is funny as well. (spoiler ahead) at the end of this movie, the ghoulies say that there will be a ghoulies iv, part 2, or ghoulies v. i still hope that sequel gets made and i especially hope jim wynorski returns to direct. i agree with gimbotheghoulies on that.

as a sci-fi movies fan i also like alien. but pitch black is definitely better than alien 3 and alien: resurrection. it maches well into alien series. but it isn't alien, it's something else. ok, enough comparisons. this movie but me think: why people are afraid of dark. you can't run away from dark. it's impossible. you have to be faced with darkness and with that, what's in dark. in this movie i also liked that the vin diesel character richard b. riddick wasn't typical good-boy. he had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past. to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all. first of all he want to get out of that planet himself. there is also other metaphors in this story. every big sci-fi fan should see this picture.

i really enjoyed this movie. it was edgy without being sociopath. vin diesel brought the riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels.i also saw iron giant and vin is perfect. (the snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called "triple-x," or "xxx" - was a weak example of his work.) in pitch black he plays an anti-hero to the max. i don't think you can go wrong when vin stars in a movie. unfortunately, hollowood might type cast him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! i think the script for "xxx" was weak for which vin couldn't act down to it.anyway, pitch black is a great scifi - see it!-zafoid

this film gets off to a bad start. an incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. hell, half of them don't even speak english, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. you feel as if you were watching "deep blue sea" meets "silence of the lambs", minus the good bits. and unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be "crashed on a desert planet with hannibal lecter" during the daylight scenes. vin diesel is a great actor - but he is no anthony hopkins, and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. there is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so...but then things take a turn. i can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. it also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and vin diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer. by the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. by the time night falls, it is great. thrilling, horrifying and exciting. and even the character development of most main characters is well-done. if you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some great entertainment. besides, the visuals are eye-candy, and i honestly admit: i love the colour and the tone of this movie. 7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only....)

"pitch black" was a complete shock to me when i first saw it back in 2000. in the previous years, i was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (ex: starship troopers) and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different. but to plainly put it: this movie freaked me out... in a good way. i wasn't aware that i was still afraid of the dark till i watched this movie; i must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when i was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there.the alien creatures sent shivers up my spine; the individual(s) who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. i loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion.riddick's (vin diesel) gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping. at first, you figure him out to be a coldly intelligent villain but in some brief moments, you can see something humane behind his animal side. but as soon you discover it, he does something maliciously devious. he certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end. i didn't know whether to despise or admire him... he's definitely a love/hate type of character.johns (cole hauser) was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed, shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive. john's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as devious as riddick.fry (radha mitchell) is a character who, as johns so nicely expressed, looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences. but what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance, even while endangering her life when others discarded all human values and went for the dark hills running.jack (rhiana griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in riddick; through a child's eye, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. i thought it was absolutely priceless when jack shaves his head in ode to riddick; you know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery.imam (keith david), like jack, has the ability to see good in any evil. he uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships that he meets and when time permits, he rationally grieves his losses and then soldiers on. in a way, he served as a morale booster for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening.the casting for this movie was positively perfect. each actor shined brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on-screen.this movie may have had a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects do all the work for them. this movie is a definite sci-fi classic. watch it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. it will be well worth it.

our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed "the guardian". kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake. after seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the uscg helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u. s. coast guard.the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue.i feel the movie could have been made without the "hollywood" bar scene (when you see the movie, you might agree) since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior. very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. thank you, u. s. coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers, "so others may live". i'd highly recommend this movie to everyone.

let me waste a moment of your time to explain how i approached this film. 1st i dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of aliens, which i consider to be one of the weakest films in the alien series. stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after i heard positive things about it from people whose opinions i trust, i missed the theatrical run completely. i then became hooked on farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found pitch black on cable one night around bed time - so i said "oh why not, at least it has claudia black in it." soon, i recognized keith david, and began to realize that vin diesel, radha mitchell and cole hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, i do not know). i was captivated. i have now remained captivated for four years. i just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and i still love it.this is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. sound to good to be true? don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.the film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic vin diesel, introducing the character of richard riddick. diesel would go on to star in the somewhat riddick-ulous chronicles thereof (which i also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. checking out the dvd version of pitch black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.the film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. the new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (diesel). is that all? of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.as unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, pitch black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.

this movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns. among the passengers is convicted serial killer, richard riddick (vin diesel), and his nemesis, johns (cole hauser). while the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings, an eclipse of all three suns happens. shortly afterwards, scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one. during the eclipse, riddick comes into his own, as his eyeballs have been surgically shined, giving him night vision. the crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety.this is a very stylish film, with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange look. vin diesel is brilliant as riddick, truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat. there is also an underlying humour in his performance as well, which adds another dimension to the character. this is the sort of role that vin excels in, the anti-hero, whos character is not as one-dimensional as first appears. i can imagine no-one else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him.roll on chronicles of riddick!

this is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film i've seen in years! the plot seen in print is almost banal- a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and each other, then darkness falls and the monsters appear. pilot fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers, takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship - he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark. but it's really not that simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.the performances are uniformly superb - radha mitchell shows fry steeling herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while cole hauser, as the man taking riddick back to custody, shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. but the film belongs to vin diesel as riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence i've seen in years. for much of the film his face is in shadow, and he doesn't actually say a great deal, but he draws your attention all the same. sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking - or by not moving. and diesel doesn't trivialise the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a "heart of gold" - riddick is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship - he just lets us glimpse those first tentative steps from caring only for the self to caring for others.technically the film is very good. the lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness. special effects showing both riddick's and the monsters' points of view add to the suspense, as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening). editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times - there is literally no padding in this film, no fades, no time to re-orient yourself.from the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you. every scene, every line of dialogue, every single camera shot is important. see it three times to understand it all.my only caveat is about the science - the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not vice versa). however, that doesn't affect the human story, so i haven't taken points off for it.

as a zombie fan, i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! pb is also an excellent tie-in to chronicles of riddick (cor). the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. there are so many metaphors in the story! riddick is this bad guy, but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. the muslim guy, imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers, but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. overall, i recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. you won't be disappointed.

i must say that i didn't expect much sitting down to watch "pitch black," but i got a lot back, in terms of excitement and pure fun. it's the type of flick where you can just lean back, relax, and have a great time just being entertained. this isn't a deep film by any means. everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as "alien," "predator" or such. but when i watch a rip-off, i want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. it opens with a galaxy of stars. some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene - "2001," "star wars," "alien," "predator." a ship is cruising through space when inside the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awoken. the ship has been hit by something. they crash land on a nasty little planet with three suns. everyone flocks out of the ship when they find that their prisoner transport, richard riddick (vin diesel), has escaped confinement. they scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him, but they have no way of getting their ship to fly again. they search the planet for water and civilization but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not too long ago.then they find out that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black. there also happen to be hoards of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet - what are the chances? they happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens - what are the chances? and riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances?there seems to be a lot of coincedence in this movie, but a film like this isn't out to get oscars for originality or believability. it's there to entertain the audience - it does so with ease. vin diesel is a big gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever. but i've got to say if there's anyone who can fit the part of a trashy, homicidal felon it is diesel. listen to him mutter, "he did not know who he was fu**ing with." great stuff.the aliens in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks, those from "alien" and predators. they've got long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the quick-moving agility of the aliens, and the stealth of a predator. i assume david twohy (director and writer of the movie) didn't expect audiences to believe his creatures were truly something never seen before. at least i hope not."aliens redux" might be a better name for this movie, but then again, it is better than both the second and third "alien" films put together. in a time when apparently ended series are getting revived - "terminator 3," "alien 5," "predator 3," "alien vs. predator" - "pitch black" stands out as a new series altogether. two more sequels are planned. let's just hope they don't get carried away. i can just picture it twenty-five years from now: "aliens vs. predator vs. pitch black aliens: *the fight of the year."*fight of the year title may be shared with the upcoming film "freddy vs. jason vs. michael vs. leatherface vs. norman bates vs. alien vs. predator vs. terminator vs. james cameron vs. barny the dinosaur."4/5.

the opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible. i've seen a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and i looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly, "sensory overload." the plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to "subtly" explain it. the creatures in this movie are also very interesting. you don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through. overall, a very entertaining movie.

pitch black is a survival story. it's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. the task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group.the plot of pitch black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. but what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well-written characters.the group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: jack, a boy with a secret; fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; johns, a bounty- hunter with a drug-habit; imam, a holy man facing the fact that god is sometimes cruel and riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. characters start to live in the movie. they aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. you start to care for the characters, especially for riddick though that feels quite odd. he is supposed to be the bad guy. in this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. all characters are familiar with both.other thing that works in this movie is the casting. rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. radha mitchell is suitable for fry. cole hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for johns. but the most impressive work is done by vin diesel. he does great job as riddick. in his hands riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be.so, how do you survive in pitch black? keep your friends close and enemies even closer.

from the first 10 seconds of pitch black i was hooked. i had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. instead i found a highly entertaining, on the edge of your seat, thought provoking action film. the movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick. the actors are amazing, radah mitchell (high art, love and other..) as fry is truly a joy to watch on screen, while vin diesel as riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.the look of the movie is breath taking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing. followed by the complete darkness of nightfall. i would truly recommend any lover of the alien movies or radha mitchell (which is why i went to see it) to check out this film. i'm sure by the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way.

while most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'aliens' series, pitch black stands as a fine piece of sci-fi, and an excellent movie all around. perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting. this movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to. vin diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal. after all, the film is about riddick's (diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully vin doesn't drop the ball. the remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous claudia black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms. pitch black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget. the special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'. it's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of science fiction.

i'm 15, usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies. but this is one of my favorites. i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. it's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time, music is great, storyline is ok,choreography is great, must see it. i don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. not many people like this movie, but i love classic love movies, they're so much better than movies now! this movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. i haven't seen dirty dancing 2 harvana nights(prequel), prequel should have star the original actors, thats what i hate about prequels, they ruin the original. no one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. many people will agree that for a movie- the original, sequel and the 3rd one is enough. beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it. who remembers the movie about the st benard beethoven? i think there's 5 movies altogether.

i have watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and each time i watch it i am drawn into the movie and back to 1963! the movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time i watch it.i think the important thing to say here is i was 15 in 1963 and i can remember "before president kennedy was shot and before the beetles came." i can feel myself saying something like, "i carried a watermelon." and then realizing just how stupid that was! jennifer grey plays frances "baby" houseman in dirty dancing. baby is going to start college in the fall. she goes to kellerman's for vacation with her family (mom, dad and sister lisa).one of the staff dancers, penny (played by cynthia rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the college boys played by max cantor) and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and johnny (patrick swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel.thus, the need for a fill-in dancer for penny. johnny is persuaded by penny and his cousin billy (neal jones) that he can teach baby to do the dance in time for the show. baby learning the dance steps with penny and johnny are wonderful scenes!baby's father (doctor jake houseman played by jerry orbach) comes to penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. dirty dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers. around this time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.lonnie price plays a great conceited grandson (neil kellerman) to jack weston's max kellerman. jane brucker does a great job as baby's annoying sister lisa houseman.the music is great and the dancing is wonderful! the "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - i can feel baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, "where'd they learn to do that?".jennifer grey and patrick swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. patrick's song, "she's like the wind" brings tears to my eyes each time i hear/watch it in this movie.the movie ends on an up note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in baby's and johnny's lives. dirty dancing gives something new each time it is watched - it mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.

it's funny how time went by and never saw this movie...'till last week, when i was like under a spell. i saw it twice in a week and it still wasn't enough. it's a great movie and i will love to see it again. the story is great and it really moved me. i would love to live such a story. the actors are great, the music too and you can dream about your own love story. i just hope that someday i will find the opportunity to learn to dance like johnny and baby. i feel like dance connects people and brings them together. i think people should learn to dance...it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. it's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.

hello all you lovely dirty dancing fans!!!! i came across this message board when i was bored one day and think it's cool. i absolutely love dd! i first saw it at my friends house when i was 13 (now i'm 17) and got hooked!! i saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after, i bought the dvd for myself. at this stage, i have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it. ''i carried a watermelon?!'' it's gotten so bad that i bought the soundtrack and recorded micky and sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone!! most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but i don't care what they think of it, i know it's brill! i was reading the comments earlier and i have a few questions for you lot - 1. why are you asking trivial questions like what ages lisa and baby are? i don't think it matters that much. they are teenagers in the 60's, isn't that enough? 2. where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about? it sounds very interesting... please reply to this. i'd like to see other fans opinions... cheers! charliesangel415 xxx

like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick-flick. with it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (i've had) the time of my life & the wonderful she's like the wind makes this movie. i adore patrick swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot. he sings "she's like the wind" in the movie. the chemistry between swayze and co-star jennifer grey is amazing. i love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. but saying this dirty dancing 2: - havana nights is also great but patrick swayze scenes makes this. i love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn't dirty dancing. like i said it's an amazing chick flick. please let there be a 3rd because i love to see what happens with patrick's character johnny. jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey patrick makes up for that if you know what i mean!!! great movie and i'm so pleased billy zane didn't win the movie role. i heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance.

when young frances 'baby' houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have so much fun! one night, after wandering away from a resort activity, she stumbles upon a all night dance party with johnny castle and other fellow dancers. quickly enthralled by the raunchy dance moves, 'baby' is eager to learn when she has to fill in for penny just so she and johnny don't lose their jobs at the resort. but young 'baby' soon finds herself in a sticky situation; she has fallen in love with a man she knows her father will never approve of. however, when johnny is accused of stealing wallets, it is up to 'baby' to confirm his alibi by admitting that she was with him the night they were taken. johnny is fired anyway for getting involved with a visitor, but quickly realises what a mistake it was leaving 'baby'. he comes back with that famous line 'no one puts baby in a corner' and they show the resort exactly what they're made of.an amazing film, perfect for a girly night in. with groovy tunes, inspiring dances and a story that will make you feel all warm inside, this has got to be the greatest film of all time! **********

so good, the acting, cutting, directing in there may not be the best ever, but the dancing, the moves, the heat and the passion in this movie is definitely the best (well...atleast for me ^^) it really touched me, inspired me to learn dancing. i even especially registered to this site just so i could vote on it and contribute my support for this movie. for this movie, it literally gave me goosebumps when i watched it. i love it. jennifer grey is so pretty! patrick is so sexy in there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the first thing i'll do tomorrow, on my way to university will be to drop by the video store n buy a copy of it, n watch it again n again till i am old n wrinkly n cant dance with the movie any longer. before than i need to learn all the dance moves there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i first heard of this film from a friend. she loved it and always watched it. when she told me about it and said how old it was, i immediately decided that i wouldn't like it. i was so wrong. dirty dancing was such an amazing film! i love the music and the dancing. i bought the soundtrack and dvd immediately after watching it. patrick swayze and jennifer grey were brilliant in it. they captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. they were both such good dancers. after watching the film i wished i could dance like them and i'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and latin dancing soon. i've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it. dirty dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music. my favorite parts of the film are when baby goes into the staff's headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where baby and johnny dance together in front of everyone. i believe that everyone must watch dirty dancing at least once in their lifetime. if they don't, it's their loss!!

i think dirty dancing was a great movie, they tried to make another one havana nights which was good but it was nothing like dirty dancing. i would like to see another dirty dancing with the same people. without them i think it would be a mess. a lot of times movies are made then when they try to add on more they start to change the people an make the movies go down hill. i would love to see dirty dancing have another one to see what happened after they were able to be together. patrick an jennifer did so well together. this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one. but this time start where it left off an keep the same people in it.

i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like i am ever going to get bored of it. i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the tv together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance.by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on tv.this film is perfect! even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song "all you need is love" actually has some kind of a meaning.i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time we'll be able to see dirty dancing.

when dirty dancing was on tv in the middle of last year i was out so i didn't get to see it, my mum swore that i had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere. anyway getting to the point she couldn't find her video so for christmas i bought her the dvd, well she hasn't had a look in. it sat around for a while then one night i decided to take it upstairs to watch and i fell in love with it. this is a great film with lots of lovely scenes! i love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it! it's definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch dirty dancing again and again! dirty dancing - the way love is meant to be!

dirty dancing - i think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. i can remember as a kid i loved this movie and watched it over and over again without tiring of it.now that i'm a little older, i bought the dvd recently and still wasn't disappointed with the performance.swayze and grey create the atmosphere for this movie, even though it's claimed they don't get along, the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable! as the movie proceeds, we are sucked into their relationship, and believe every single one of their actions. the soundtrack is amazing, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between baby & patrick.the last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line "noboby puts baby in the corner." the song is perfect and the dancing is amazing! i would recommend this movie to anyone, at any age, it's just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8/10.

i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it. in the 1970's, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. it's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary's excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director. reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. while this film is hilarious and meatballs 2 is so bad that it's fun, meatballs 3 and meatballs 4 are absolutely dreadful. recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters.

no, it's not citizen kane. but would you expect it to be with a name like "meatballs"? it's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. does anyone quote "little darlings" line by line? or "whitewater summer"?this is just one of those movies that got into my brain when i was in junior high, and stayed with me all these years. every time i feel geeky, i mumble "spaz. spaz. spaz. spaz." or when we're hiking in the brush in the forest, i tell my husband, "i'm wudy da wabbit." (he doesn't get it). "it just doesn't matter. it just doesn't matter." i mean, this stuff is classic!disappointed with the dvd, though. wish there were special features, maybe a commentary or a making-of. but the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as an adolescent in the late '70s. maybe not my life... you can't help but want to run around out in the woods in shorty shorts and knee-high socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie.

meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since. bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him, while leading his cit's into once mischievous scheme after another! the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. this is not another sleazy, dumb, teen sex-fest. it is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. it is a must-see. watch out for spaz - he is by far the best character! (especially during the camp social - while bill murray hams it up for the camera - just watch spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with!) by far, one of my very favorite comedies of all time!

i can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. in my case i, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. for me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. while some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. when i went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. as i grew older i realized these night raids to the girls cabin that i participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time i thought it was real and it was fun. that's what meatballs (mb) is. mb captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. mb give a great example of pre-teens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. the opening title song that goes "are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks..." describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids. i personally enjoyed the two campers spaz and fink. what boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? what guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? while these two characters are somewhat over the top i bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. these two characters are a mix of charlie brown from peanuts and jack tripper & larry dallas from three's company. i would bet that most viewers even cheer for spaz in the egg carrying competition and for fink as he attempts to "beat the stomach" in the hot dog eating contest. lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. no super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. it is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie.

"meatballs" is an ode to summer camp. those of us who got to go to camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been.bill murray plays senior boys counselor tripper harrison, who really runs the camp. he reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves. young campers gravitate toward him and if he speaks to you, you feel like you are family. this is one of murray's best roles. he drives the film with his one liners and ad-libs.chris makepeace plays rudy, the loner camper who is taken under tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell.the rest of the campers and staff in the film were excellent as well.the overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally win. from rudy to spaz to the camp and even to tripper himself, the underdogs of the film are the stars. the movie has heart.the film is fun and funny without being cruel or oversexed as some teen movies are today. the cast look and act like real people.the comedy and heart draw you in to the point that at the end, just like at camp, you are sad to leave.in my summer camp experience we had underwear run up flag poles, mystery meat, trying to sneak a peek into the girls cabin, the lunatic-with-the hook stories around the camp fire, and moving sleeping people out of their cabins and putting them elsewhere. but we also had a dedicated camp staff guiding us to be the best we could be.my favorite scene is the cit overnight when they are canoeing across the lake singing a goofy song. the one line that cracks me up every time is when tripper is announcing light outs the evening before parent's day and he ends "tomorrow is parents day, and you must look rested or morty will be sent to the state penitentiary."

i'm not american, but meatballs still really hits me. maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can't really put my finger on and a place i can't quite remember.meatballs is just a great movie. it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible.if you're reading this you probably know what i mean.all i can say on top of what i've already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you're american.i guess you know what i mean by that too.

some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one for eating, one for breathing and the other one for s**ting... this is not a movie for them... but for those who enjoy using the brain... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there for a purpose, every single detail, the coffee mug, the red couch, everything... is a underestimated masterpiece... it is hilarious, is raw and totally realistic, that's how we actually interact.... it is a royal comedy... total causality...just hang on, don't let the first scene shock you..... hang on... and enjoy the show....

the kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them. i think of the mexican people who (either in an attempt to support mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top mexican stars) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when i went to watch it, it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect. i think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end, "what a piece of crap". in order to understand cronica de un desayuno, one has to be mexican, and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better, be part of them). there's nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has what many families, in mexico at least, share. one has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it. the older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his red couch, the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother is going to an excursion, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. the father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary, and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons... the stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the movie), a travestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his attempt of suicide, subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother?... the music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot, not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings. thanks good a movie like this was done and released.one of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.

all-monster congregation in the final film in universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. count dracula (an intense, dapper john carradine), calling himself baron latos, comes to dr. edelmann (onslow stevens) asking to be cured of his affliction. naturally, this is just a ruse. then, coincidentally, larry talbot (lon chaney), a.k.a. "the wolf man", shows up and of course he *really* wants to be cured.as others have noted, the monsters don't get equal screen time. the frankenstein monster (glenn strange) gets thrown in at the end just for the purpose of including all of the universal monsters. stock footage and library music are re-used here as well. the film spends maybe a little too much time with the dracula part of the story, although carradine gives an impressive, non-hammy performance in the role of the count. the film is mainly a showcase for stevens, who goes through a tragic character arc of his own, and does an excellent job. the women are gorgeous, and i have to say that i loved jane adams as the luminous nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked.of course, it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers.competently, professionally made chiller is, just for my tastes, not really scary at all, but entertaining regardless. it's a respectable series entry overall.7/10

a year after the release of the average "house of frankenstein", universal released another monster mash where all their famous character would collide once again. "house of dracula" would reunite dracula, the frankenstein's creature and the wolf man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio. directed once again by erle c. kenton, "house of dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (although still flawed) story that while far from perfect, is a more appropriate closure than the previous film.the story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "house of frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. count dracula (john carradine), tired of having to hide during sunlight, asks help to the brilliant scientist, dr. edelman (onslow stevens), a physician famous for his research in biology. edelman becomes fascinated by dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the mean time, larry talbot (lon chaney jr.), the wolf man, visits edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse. soon edelman realizes that dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. the discovery of the frankenstein's monster (glenn strange) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.after the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight-forward gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. the story (by edward t. lowe jr.), has many interesting themes, as the contrast between dracula and talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and edelman's increasing madness. probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of nina, a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids dr. edelman hoping to be cured of her condition.director erle c. kenton is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. despite the low-budget, kenton crafts a gothic horror that while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way. while it's never on the level of the originals, "house of dracula" recovers that charm that universal studios horror films used to have, and kenton makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine.the cast is very good this time, with carradine, chaney and strange reprising their roles (although strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. the addition of onslow stevens, jane adams and martha o'driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series, with stevens giving a terrific performance as dr. edelman. a small cameo by lionel atwill and the presence of skelton knaggs as the creepy steinmuhl complete one of the better cast universal horror films has had in years."house of dracula" is a nice addition to the series, specially after the mediocre "house of frankenstein". it's nice to see kenton back in form in a somewhat serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. it's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed.while far from perfect, it's also far from being the worst of the series. "house of dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters. later the monsters would be back in "bud abbott & lou costello meet frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a whole different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "house of dracula", but give it a chance, and let the monster roam for a last time. 7/10

coming at the end of the cycle of the universal monsters horror films, and before the golden age of sci-fi films, house of dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more cheesy {read:enjoyable} elements which would come to typify the sci-fi films of the coming era. lon chaney jr. plays the wolf man, and john carradine, dracula and glenn strange, the frankenstein monster.a mad scientist sets out to "cure" both monsters of their "sicknesses" by means of modern {read:mad} science. when the scientist's beautiful nurse-assistant is revealed to be a hunchback early in the film, the viewer is thereby alerted to the fact this film is not going to be typical universal fare; this film foreshadows the kind of sleazy exploitation we would come to take for granted in 1950's sci-fi.if you don't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black & white does not throw you off, this film is recommended viewing. afaik, this one is not currently available on dvd, but amc airs it occasionally, so keep a lookout, or you could always wishlist it on your tivo!

this is quite an entertaining b-flick in the universal horror series featuring dracula, the wolfman, and frankenstein's monster. the plot revolves around dracula (john carradine) and larry talbot, the wolfman (lon chaney jr.), separately visiting a revolutionary doctor. they both ask him if they can be cured, and the doctor attempts to devise a way for each. beneath the doctor's castle, they find frankenstein's monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the frankenstein series). of course, if things had went as planned, the movie would have turned out incredibly boring. instead, dracula can't suppress his appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected, by a blood transfusion, with vampirism. as a semi-vampire, the doctor goes insane and awakens frankenstein's monster. as with all of the universal horror series, the ending is completely unsatisfactory. a beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the doctor's two assistants, has a particularly gruesome end. plus, you just have to feel sorry for frankenstein's monster in this film - he's awake for around two minutes, kills one police officer, and then yet another building (what's this, the fifth now?) collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames. it is also unfortunate that the great character created in the wolf man (1941), larry talbot, is really reduced here. people underrate that film and chaney's performance in it. here, he would be justifiably criticized as wooden. all in all, though, it's a pretty fun movie at just 68 minutes. a nice waste of time. 7/10.

this is another universal fun filled fright fest.many people want to compare it to house of frankenstein.even though it has similar cast and the same director it can stand on its own.(it does appear that erle c kenton directed most of the universal horror films of the 40's).the plot recap:baron latos appears at the home of dr eidlemann seeking a "cure" for his vampirism.larry talbot (who somehow survived house of frankenstein) also shows up at the good doctors door seeking a cure for his affliction.after a failed suicide attempt talbot and the doctor find the frankenstein monster. to complicate matters just before he bites the dust, dracula infects the good doctor with his blood.the doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times.where this leads to is something you'll have to see for your self.carradine actually gives a very good performance as dracula. he isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles. it is hard to repress giggles when he appears in a top hat though.the cape/cloak is traditional but the hat has to go. where does the hat go when he changes into a bat...?onslow stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor. he's torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood lust he is now prone to. this is a very underrated performance.chaney brings even more life to the wolf man in his 4th appearance in that role.the monster isn't given much to do this time.just lay on the table until the end(some stock footage from the ghost of frankenstein is used).at least in house of frankenstein he was up and around a bit.yes this does stick to the basic universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running amok with torches.but it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.it gets a low 8.

this moody, creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting, as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (onslow stevens). the bat changes into a man known as baron latos, in reality count dracula (john carradine). he seeks dr. edelmann's help to cure him of his vampirism. eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse-assistant (jane adams), the wolf man (lon chaney), and frankenstein's monster (glenn strange). but dracula's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood, and he becomes a jekyll/hyde vampire himself. this is somewhat better than the prior year's "house of frankenstein", being less episodic and more exciting visually. there's a haunting scene where dracula tries to lure the second nurse (martha o'driscoll) into his world, where she is initially playing "moonlight sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. director erle kenton uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features. two performers are of note: stevens, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. adams, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. it all ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of 1940s universal horror, a little abrupt, with footage borrowed from "the ghost of frankenstein" (1942). i hope universal releases it soon on dvd (it was left out of their double-feature releases).

house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before; namely that universal's three most famous monsters; dracula, frankenstein's monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together. naturally, the film is rather messy therefore, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did, as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr. edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees lawrence talbot, a.k.a. the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelman's daughter, but talbot really is serious. when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf, the wolf man throws himself into the sea...where he ends up finding frankenstein's monster.overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein. the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does, as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster. dracula's plot is the biggest at first, but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. the wolf man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand, as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought, and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. the acting is good enough, with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. glenn strange is given nothing to do, and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman. overall, this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror; but as silly monster movies go, house of dracula is worth seeing.

my sister, dad, and i are really into d&d and one night we were browsing netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up. we thought we would try it out and i ended up almost dying from laughter. the writing and acting in this movie is so amazing! witty characters, great interaction, and hilarious moments kept us in stitches the entire time. i love this movie! it might not make that much sense for those who don't know about dungeons & dragons, but nevertheless, it is a good movie. this only goes to show that movies don't need an astronomical budget and big name actors/actresses to be a success. check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.

i don't play video games at all but my children do.i got a big kick out of this. would like to see more of this type of film. "very cool" as my youngest would say.interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting. like i said i don't play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this. it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change. this visual concept was different which caught my eye. plus the sound track was pretty good. i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film. who knows maybe i'll be a gamer someday.

i am so impressed, really. i expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else.ok, there's a ton of pretty geeky humor. but the movie is so well done. the acting is quite good.the dialog, while gamer cheesy at times, i guess to cater to the gamer crowd, is not bad at all. at times it's even, dare i say, great.when the female gamer, who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual (min/max) type gets all these additional attacks (seem right, i did not check the rules,) it was cool.the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie.the story moves right along. the transitions from game world to real world are well done. a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female, and sometimes by himself. pretty clever, i thought.the guy who decided to play a female, but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs. he even said tag at one point, and the female walked on to play the role ( sorry, i did not look her name up, she did great though.) the guy always trying to "get some", got a bit tedious, but i guess that was more gamer humor.there was just so much to like about the movie. lighthearted. fun! very well done and i am saying that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and i am not a d&d player.) as i said i expected so much less.movies often don't hold my attention, i end up listening to them while working on my computer. this one held my attention. i can't give a movie much higher praise.

there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on, this one is.after some years of fantasy role playing we split, me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become: a dork.you see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everybody.first you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack.then you help a little with the constitution, and while you're at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity too? this in turn frustrates the game master who doesn't know how to deal with this invincible gang. and after a while it bores the players too, so they start to create ever more exotic race-profession combinations, no matter how ludicrous it is.i created a druedain warrior monk, yeah, not that far from the film.and that's not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game (think the hunt for experience points), but just watch the film, it shows it all - and of course the stupidity of its most basic premisses.for this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. i don't exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. but once it became one, it had to be mapped into the game flow, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. the poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so.sure, it's not exactly a professional production, but i haven't seen a better satire in ages.

gamers: dr is not a fancy made movie, it's more like amateur video. horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. you will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun.i'm from hongkong and it's really hard to find rpers, none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d&d. watching gamers: dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. you see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; you hear terms like "fighter", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil".what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software rpg. gamers: dr provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. the movie goes both gamers's real life as well as in the d&d world. you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.i don't want to spoil anything, but in short, gamers: dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers. for people never play rpg game, i'm sure you still get many fun from it.

this movie brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a d&d group. while watching, i could not help but notice how vividly characters reminded me of myself and my gaming friends to the point where they acted literally the same as we do. including the bickering, the fighting, the internal jokes, driving the dm crazy. everything.it has it all. jokes that made me cry, action scenes which, even filmed in low-budget, i found uncannily awesome. the story is pretty straightforward and unsurprising, but that doesn't really matter, since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the npcs.seriously, if you're playing d&d or any similar rpg, i cannot stress this enough, watch this movie, it captured beautifully the spirit of d&d.

yes!! they finally got it down to perfection. what a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for generation-x, whether they know it or not. after disasters like sgt. kabukiman nypd, and getting screwed by blockbuster, our hero, lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it, stop catering to distributors, and let troma be all the troma it can be. lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic, outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet. this time, lloyd takes shakespeare's love story, turns it inside out, tromatizes it, and adds that long, lost, entertainment value it was always lacking. entertainment value, such as lemmy kilmister (the narrator), debbie rochon (the cook), joe fleishaker (the fat guy), and of course, brutal mutilations and toilet humor. tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story, and the crown jewel of the troma universe.years ago, in tromaville, n.j. business partners, monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films, which would produce supposedly tasteful, soft core films. monty considers cap his friend, but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company. on paper, and in books, it appears that monty gave away his life's work for free. fast forward to mid-90's manhattan, we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another, it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a limb, or preferably, a life. monty has a son, tromeo, nephew, benny, they, with their friend, murray martini, who's just a little too excited about all the carnage, wage war on the incestuous capulets, except monty, he's too drunk to care. like in the original, there is a confusing situation, leading to tromeo falling for cap's daughter, who he has never met, or never even knew about. unfortunately, cap is a sadistic pervert, who, not unlike tromeo's dad, has a thing for the bottle, and this would of course, lead to daddy's little chenshaw melon being physically, and emotionally abused, and molested, and kept in a plexiglas cage, off and on, depending on how foul of a mood cap is in. cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who, would make just about anyone uneasy, with or without the raisin loaf. with all these inconveniences, the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will this effect the big feud? it might, or might not, go a little something like the original, but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen, you'll never see it coming."the one with leo" is downright sleep-inducing compared to tromeo & juliet, but if watered-down, over-directed, big-budget, hollywood, garbage is what you've been programmed to go for, then by all means, go for it, but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a punch, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor, then you just might not hate this movie. tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream. full-blast exploitation with as much mean-spirited humor as anything from a young john waters. along with some badass acting, tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead, and not to mention, much input from james gunn, that really brought this one together. for more awesomeness from james gunn, check out lollilove, and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman, check out his next vision, terror firmer. tromeo and juliet is jaw-droppingly priceless exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one, and only, king of the b-movies. thank's, lloyd. 10/10

this movie is truly unique. it really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it entertaining to the modern generation. the romance between tromeo and juliet was believable, and erotic, not pulled off by many adaptations. it is also so funny i was almost crying with laughter.like with most troma its in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and yet add in some really good acting and a shakespeare plot. you really have to see this movie to believe it!there are some hillarious jokes in the credits (best credits i've seen since hot shots) loads of troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs. and lemmy from the house of motorhead narrates. i lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back. troma at its best, this film really is a gem, and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum, and might offend some people. for anybody bored with run of the mill cinema, with a wacky sense of humour you must see this film.

a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeare's tragic love story.the que family and the capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence. the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy. in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet, literature's most famous "star crossed" lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original, or close to original, lines. but the infamous troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end. that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is nonetheless pretty inventive. tyrone (tybalt in shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10many differently edited and rated versions exist. each contains violence, profanity, drug use, and sex, all with a big dose of bizarreness.

what often gets overlooked in agatha christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition to people's belief in the supernatural. in "nemesis", you can spot a lot of those subtexts - but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length. also lifting "nemesis" above other series entries ("they do it with mirrors", "4:50 from paddington", etc.), is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the suspense. and finally, jane booker is welcome to guard my body any time. (***)

after the return of "horror movies" (come on scream isn't scary!) i didn't have very high hopes for this low-budget three story horror movie. but i was positively surprised! man this is scary!!! the first 2 stories are simply brilliant. the first one about a new wed couple driving in a dark forest with their rv, when they bump into a fierce........(watch the movie)! the second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is home alone for one night.... i know it doesn't sound any special but it is scary. i promise you. the last story isn't scary but atleast not bad. it's about a biker and a ghosthouse. in fact the stories are based on real urban legends(i guess kevin williamson can steal ideas too).rent this movie it is good!!! i'd say i'ts the scariest three-short-story-horror-movie ever made!

terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion. you knew what to expect - and ain't that just so typical! :) unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. how lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family perpetually late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. and therein is the secret: terry & june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of today's strained plots with the 'de rigueur' dysfunctional family (made to look hip).personally, i vote the "bridge to far" episode as one of the best. in a way, terry's antics reminds me of basil fawlty - both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing!terry & june comes highly recommended. have your tea and biscuits ready!

when the long running 'happy ever after' came to an end, its characters- 'terry & june fletcher' were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel- 'terry & june', although their surnames were changed from fletcher to medford.terry has received a new job and as a result, he and june move to purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes- unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment, the boss inviting himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at d.i.y but cocking it up each time. a fellow imdb user branded this show as 'not clever' and 'never well written'. fair enough, it wasn't clever, but that was the whole point. as for 'never well written'- some of the episodes were pretty substandard, i will admit, but overall i found it to be extremely well written, highly amusing and very well acted.it was warm hearted slapstick, not dissimilar to the later b.b.c sitcom 'keeping up appearances'. eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving the show plenty of scope. terry scott was a comic genius, as he well proved in productions such as 'hugh & i', the 'carry on' films and of course, here! june whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right.i enjoy some modern shows- i.e 'still game', 'the catherine tate show', 'legit' and 'empty'. i even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy'- 'naked video', 'the young ones' and 'the comic strip presents' but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy, such as this. humour that you don't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up. for the record, 'terry & june' was wonderful stuff. special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well!

terry and june in my mind, is a all time classic, along the ranks with bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana coupland, but terry scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in 1994. i have all the dvds upto press and i look forward to getting all 9, also would be nice to see "happy after ever" released on dvdjune whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live on in my memoryterry scott r.i.p. there aren't many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class bit does get on some peoples wicks but i don't mind, i think it would be brilliant to see some celebration of the life of terry scott

one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time, 'terry & june' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70's and '80's.it started life as 'happy ever after', but when eric merriman decided he didn't want to write any more, it changed into this, hence the dropping of 'aunt lucy' and the fletcher's becoming the medford's. yes, it was cosy, domestic, middle-class stuff; the plots ran the gamut of clich√©s from the boss coming to dinner, the vicar organising a jumble sale, and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend. it was certainly not 'dreadful lazy comedy'. as for it being 'not clever', it was not meant to be. it was funny and well performed, and that was enough! i too loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80's ( 'spitting image', 'black adder', 'the young ones' etc. ) but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this. if nothing else, it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill. well, family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens, but where has it left us? take a look at the latest t.v. schedules. all soaps and reality dross. the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers, meaning they are jam packed with swearing, bodily function jokes, and explicit sexual references. and they are not remotely funny either.the 'alternative comedy' boom was good in many ways, but had a dark side. it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned, drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan, and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain' and 'tittybangbang' ( heaven help us ). if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

i used to enjoy "happy ever after", but was absolutely hypnotised by "terry & june". with aunt lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between terry and june, a middle aged, middle class english couple, and i thoroughly enjoyed it, losing myself quite happily in each episode.the 1980s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and terry and june certainly suited more traditional tastes. and mine - and i was a huge fan of "the young ones", too! each week, terry got into a silly situation and june got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to bail him out. how dated the shows seem now - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends of the 1980s featured - such as the cb radio storyline of 1982 (cb radio was legalised in england in november 1981), which saw terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a lorry! i've been watching the shows again recently on dvd, and i still think they're terrific! not loved by the enlightened elite - the chattering classes, but a huge hit with the masses! wonderful!

a true comedy.the dialog is fast and very witty.eleanor parker at her physical peak .flynn as only flynn can be"the charming rogue'..although now past his prime.. most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well. if you haven't seen this movie please give a look.you will be surprised at flynn's comedy timing.the scenes between him tucker, parker and "cudddles" sakal are hilarious.just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive parker,this movie is worth a look.the romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from hollywood's golden past. my bet is that never say goodbye won't disappoint.

a fine romantic comedy. errol flynn shows what a deft touch for comedy he possessed. a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster self. the comedic writing on this film is excellent. eleanor parker does a nice job as flynn's ex wife whom errol is trying to win back. eleanor is also easy on the eyes. the sets exude 1940's glamour and style where appropriate.flynn's comedic timing and wit are displayed to full effect here, watch his double takes, his ability to verbally counter punch with a snappy comeback or act the straight man, and his total believability and sincerity where required, this guy could act! it is a shame errol did not get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was multi-talented to the extreme. if you enjoyed "it happened one night" with gable and colbert or some of the william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this.well paced and lots of laughs. a lost diamond of a movie.

this movie is a hidden gem. i can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time. errol and eleanor parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple. and their chemistry is impeccable. i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood. i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn. it's nice to see errol playing a father as well. by all accounts from his very own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. also, the supporting cast is wonderful as well. you can't go wrong with supporting players such as hattie mcdaniel and lucile watson. hattie mcdaniel makes a movie that much better from the get-go. this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home. enjoy!!!

this was the third time i tried to watch this film. the previous two times, i found the beginning so sickeningly sweet and "schmaltzy" that i just stopped watching. however, now that i am a little older and more compulsive, i forced myself to watch all the film and i was very surprised to see that i actually liked it quite a bit. so, i look at the movie much the same way i would look at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees centigrade for all those metric-lovers out there). sure, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you'll get used to it--so resist that urge to jump out right away!! the film begins with a lengthy exchange between flynn and his daughter, played by a lispy patti brady. some may find there conversations very cute and endearing, though others may find them a bit hard to take since these moments are so gosh-darn sweet! in a way, it was some amazing acting by flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having kids or acting domestic especially that he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this film--now that's acting!! never say goodbye concerns the divorced couple, flynn and parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. since they both love each other as well as their lispy kid, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will once again tie the knot. however, there are some serious problems standing in their way: lucille watson (who plays her usual over-bearing and controlling mother-in-law character), flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is errol flynn and he is divorced, so you gotta expect him to have a girl somewhere) and a marine (played by forrest tucker).not unexpectedly, all this does get worked out by the end and everyone lives happily ever after. however, despite it being formulaic and predictable, the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch. flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very good with comedy-romance and it's just a lot of fun to watch him. also, the film has the ever-scene chewing cuddles sakall--he's just so gosh-darn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this type of film. and, despite the sweetness, the film is pretty well-written. the bottom line is the film is fun.so my recommendation is that you do watch this film and force yourself not to retch at the sickeningly sweet aspects of the film. once you've gotten over this, the rest of the film is a picture that is well worth your time.

a young girl becomes a war-time marine's pen-pal, and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more "available," comic complications ensue. all ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. errol flynn's dead-on impression of humphrey bogart from "casablanca" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot). it is tucker, though, who "tucks" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in "f-troop" and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little patti brady charms as tucker's actual pen-pal friend. a fine, lightweight "coming home" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.

errol flynn had quite a gift for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited. given the right material this film demonstrates that he could have happily been quite at home in cary grant style, gentle comedies. out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best. patti brady gives a fine performance in the child part and eleanor parker looks simply stunning throughout the film. an added bonus is the wonderful hattie mcdaniel who is sadly underused in this film- a welcome presence none the less. flynn carries off his comedic duties with the same easy style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles. the fact that he makes it look like it's easy doesn't mean that it is. a super little family comedy, great for the christmas period or any other time you feel like being cheered up.

this movie is based on the game series: final fantasy. this one particularly is about ff7 or final fantasy vii. i loved the game, and i was very happy to see it be transformed into a movie, i loved the cg, that was awesome. lot's of great fight scenes, action, and characters to make the movie memorable. if your a die-hard fan of the game you will love this movie. personally, i'm not a die-hard fan of the games, but i am starting to become one.my favourite character out of final fantasy vii besides cloud, would have to be cid. i love cid, i think he's cute. i was amazed how real the cg images were, it was amazing, it's the game in 3d. i had a great time watching the movie, and by the way, i love the aeons to, especially bahamut, he's great! overall i gave this movie a 9, because yes, i loved it. i thought it was a really really good movie, and yes it's on my list of movies to get. the characters were amazing, loved the cg, story was wonderful, with lot's of action and fight scenes. all-in-all, it's the best movie i've seen yet, based on a video game.

i am an avid ff7 fan, for instance i have the game then sell it(bad mistake) but then buy it again (good mistake...erm)anyways, yes this film is very good, the fights are very cool, music very good, and the cgi you cant falter.only thing disappointing with the film i felt was the lack of other character involvement, it was almost all cloud which although is a great character, u cant beat a of cid and barret.but despite that the film was great in my opinion, and a must watch.overall a great film give and will give it 9/10 squaresoft, make more films like this and you'll be worshiped more so than you already are!!!!

o m g!!! did you ever think they would make a movie about it?? well i knew they would, but i didn't know when!! and now its here at last!!! when i received it yesterday through the post i put it into my (wicked) stereo that plays dvds and instantly had this huuuuuuuuuuge grin on my face as cloud appeared (looking well....gorgeous!!) and they followed by all the other fascinating characters from final fantasy the game! including tifa and aeris, my favourites....(they are pretty too in this) the graphics knocked me out!!!! they were truly amazing. so real down to the last hair!!! the story line is ok bit confusing, especially as my version of the film was in japanese, but of course - being a long time final fantasy fanatic - i did not mind a bit - i just read the subtitles!!! all the characters talk the way they would do in the game, and reno and rude are still ridiculous. the dragon scene is wicked too. just looks so good!!! anyway.... the graphics were, amazing....the storyline , fantastic....and the basic idea of even having a ff7 film.......genius!!!

i still can't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3d images. the moment i heard it from my friends over at a forum, i swear to myself that i am going to make myself watch it.i managed to watch parts of it at a fellow shopping centre where they had many advent children dvds and showed it at a few laptops for sale. obviously i was overjoyed but it was still not enough. then i headed off to youtube.com to search for the movie. all i came up with was music video dedications. until that fateful day...i found it. i watched it despite all the distractions because i knew that i have to watch or else i will be called a loser.enough about me more on the movie. as if final fantasy vii wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! my most favourite part was the end of sephiroth's life. cloud's omnislash couldn't be better. but i wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you. you have to watch it for yourself!!! get the dvd now!

i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago. the vhs print was a little faded looking, but i was very haunted by what i had watched. did it all make sense? well, honestly, no it didn't. however, this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects. the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression.well, when i found out that anchor bay had released this oddity on dvd, i picked it up immediately. i was very pleased by the transfer, though i felt the extras rather lacking. though the film concerns the "o" and sir stephen characters, it really has nothing to do with pauline reage's original novel or the 1974 film the story of o. however, the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind. "o" decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong. her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men. naturally, sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress. however, the tables are turned when "o" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. suddenly, sir stephen feels the threat...i feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really make this film a classic. the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of "o"'s fellow brothel mates, but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored. like the political setting, the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging. no one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. (however, "o" does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer). one prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk, naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog. another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. she cannot let that vision go. she treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. as for "o", she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. when he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. of course, in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father. i was very, very disturbed by this image. i truly felt for "o" at this point in the film. she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why. her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love. another curious aspect of the film is the young child (that ages at the end) that sells fortune in a box. it is a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. at one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. now, if that isn't symbolism for you! (laugh) all in all, i really love this film. i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. it has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant to arouse. like the lives of the characters, the sex acts are empty. they are motions, but lack feeling and tenderness. (once again, the only tender scene is between "o" and the young man). "o" believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, however, she finds in the end that she has choices. she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness, however, she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew. the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions, however, some things don't need answers. the viewer will make the judgment that works for them. i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary. i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later. it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released. this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score. there is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine. i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music.

i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form. i especially loved david boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy. the first part of the movie was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic but interesting - and it was all downhill from there.i found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls (keira and lisa) get out of the blackmail&betrayal scot free, nary a trace left on their psyche. i know the movie amended the darker ending of the play - and i am not saying i missed the murder part. but i surely needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and i was left groaning in frustration with the ending. (it's why i gave it only a 9)but definitely an interesting film.

finding the premise intriguing, and reading the reviews, and being an angel fan, i watched this movie. it's sexy and original, and quite entertaining. david boreanaz is keith. he's a hunky married man, stay at home dad, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. he makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man. they'll do anything to get into his bed, including beg, lie, and blackmail, but they mostly try to push his buttons. the nuttiness that ensues sends keith reeling, and pushes friendships to the edge. david boreanaz shows a little skin in this one-- and he's looking hot. yes-he plays a sleazy cheat - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end. one more thing, when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..yeah!!", it's hard to see them as a victim of rape.

this is a great movie. i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it (mainly for caroline dhavernas) it grew on me.it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls/young women are not punished for their sexuality. the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions.some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes - which were not over the top or distasteful. the male characters in the movie were brilliant - david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk - and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much. the other two younger male characters were good too, without being overbearing.this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them.

i am really amazed how little fame this film had. i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc.don't be idiots - if you are looking for a good fun take this movie - this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great.it's about ..... well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they?? it's nice and cute and gives good time . the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable.why i gave it only a 9? well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on. in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable. small spoiler: the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him. now i am not talking about some small cry but- no - hysteric cry and 30 sec after that the father goes out and "baby is sleeping"- excuse me , when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama - it's fun and this should be overlooked.

my friends and i rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about. we all thought it would be like "a canadian american pie" but when we watched it we were completely surprised, we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it! it was nothing like american pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore (seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie for not only it's plot but the actors and the great writing. there wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable. everything is very realistic and relate-able for anybody living in a small town with little prospects. i absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance, it's worth it.

this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly. each of the three "teenage girls" offer their own believable, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa. if one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, keith's character treated lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion. david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely. the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled. although the movie appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desire.

i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie "these girls" at the philadelphia film festival. going into the movie, i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting. so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down."these girls" is the story about three best friends from a small town. keira (caroline dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do. lisa (holly lewis) will be going away to a christian school after the summer. and finally, glory (amanda walsh) who plans on spending her summer babysitting. but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark (david boreanaz) the sexy older hunk who they baby-sit for. fun times and a lot of laughs ensue¬Ö i normally don't like movies like "these girls" but there is something about this movie that i really liked. i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic. three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later. it's a pretty funny tale about growing up, friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy i can see majority of this film happening in real life.the subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the united states. all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16. now in the usa even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies won't finance a film like this because of the sexual content. this information was actually confirmed by the director himself john hazlett at the q&a after the film. the thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor. not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life. go figure.what the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters. i liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "now & then" characteristic to them. the jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top. everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama. the script was very strong.the acting was very good for the most part. i thought all the three girls were great. caroline dhavernas who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time "wonderfalls" was just terrific; as well as holly lewis and amanda walsh who both did a fine job as well. david boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes. the guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role.i had the pleasure of meeting john hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film. i am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. i think with a little marketing behind it, it could have taken off. sadly it's going to be one of these direct to dvd films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see. i think with what little budget mr. hazlett had to work with, the film turned out well and i think he did a fine job directing this little gem.for someone who typically hates teen sex comedies i can honestly say i really enjoyed this film. the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused. this is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it. i know i will be sure to buy this film when it comes on dvd on may 16, 2006. if you're a fan of coming of age stories, teen sex comedies, or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years.moviemanmenzel's final rating for "these girls" is an 8/10.

i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from (one of?) the executive producer at the atlantic film festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us.filmed in atlantic canada, the movie is about three teen-aged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth, devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30-year old man, despite much protestation.it's definitely worth a watch, but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit (male 18-25), so i was shaking my head at the character's antics rather than laughing. inspite of this, the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining, without so much laughing.

this film is outstanding! on this date of apr, 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time. it had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in. at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked, with a wife that seems close to going her own way. the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool. paulina porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot. trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry, paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron eckhart was cool at first, and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business. then he spots nicks silver briefcase, and the day changes for the weird and violent. there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. but, paulina's dallas steals the show i think. her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application, is outrageous. as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy,but as with any rule there are exceptions. paulina is as one has never seen her before in films. sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with tom selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence. if your looking for film to add to your collection, this one is worth the price. paulina in the nude is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one might hope one has. love,friendship,sex and violence in a terrific mix. when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind, and i know you will feel the same way.

very tightly written, acted, and filmed. violent, but not too much so. whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. there isn't a wasted scene in this movie. "the usual suspects" was superb ensemble acting; this is a collection of outstanding individual performances. i rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.

i watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. the best of the best. it was never any dull and always moving, every hour there's another character bothering (trying to kill) him. you never know what's next. in one word terrific !!!

truly a great film... i stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because aaron eckhart (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors) was in it as well as paulina porizcova... the lovely former si swimsuit model does get nude in the film, but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it... it's very exciting, and the character development is fantastic... eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working, and he steals this film... it is very dark and violent, but i enjoyed in immensely....

i saw this movie yesterday. i must admit - i love it! it's like early tarantino, but better. really a must, but... don't show this movie to anyone younger than 18. it's full of blood and sex (rape scene is great :) ). now i'm just waiting for other movies of this director and a dvd release.

i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released, but it slipped by them unnoticed. it is well written, witty, satirical, and thoroughly enjoyable. it's like a video game brought to life. you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next. the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect.one last word: for you mickey rourke fans...the mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end.

i saw this movie by accident while in paris. i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn't a preview or a short film, i was hooked. paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting. i can't say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal. the rest of the cast performs very well too. don't get me wrong, this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression.finally, not speaking french in france paid off for once! i didn't stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it.

i turned over to this film in the middle of the night and very nearly skipped right passed it. it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it. in the end, i thought it was great.an interesting storyline, good characters, a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch. this was, in fact, the first i'd heard of this movie, but i would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema.my imdb rating : 8 out of 10

how 'thursday' managed to avoid attention remains a mystery. a potent mix of comedy and crime, this one takes chances where tarantino plays it safe with the hollywood formula. the risks don't always pay off: one character in one sequence comes off inappropriately silly and falls flat. in the lead role, thomas jane gives a wonderful and complex performance, and two brief appearances by mickey rourke hint at the high potential of this much under- and mis-used actor. here's a director one should keep one's eye on.

this movie was excellent from start-to-finish. i was riveted by the action, the black humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn. thomas jane is a great actor and i hope to see him in many more movies to come. reading through other people's comments, i have to admit i never once thought about tarrantino while watching "thursday" but now that i think about it i guess there are some similarities. i guess i don't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else. the rape scene between porizkova and thomas jane is one for the record books - sexiest scene ever.

i loved this film! fantastically original and different! a solid, intense, hard-core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of (dark?) humor. if you're tired of the typical, overdone, ridiculous hollywood b.s. movies, how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take, then this film is for you. fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and solid performances by all actors, not a weak character or performance in the film. skip woods' film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts, his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film (not a bad mix at all in my opinion). this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film. the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it, everyone i've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it. this film is a welcomed change/alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today, even with their big name actors, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. it's a terrifically wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw (i mean that in a good way, no phony hollywood polish here) ride. thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen, you did an incredible job!

is thursday an original film? heck no, but it is a lot of fun! i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick. i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes (i really liked the first seen at the convenience store), some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well. some good performances from young actors, paulina porizkova was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron eckhart (who has gone on to impress me further in ¬ëyours friends and neighbours' and ¬ëerin brokovich'). so if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out ¬ëthursday'.

very violent and nicely filmed movie. paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too. this movie has lots of black humor. this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster. there will be sometimes when you wouldn't know whether to shiver or to smile and think "am i laughing at someone who is killing people?"

i love the premise, but it's replay value is only for certain parts(the opening scene of course). some characters are a bit outrageous, but they are entertaining none the less. i think the ballping sh-t was pushing it. i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle, i just think that the flashback's story could have been better. also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining, but once again i think the story was told sloppy. it really seems unbelievable. i actually believe swordfish (the other movie woods has written) more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sh-t a secret all the time, and has organizations set up that the public will never know about.thursday is the best quentinesque movie i've seen. i think woods is imaginative,clever and has witt; however, his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script (not stone's movie) level. how old is he anyway?

i was referred to this movie by a friend. i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher lampbert so i rented it, and come to find out that wasn't christopher lampbert it was thomas jane who was great it this film. i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie. in my book thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the thursday. this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane. but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood video's on vhs. so dust off the old vcr and pop in thursday because it gets pee wee's seal of approval

thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since quentin tarantino took the genre by storm with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film. thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location. it works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable, and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller. there is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. the plot follows casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife. the pair wants to adopt a child, but things turn awry when casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime, nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal...the first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. we see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments. the scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. thursday is a very funny film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike. it's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. the acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. thomas jane holds the film together well in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from james legros, paulina porizkova, michael jeter, glenn plummer and mickey rourke back him up nicely. this film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances; thursday is likely to suffice.

hey community! my question is about the song, the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed. not his "ragga application song" but the cozy one! thanks this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment. i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing.hey community! my question is about the song, the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed. not his "ragga application song" but the cozy one! thanks this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment. i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing.

we are taken to a convenience store where nick is looking at coins in his hand figuring if he can get the special, a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry. he decides to go for the larger size, which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't qualify him for the cake. he tries to argue with the indian clerk at the register, who keeps her ground. with her it's a matter of principle. well, nick gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her. the tone of the story is set from the start. the people we are about to meet are not nice guys. there are nick, his girlfriend, dallas, and their partner billy hill. they are drug dealers. nick decides to visit casey, his friend, and former partner in crime, in houston. he wants to do one more transaction and then go to paris with the profits from selling the drugs he is bringing. what he doesn't realize is that casey has gone straight. he is an architect, married to christine, and wants to adopt a baby.casey doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house. he decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing them down the kitchen drain. the untimely arrival of ice, a pizza delivery man, takes casey by surprise. this man has been sent to kill him, but before that, casey brings out some weed to share with ice, who has a talent for rapping.it is at this point that dr. jarvis, the man from the adopting agency, arrives. casey's application shows a two year gap that he can't justify. jarvis begins to doubt about the prospective father. at this time, dallas makes an entrance. she is a woman that asks questions point blank, like when she demands to know whether jarvis enjoys watching porn. jarvis, who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff. dallas has decided to seduce casey at all costs. there is a surprise in store as billy hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees, shooting dallas in the process. billy hill has also come to off casey, but he is overpowered.casey gets the visit of kasarov who wants to get his money from nick; in his absence, he'll take it from casey. kasarov gives a deadline and casey makes up his mind to outsmart all these low lives. he has all the parties come to his house at an appointed hour and the different factions will take care of themselves. in the end, casey has a better plan that includes taking christine for a stay in paris.never having heard about "thursday" we were drawn into it because of the talent in it. skip woods directed his own material. this seems to be a film with good intentions. at times the film remember others of the same genre, not a sin by any shape, or form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here in the imdb site. for starters, "thursday" shows a witty skip woods that has gone to write other films, notably, "swordfish". the screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles, pertaining to the action. denis lenoir does wonders with the mostly interior photography. thomas jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his casey. although hard to imagine, he has beat the odds and made something out of himself. this actor, seen recently in the television series "hung", is one of the actors we don't tire of watching. a dark haired aaron eckhart is a welcome addition to any film. he is a greasy criminal that shows no redeeming qualities, or anything close to remorse and doesn't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. james legros has nothing to do. same goes for paulina porizkova, a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction, or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. we enjoyed glenn plummer, who appears as ice. he does a mean audition on the telephone. michael jeter and mickey rourke also appear.

this movie is excellent. not because it does anything special or new, but because it is consistently great in all of its parts. no part stands out as being "ground-breaking" or "stellar", but all parts are far above mediocre, and that makes, to me, an excellent movie.i own several copies of this movie, and may acquire it on collectors dvd or blu-ray, someday (holding off right now due to high blu-ray prices, and of course the face that i don't have a blu-ray player... but that's beside the point of this review).it stars off sort of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters, and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end.wait, no, it does not start out ordinary.it starts out sort of like what a qun. tar. movie wishes it could be. with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes... very, very wrong.by the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and a few people are dead, and a few people are very rich. i won't tell you who... watch and enjoy! overall rating: 10/10, a**, excellent!

surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a de-sanctified church to restore a life size and life like crucified man . the piece was christ and the two thieves, however christ was long ago sold off. trouble starts once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman. from that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul. creepy, scary and much better than you think the film works because its cast sells the events which are decidedly adult. it helps that these are real people who are flawed so its easier to relate to them. i really liked this film, and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade i was shocked at how good it is. definitely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem.

"l'ossessa" (released in english under many titles and the eeriest of them certainly is "the eerie midnight horror show") is one of the best italian rip-offs of "the exorcist". to really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor. "l'ossessa" is at the same time sleazy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving.danila (stella carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she's going to restore. it's a wooden statue of christ, a demonic christ, maybe already overcome by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning dark deeds. the face shows infinite torment. the statue dates from the 15th century. danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor - the statue seems almost alive! she lives with her parents. her mother luisa (lucretia love) lives a dissolute life and doesn't care too much for keeping up appearances. her father mario (chris avram) observes everything with disenchanted eyes.the wooden statue will soon assume a human form (ivan rassimov) and possess danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. an amazing scene! the poor danila, from now on, will suffer the torments of hell.danila (the lovely stella carnacina) was ravished, violated, possessed by the devil and now following his orders, she will try to seduce others. ain't she emulating her sleazy mother luisa (lucretia love) who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bunch of roses? there is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving, when stella carnacina runs in despair through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) of a small italian town screaming her heart out. luigi pistilli is a very good exorcist. his performance is, as usual, intense. the exorcism scenes (particularlly the final battle) are very, very amateurish, but this will only enhance the fun (and/or emotion?) if you've really got a sense of humor.stella carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and that's a factor that adds to your pleasure when she's naked, but i think that the film could have explored more her natural beauty. lucretia love is a very good sleaze companion (her nude scene with the roses... well.:) other italian exorcist rip-offs i would like to recommend for you are: malabimba (very sleazy and released uncut and digitally restored) "evil eye" (malocchio) - "the exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "evil eye", but others films, like, for instance, "rosemary's baby" should also be taken into account. "evil eye" is completely over the top. not that sleazy but with plenty of gorgeous italian and spanish actresses. you'll be drooling all over the film. the film is ridiculous, the story doesn't make any sense, but if you see it in the right mood you might feel moved! - a diabolical sect, possession, murders, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women all around. a wild ride! if you liked "evil eye", see also "ring of darkness" (un'ombra nell'ombra). this film can be found in the alternative market. search this title in the imdb. there are good reviews about it.p.s. - "l'ossessa" has many different faces. it's exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. it's cheap, cheesy... sleazy (but not that much) and it has an underlying "moral" message. this strange brew can sometimes be very funny. we all already know that "l'ossessa" is an "exorcist" rip-off so why can't we see it on its own terms? yes, mario gariazzo was trying to earn a fast buck, but he was able get the most out of a shoestring budget. the story is well told, the film is atmospheric and overall the actors are committed to their roles. see the film with an open mind and you may discover two or three new things.

italian soft x exorcist clone.woman buy statue of crucified thief. said thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies.ivan rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. mostly due to his gift of evil looks. and because he was never above doing nudity. good on him.the actress in the lead did a decent job. her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped.this one has a similar plot element to most italian horror films. the girl's parents are filthy rich, and depraved. watch it to get the details.laura gemser's husband, gabriel tinti, also appears as a random stud. his part is basically phoned-in, but like a cheap beer, it did the job.fault the director for its failings. this could have been a horror/sex classic.

l'ossessa, also known as the tormented or the sexorcist, or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show, is a forgotten exorcist rip-off which contains one of the best horror moments i've ever seen. the scene is when the crucifix comes alive. this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great fxs). it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene.this is one of the most frustrating movies ever. imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip-off. had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. she, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is stupid!!!if you like so-called "euro-cult" movies, the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other euro-cult movies. but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatas, the remaining 45 minutes suck. boring. it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate (badly) the exorcist. so, watch the first 45 minutes of l'ossessa and enjoy the 1970s fashions, the sleaze and the amazing statue-comes-alive-to-ravish-the-girl scene but after the first 45 minutes, press stop and eject, and might as well go clip your toenails.

it's true that this is not realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre that i look to for realism. what counts is that the characters are likeable and, as needed, sexy. shalom is beautiful and relaxed and jake weber is handsome in an offhand kind of way. they have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts, sexual attraction. i would love to see either of them in another movie. and yes, the clown is pretty cute too.

"cherry" tells of a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby but isn't quite sure how to go about it. this easy going little sleeper is full of quirky characters and tongue-in-cheek situational humor. fresh, fun, mold breaking stuff, i happened to really enjoy this flick...for whatever that's worth. recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.

i watched this movie thinking it was going to be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the corniness, bad special effects, etc. but, i was pleasantly surprised. not to say that it's the best vampire movie i have ever seen, but it certainly isn't the worst. i liked the whole alternate reality/dream state that played into the movie. the graphics were quite well for a straight to dvd movie and i liked the overall look of the film. i enjoyed the main character sai. i usually end up hating the female leads but there was something about her that kept me interested. yes, she does make some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but i was expecting that too. i don't know if i'd highly recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised. i'm putting this one on my guilty pleasures list.

i gave this movies a 7 out of 10. i think the general dislike of this movie is due to people not really understanding the plot. if you think about the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense, it just doesn't ever give you a dumbed-down explanation. its true that the special effects are sub-par and it appears semi low budget, but i think the originality of the plot keeps you drawn in. people say that the vampire genre is overdone and clich√©d out, but with bled, what you get is not your conventional vampire flick. its a dream/alternate reality story- line with a vampire/eternal life spin on it. i loved it. the only thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that i personally dislike movies where most of the people have accents. but like i said earlier, if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie..

i don't see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews?!?! i loved this movie! bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, i can see why you would not like this film. it was a great twist from the average, played out vampire movie. if you are looking for a fresh, new and ingenious new vampire movie, then this is for you. but if you want one of those turn into bats, wolves and melt in the sunlight movies, then go watch your old played out dracula flicks. sure, it is a bit on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. i'm very happy that i found this movie, because i was about to give up on the vampire genre fro good. i thought this film was brilliant! i give 2 thumbs up to the writer, director and everyone involved in the film.

i caught this movie on the horror channel and was quite impressed by the film's gothic atmosphere and tone. as a big fan of all things vampire related, i am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos, in this case, a ghoul-like creature residing in a lovecraftian other dimension. the director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject, using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space- the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story. the characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind-altering substance, where a shape-shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires, whilst draining them of their life essence. there are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. i enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story, chris ivan cevic and alex petrovich, who were very attractive hunks, always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers! the special effects make up and creature effects were well done, and the set design of the vampire's dimension was very effective. all in all, an enjoyable take on vampire myths, and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. the only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity, as it would have suited the plot and themes.

like a twisty country road, "tough luck" takes the viewer for a ride. there is nothing wrong with plot curves, as long as believability doesn't fly out the window. unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience's belief tolerance. nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting, character development, and wonderful carnival atmosphere. do not expect to like any of the characters. armand asante, norman redus, and dagmara dominczyk, play shady con-artists, not exactly the type of person easily admired. the double crosses come fast and furious, and the final cross is a bit of a stretch. recommended. - merk

tough luck follows a homeless drifter as he becomes entangled in the underground crime world of deception and chaos. archie(norman reedus) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose. he is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named ike(armand assante) hires him for work. soon ike discloses a strong desire for archie to murder his mischievous wife, divana(dagmara dominczyk), an erotic dancer for the carnival. things soon get complicated when archie falls in love with divana and warns her of the scheme. they become involved in a very steamy affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer, after which they soon make a plan. together they plot to murder ike, but things don't go quite as planned.i would be lying if i said that this film didn't surprise me. i was, personally, blown away by how good this film was. upon renting it several years back, i was expecting another clich√© thriller with a lot of the typical elements and themes that are shown in a lot of films of that type these days. within minutes i was hooked and found myself quite involved with the world of this film. it's the kind of film, much like buffalo '66, that just sucks you in and transports you into the style and the feeling of paranoia. it is a film that really pulls it off in stunning fashion. one thing i particularly appreciated was how the film depicted it's characters. the film isn't as easy and clear cut as it may appear in the plot summary. these are characters that you actually grow to care about and are fascinated by, including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys. in truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this film. all of the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true-to-life. there aren't many films that manage to accomplish this task as flawlessly as this film does, but it's definitely a film style that i like and i want to see more of from films today. there were quite a few crime films that were like that back in the early 50s, but there hasn't been one as gripping and unique as this ever since! in terms of flaws, i have mostly very minor gripes. the film itself isn't exactly original. however, i doubt that most folks would expect it to be original. the film's editing style also may be irritating to some folks as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky cam throughout. while i wasn't bothered by it and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere, i'm sure most viewers will not be as enthralled by it and may find it generally off-putting. despite the minor flaws, however, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. it's so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good. it seems as if this film was a direct-to-video release, though this film is far better than that. had it been put in theaters, it wouldn't have won any awards nor would it have been seen much, but it would have a lot more recognition than it has today. recognition that this film deserves. tough luck is an astounding, entertaining, and twisted neo-noir thriller with a real sense of class and style juxtapose and with enough substance to make the average moviegoer more than simply satisfied.

i watched this movie on hbo and i had a good time.the director has done a great work. i found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started. norman reedus's performance is cool. i expect more chilling movies from him.i was so absorbed that on occasions i wanted to grab gun from norman and shoot that snake girl. hehe. i like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly. the ending was what i wanted :)) this movie is filled with twists of moments. you expect this but something else happens. in the beginning, those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes.although it was not shown when norman reedus changed currency notes? or is it me standing by fridge. :)

this is a quirky heist/caper film, one that seems predictable at first then keeps surprising until the last scene. the protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a little carnival, where he's paid to kill the manager's belly dancer wife divana then ends up falling for her himself. she's alluring, tricky and deadly and she keeps disappearing and popping up again like some sort of magician's trick. the film's other props include her duplicitous husband/employer (played by the talented armand assante), some nasty dominican mobsters and most important to the plot, a suitcase full of money. just like the old "shell game," the one where you have to guess which one the pea's under, you'll be guessing who's got the money, and like the victims of the hucksters who run such games, you'll probably guess wrong. dagma dominczyk, as lovely divana, is a talented performer and an eyeful, whether she's dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working her grift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. norman reedus is fine as the young con who is flummoxed by the elusive beauty he was paid to kill. don't count him out, however, for he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for. this oddball film is worth a look.

i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.the early part is difficult to follow, but later it clears up. i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.some of the acting is unconvincing, but maybe that's because i was always expecting some kind of double-cross. in that case, the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other, so it fits very well.the important theme is the carnival owner (assante) is laundering money for a local casino & his snake-charmer wife (dagmara dominczyk) wants to steal it. she complains to "archie" (reedus) how terrible her life is, and how he could help her get out of it.there are 3 or 4 plot twists (which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends), and just when you think you have solved the mystery, something else will happen.my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time.

this one surprised me.i read a few reviews beforehand that called it a good b-grade movie and was prepared for the worst. halfway through it i suddenly realised i was completely wrapped up in it and enjoying it a lot. there were some really tense moments that had you sitting forward fiddling nervously with the remote control or any other object in reach. overall this movie definitely doesn't deserve the b-grade tag.credit must be given to director, gary ellis and writers, bill boatman & todd king for their movie debut. i hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio backing.

didn't really know what to expect from this movie-and found myself being pleasantly surprised. i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in.i'm not big into hustler movies or con movies, but i have to say, this one roped me in within minutes. probably because i couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who. this movie is stylish and fast-paced, with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances.while i was impressed with most in the film, i must say dagmara dominczyk was simply excellent.give it a chance-it's a really fun film.

not having heard of this film, it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently. gary ellis, the gifted director of "tough luck", does wonders with the screen play written by bill boatman and todd king. the film involves the viewer from the start.archie, the young hustler at the center of this story, has been involved in all kinds of petty crime. in fact, we witness a confrontation right at the beginning which makes him get out of new orleans, as fast as he can. he ends up in the carnival that is run by the mysterious ike. archie falls for davina, the woman he should have been wise to stay away from. the result proves a fatal judgment for archie who then becomes the object of double crossing all around.the director should be commended by the casting of norman reedus, who obviously is loved by the camera. in spite of his nature, one feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place. the beautiful dagmara dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer divana who, in spite of being ike's lover, entices archie into falling heads over heels with her. armand assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film."tough luck" shows a new director, gary ellis, showing he will go to do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing.

rks after the success of ghayal started work on this film which was a comedy the film was in making for 3 years and released finally in 1994 but didn't work for some reason before this film, damini(93) released and did well the film is a mad comic film like most priyadarshan films nowdays but it is funny and well handled the film has a proper plot unlike today's films and makes you laugh most characters became famous, be it crime master gogo(shakti kapoor), paresh rawal and othersthe film keeps you laughing throughout it's run time though being too slapstick and overdone yet it's one of the funniest filmsdirection by rks is very good music is goodamongst actors aamir steals the show and delivers his funniest performance, this was his first out n out comedy salman does well but looks amateur front of aamir, yet does a good job and their chemistry is delightful karisma is annoying and sounds like a child raveena is adequate paresh rawal is too funny in both roles, shakti kapoor is hilarious in his over the top act shehzad khan(dubbed by ajit) is very good and viju khote too is funny rest all are good too

andaz apna apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time.both aamir and salman khan have acted brilliantly while aamir's acting was far better than salman.aamir khan is known as 'mr. perfectionist' in bollywood and he proves it in every of his film.the story moves around two young guys amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) both are from poor families and are a big dreamer.they want to become rich without bearing any pain.so when they hear about raveena bajaj (raveena tandon) daughter of mr.bajaj(paresh rawal) who comes to india to find his bridegroom , they both fool their fathers to marry raveena bajaj and the journey begins.there is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny.paresh rawal is in double role (teja and mr. bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as he always does.shakti kapoor (crime master gogo) also adds a great comedy.this movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of bollywood.

it is the best movie released in bollywood upto date. the best comedy, the best acting and the best direction till now! rajkumar santoshi's writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. aamir khan was absolutely amazing, salman khan looked good the way he acted. shakti kapoor was good, but jagdeep over acted as usual! this comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again! even rajkumar santoshi hasn't been able to make this cult classic again! this movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people.star.acting 10/10.dialogues 10/10.screenplay 10/10.direction 10/10.music 9/10.lyrics 9/10.overall, this movie is strongly recommended. if you didn't watch it till now, you missed something big! it is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date! classic films like hera pheri, golmaal and jaane bhi do jaaro are not even half as funny as this.great movie, hats off!!!!

i love this film. shehzad khan's portrayal as bhalla a.k.a. "shut up, robert!" was so hilarious. whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. viju khote is the dumbfounded robert a.k.a. "rabbit". i love that shakti kapoor a.k.a. "crime master gogo". paresh rawal's double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as ramgopal bajaj & shyamgopal bajaj. raveena tandon and karishma kapoor are out of this world. my brother does a really good mimicry of bhalla saying. "relax. please relax." i love the scene in which aamir khan puts a laxative in salman "muscles" khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times.

well to start with rajkumar santoshi is not a comedy film maker ,and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece.this film is really funny .loud in bits ,overacted in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun . story line in simple a billionaire's daughter come to india for marriage and two young chaps r behind her ,the story has a twist as well with a connection of a gangster .aamir playing a street smart guy amar has played his role with brilliance and salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection.raveena has done fine ,but karshima really turns irritating in some sequences .but real show stealer r paresh rawal and shakti kapoor ,they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing . overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no. of times without getting bored.

the best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it. i have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time. i have great liking for good comics like the orgazmo,cheech n chong, monty python series and many others but this one in hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. some of them recently in hindi are golmaal,munnabhai series and herapheri series. so all i can say is hind comedy is finally evolving. but andaaz apna apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above. its what i call the hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in hindi cinema.cheers to rajkumar santoshi for the brilliant movie.

i watched this movie probably more than 20 times. the jokes are now 10-15 years old but every time i watch it it makes me fall off my chair. two of the finest actor salman khan and aamir khan plays the lead roles here. even if aamir khan is a much better actor and got the better role(smart guy) in the movie salman khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy. all the characters are memorable. this movie is filled with hilarious one-liners and funny situations(a little too silly probably). don't try to look for logic in this movie. let your brain relax for some time. i promise it will be an experience to remember.

the first time i watched it was when it came out (1994), and the last time i watched it was just before writing this review.. it still makes me laugh my brains out...after all these years,it dose not disappoint. truly the smartest bollywood comedy ever made. this is one indian movie which deserves its place in the imdb top 250. aamir khan and salman khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. the thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing...the jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. this is one film truly ahead of its time. if you haven't seen it yet go watch it now !!!!!!!!!

aaa is my favorite movie... i have seen it a number of times (don't remember the count now) and every time i just love it.... this is the best movie of raj kumar santoshi..the comedy, dialogues, and performance is amazing.. all the actors and actresses have done a superb job... you cannot stop laughing while watching this movie... its just hilarious... amir khan and salman khan have done a great job... and acting by paresh rawal was excellent as always..... the music is inspired from the old hindi movies (60s music) and is good...the entire cast of the movie has done great job... overall its a great indian comedy movie to watch...

rajkumar santoshi tries his hands at comedy and succeeds. one of the few good movies that involves salman khan. a very funny movie from start to finish. all the characters contribute to the movie and believe me, there are a lot of them. aamir khan, salman khan, raveena tandon, karishma kapoor, paresh rawal, viju khote, jagdip, deven verma, shakti kapoor, harish patel, tiku talsania and more. the direction, editing, sound are not up to par, but that still does not matter, because the actors more than make up for that part.

a hilariously funny movie! of course u gotta have a sense of humour to be able to appreciate it. the music is excellent, reminded me of 50-60's hindi music which is a rarity nowadays... worth the $$$! go check it out :)

this movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles. after 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this.

i find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating. it is arguably one of the best comedies ever made, and surely the best bollywood comedy of the 90s. the film did not do too well on the box office and people had diametrically opposite reactions after seeing it. my guess is most people didn't expect it to be an all-out comedy and were expecting a regular movie. if you love comedies, this is a must-see. and aamir khan is outstanding.

the movie andaz apna apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in bollywood perhaps even hollywood. when the movie released i was a 8 year old and i heard it was a flop but i never understood till now why was it a flop...but let me tell you one thing...this movie would have more money by selling home cassettes and dvds and by showing in tv movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. this movie has been shown countless times in movie channels and i think even now the public love and the tv producers keep repeating the movie again and again. i personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and i still love it.....the performance by both aamir khan as amar and salman khan as prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....amar and prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and amars father is a barber. then they both get a news that a millionaire 's daughter from london is coming to india to look for a suitable match ...both amar and prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich.....therefore they both head out to woo raveena tandon..(the millionaires daughter)......in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry raveena.....the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing.......and then there is raveenas uncle (millionaire's look alike brother) teja who wants to take revenge from raveenas father.....since he is broke and raveenas dad is a millionaire......his plans include kidnapping raveena to blackmail raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers.....but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie (watch the movie to know).......then there is shakti kapoor as crime master gogo who is also incredibly funny......the thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts.....aamir khan uses his "aaila " brilliantly and salman goes like "ooima "........and for gogo there is " jab raat ko bacha soota nahi hain to ma bolti hain ki sooja nahi to gogo aa jaega" ......each and every scene is so funny......i especially liked the one in which aamir khan and salman goto get raveena from teja and they both go in a luna having "chillar" money in a bag....that scene is so funny..i recommend anyone who understands hindi or urdu to watch this movie ......this is one movie that i would recommend having a dvd and you will never regret.......

i can't disagree with a previous comment that "driving lessons" is more than a little twee, but one man's indictment is another's endorsement, i suppose. in my book this film succeeds on pure charm, no small feat in itself.i can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway. julie walters' dame evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress. though evie hasn't had steady work in years, it's unclear the last time she visited reality, if ever (think edina from "abfab" at 65, at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitsch-factor). some may find her annoying, but i think that's the point, to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved ben's (rupert grint) buttons to force him out of his shell. ben is equally isolated from reality, living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, who laura linney manages to breath some life into, despite being a fairly one-dimensional character (ye olde overbearing religious mom). i was rather impressed with rupert grint who i found to give a very honest and believable performance (not to mention sweet as all get-out), i can't think of many teen actors today for whom i can say that.the heart of the movie is what happens when ben and evie's worlds collide. at first ben is understandably tentative, but also intrigued, as evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything he's ever known. with the combination of evie's persistence and ben's helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them, culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives ben his first real taste of independence.the tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a credit to the main actors. all in all i'd say that if you're willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances, "driving lessons" shouldn't disappoint. however, if "cute" is not in your movie vocabulary, best to stay away.one other minor note, the soundtrack features the music of sufjan stevens prominently, a nice touch.

i saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if tartan films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that's generally a good sign, however i'm not normally a fan of julie walters, generally disliking her comedy roles (sorry to any fans, but it's a personal thing - i just don't find her funny in comedy).this was magnificent though - a great performance by all, but grint and walters are exceptional! plenty of laughs, plenty of pathos, great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film wouldn't normally be something i'd expect to like so much but i can't recommend this highly enough - and watch rupert grint as he matures into a fine fine actor.

i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts, and to be honest, i didn't know how much i would like it. i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised. driving lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly. he's definitely one to look out for in the future. dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters. i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. the highlight of the film, for me was evie's rather colourful poem. it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. in my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. the scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, i strongly disagree with

a british twist on harold and maude, driving lessons features a reined-in rupert grint and an over-the-top julie walters. while it is true that grint is stone-faced like a redheaded benjamin braddock for the first half of the movie, it does not deter from the quirky family film--there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction. the chemistry between walters and grint carries the film, though laura linney's hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable. these performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like sufjan stevens, john renbourn and salsa celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a saturday afternoon.

i just saw this movie at the tribeca film festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing. the combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. the movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. the seventeen year old, ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. it is very comical and touching. i honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies. i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. if you didn't catch one of the showings at the film festival, it's supposed to come out in theaters later in the year. please go see it! it is a great film.

well, i'm an italian horror big fan and i love movies from directors such argento, fulci, bava sr and bava jr, only to quote the most famous. "la villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director carlo ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price italian directors have to pay to not work in rome...) . but the film is not so bad. and it's absolutely not correct to talk about "trash". ok, the plot is not so original; it reminds me stuff like the amytville series (the year is the same of "amityville possession" by damiano damiani) or "shock", the last work of mario bava. but you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer (like mario bava movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement. the rest remain in the background. i think the movie works; not so good, but works; it's surely better than a lot of hollywoodian production like "the haunting" which have a bigger budget, but not bigger ideas...

one of eastwood's best movies after he had separated himself from the westerns. which in themselves were good whenever i had a chance to see any of clint's earlier work i would sit in front of the set and watch whatever was on.

this film was a surprise. the plot synopsis sounds kinky, and stars clint eastwood and the great geraldine page. i didn't know what to expect. there is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering, and very adult, mouth to mouth kiss. the child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives. he takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the headmistress, played by page, her assistant and another student. jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue, and the macabre all meld in this wonderfully original story.i've read the other comments here and find little to disagree with. however, i wanted to clarify a point made earlier that there are no sympathetic characters in the film. i find that there is one. the attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it touches upon the common history of black women slaves taken advantage of by white men. even though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience, she is what i would consider a sympathetic character. she, more than any of the other women and girls at the school, has a legitimate reason for participating in what happens in the end.

this movie is not what it appears to be. clint eastwood is not dirty harry or a "cowboy" here. the movie's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme. it's a gothic tale set in the civil war and as such all the film's "action", or lack thereof, takes place inside a house populated by southern belles of all ages and shapes.the horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the clint eastwood character. seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very "beguiling" experience indeed. and who is "beguiled" here exactly? are the women beguiled by eastwood's incredible looks? are we, the viewers, beguiled by both his sexual allure and the potential deviant sexualities it unleashes? or does "beguiled" refer to what the director does here-- holds us enthralled for a short space only to (maybe)let us go? don siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films i had the pleasure of watching.

clint eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and he's taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to confederate soldiers. seems that the women-folk at this place have ulterior motives. geraldine paige, the headmistress, justifies not turning him into the confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin. of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the lady's man and is pretty much making the rounds, but when he gets busted he really gets busted, in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off, but it's for his own good, of course, not out of retribution. things get carried a bit further though when certain women don't get what they want. i haven't seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by today's standards is still pretty strange. not typical eastwood at all. if you haven't seen this one it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.

this super creepy southern gothic melodrama stars clint eastwood as a wounded confederate officer in the civil war who's taken in by a rural girls' school and nursed back to health. a weird clash of genders ensues, with the supposedly "dangerous" male falling prey to a batch of seemingly harmless women, who prove themselves to be every bit as brutal as the men waging war on one another at the battle fronts. this is a classic spider and the fly story, but here there's one lone fly and a whole bunch of spiders.geraldine page plays the head mistress of the school, and she gives a characteristically sensational performance. page was trained as a theater actress, and it shows in all of her performances. no matter what role she played, she always committed herself 100% to it, and never once let herself drop out of character. so it is here, with this lethal spinster, who takes her sexual repression out on this helpless man. each of the other girls responds to him in her own particular way as well. the two most prominent are the slutty girl who can't wait to throw throw herself at him, and the virginal one (played by who else but the mannered elizabeth hartman?) who acts like she would fall over in a dead faint if someone so much as said the word "penis" to her. the schematic madonna and the whore storyline would seem heavy-handed if the movie didn't keep you so off-kilter and so completely unsure of what was going to happen next.the most memorable scene in the film for me occurred when the group of women perform an amputation of eastwood's leg, which has become infected with gangrene. again, the spider/fly allusion is clear: they hobble him so that it's that much harder for him to escape their web.a classic chiller. not a great film, but a morbidly entertaining one.grade: a-

a buster keaton silent short.poor buster becomes the goat ("scapegoat") for a dangerous escaped murderer.this is a wonderful, hilarious little film with keaton at his absolute best. in what is essentially a series of chases, buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. big joe roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.born into a family of vaudevillian acrobats, buster keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. an association with fatty arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928. writer, director, star & stuntman - buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience. more akin to fairbanks than chaplin, buster's films were full of splendid adventure, exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable. his theme of a little man against the world, who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity, dominates his films. through every calamity & disaster, buster remained the great stone face, a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad.in the late 1920's buster was betrayed by his manager/brother-in-law and his contract was sold to mgm, which proceeded to nearly destroy his career. teamed initially with jimmy durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies, buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent. finally, before lung cancer took him at age 70, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered. now, well past his centenary, buster keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses. and he knew how to make people laugh...

director don siegel really impressed me with this film. it is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer. i didn't know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70's soft-core peddling with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south. but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are likable by the film's end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic. eastwood plays cpl. mcburney, a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin(you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war - particularly in the south. soon, page, teacher elizabeth hartman, lovely, young seductress carol, and even ferdin(amy)have emotional/sexual ties to eastwood - each having their own needs and secrets and problems. eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. the beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. this might be(except for invasion of the body snatchers) siegel's best film. it certainly is one of eastwood's best real performances. page is always so very good and hartman, fe5rdin, et al excellent. the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic. some of the sexual-laced scenes disturbing. and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented film.

it is hard to know what category to put this film in, most films set in this time period of us history are westerns but here instead of the wide open plains of the west the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic girls boarding school in louisiana.the film opens with amy, a young girl, walking though the woods picking mushrooms, as she does so she stumbles upon corporal john 'mcbee' mcburney, a wounded union soldier, who she takes back to the school. we know that he isn't a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a passing confederate patrol even though she told him she was twelve.once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest, some think they should look after him till his wounds are healed while others believe that it is treason not to hand him over to confederate forces at the first opportunity. the former group prevail and he gradually recovers. as he does so his presence has an effect on all of the girls who haven't had a man on site for a long time, including a young teacher and the head mistress who's previous relationship appears to have been with her own brother. mcbee sets about seducing them, emotionally if not physically, this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls.while this film is rated fifteen it is definitely not for younger viewers both for the sexual content, of which little is actually shown but much is implied, and for a very gruelling scene which had me squirming more than any other scene in any film i've seen for quite some time. it is interesting to see clint eastwood play against type, instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and for most of the time at the mercy of the women around him. the acting is solid throughout, not just from eastwood but also from all the actresses, including the young pamelyn ferdin who played amy.

it took me years to finally catch this gem of a film and it was worth the wait. in nearly all of his films clint always plays the hero. be it hero, anti-hero or avenging hero. in this film he is pure villain and he plays it well.as a wounded union soldier he is brought into a confederate girls school by the students and teachers to heal. soon after he begins to seduce the ladies no matter their age and some are quite young. he also plays upon their jealousies and pits them against each other. in the end you are never so happy to see clint die a terrible death.that is what makes this film such a gem. clint has never done any other film like it and after seeing this film you wish he had. he plays the role of the villain so well it will make you wonder why he never did any more films like it. it also explains why the film is not seen very often. most people don't want to see clint as the villain and with dirty harry being released shortly after this film it has become a hidden gem. if you are a clint eastwood fan you owe it to yourself to see this film. you might not like what you will see but you won't soon forget it.

buster keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films, and they don't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem. the dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon. this leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the "wanted" signs. the goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene at the bread queue, right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. a keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking, as sound is never something you needed with him. his movies explain themselves through the wonderful (yet incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself. it isn't hard to see just how influential he really was - the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in 1921.

a fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural/political aura of the late 60s (taking in the class struggle as well) which, ironically, in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views, makes full use of the permissiveness that prevailed for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it purports to criticize! norman wexler's incisive oscar-nominated script is superbly enacted by peter boyle (in a powerhouse performance) who manages to make his garrulous, down-to-earth yet hypocritical and opportunistic character (with a barely-disguised fascist streak which comes to the fore in the remarkable violent conclusion) likable, even admirable; indeed, he comes across uncannily like a flabbier version of the young marlon brando! similar to other generation gap movies of its era like taking off (1971) and hardcore (1978) but also nihilistic vigilante films like death wish (1974) and taxi driver (1976) - interestingly enough, two of these also feature boyle - joe ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm...

peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun-ho bigot, making me hate him everytime he used the "n" word, i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out. ( just think, peter boyle was a monk once) (now a supporting actor in "everybody loves raymond") susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water. i noticed a large raggerty ann doll(creator, john gruelle) was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes. if you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, then, enjoy the excellent direction of john g. avildsen ("rocky and "the karate kid") i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end!! this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.

this is a wonderful comedy short--one of keaton's absolute best. through a long series of silly mistakes, buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. and, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular. while generally i am not a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. i have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace. in particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible. plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone. by the way, this film is very similar to cops, also by keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.this film is brilliant and the only keaton short i can think of that i probably liked even more was the playhouse--where buster plays every role at the theater.

i really liked the movie "joe." it has really become a cult classic among certain age groups.the producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine. he is my stepsons father-in-law. he lives in manhattan's west side, and has a bungalow. in southampton, long island. his son-in-law live next door to his bungalow.presently, he does not do any producing, but dabbles in a business with hbo movies.as a person, mr. gil is a real gentleman and i wish he would have continued in the production business of move making.

joe is the movie about the dark side of the force of the 1960's in america, and susan sarandon had nice boobs. this movie scared me so much when i saw it in the theatre that i never liked peter boyle until young frankenstein and was still quite leery of him even after that comedy. looking back now from today's experience, this film seems current again in being direct and to the point of half the electorate's approval of john mccain's "joe the plumber" typecast and their fear of electing a black man as president of the usa in the coming weeks. a black prez would be seen as sweet revenge of the "niggers" but bound to again bring fire to many minds if not the streets, this time by joe enthusiasts. so, the spirit of joe in the film is resurrected in the campaign of joe the plumber! still, i love to be american and be terrified at both and by the knowledge that they illustrate what ironically gregory peck said our civilized law also is: "a living, breathing reality!" god help us.

dennis patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. joe (peter boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. instead of calling the cops or the like, joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! he blackmails the man into becoming his pal. at first, the film seemed harsh and judgemental, but, as it revealed itself, it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society. yes, i think it does exaggerate a bit, but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages. susan sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. well worth seeing.

saw this for the first time on uk tv, with good musical accompaniment. the elevator scene is class, especially when he does the going-down thing in the phone booth, and then fiddles with the floor-indicator. the jump through the transom is really impressive, and there's so much more. apart from all the stuff that's been mentioned before, there's the fight with the man who's been bullying the woman with the dog - it just looks so simple. the only drawback is the plot - he gets mixed up with dead eye dan, who then escapes but doesn't reappear, even when some more gangsters get involved later on. the scene where it looks like he's shooting at the fat inspector is funny, but would have been better if dead eye was the one pulling the trigger.

i don't care if some people voted this movie to be bad. if you want the truth this is a very good movie! it has every thing a movie should have. you really should get this one.

let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune into a post 1990 corey feldman film, there are probably boobs, guns and cars. saying that, there is more to this movie than just naked ladies (i'm sorry to say), cos it's mainly people getting themselves killed in a variety of unusual, and as the name suggests, often 'mystical' ways. i love crappy horror, and i love this film. if you don't, you probably wont. but i think it's worth most people giving it a go, it's not so crappy that it'll ruin your weekend or anything. all in all, if its mindless good fun, a bit of corpse loving, and an 80's childhood superstar your in the mood for, then you've come to the right place. its a cracker!!!!

there is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail. think of that conman's conman w.c.fields in the old fashioned way, or the marx brothers in a night at the opera, or chaplin in the adventurer, of mae west in she done him wrong. the skirting of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic. think of lloyd in his first talkie, welcome danger, trying to "assist" the san francisco police department in the midst of a crime wave, and making police sergeant edgar kennedy want to kill him. think of laurel and hardy as ill-fated cops in midnight patrol. i find this type of hostility is so patent in all these giants' (and their peers') comedy that even a fake title for a film deals with it. think of jerry seinfeld in one episode of his series creating a three stooges short, sappy pappies, where the boys end up being electrocuted for murder.buster keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies. look at steamboat bill, jr., where he tries to spring his dad from a calaboose. but he actually had more conflict from police forces in his shorts. in convict 13 he is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict. in cops (perfect title - if you see it you'd understand) the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for keaton, mistaken for a terrorist). and in the goat he is unable to avoid the police for most of the film.keaton is a tramp just looking for food. but he is totally unlucky. when he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe (which keaton earlier ignored) over his shoulder, and then find a wallet full of money, keaton tries the same thing, and hits a cop in the head. the cop gives chase, and keaton (as luck would have it) runs into another cop, tries to act normal, but ends by throwing the other cop into the path of the first. soon he has three cops chasing him. briefly shaking them he walks by a window at the local jail where local murderer "dead shot dan" (malcolm st. clair*) is being photographed. passing in back of the barred windows, keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in. the desperado notes this and ducks as the picture is taken. when dead shot flees the police, it is keaton's face on all the wanted posters.(*st. clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies, although in his later biography would be a stint at 20th century fox where his work with laurel & hardy was below par.)keaton flees to another town by train (disconnecting the passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and tender). this is the film (by the way) that has two famous keaton jokes. his arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant shot, with it coming closer and closer, and suddenly the audience sees keaton sitting on the cowcatcher. the second famous sequence goes later (and may have influenced chaplin somewhat in the beginning of city lights). keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog (virginia fox). when he sees the poster's calling him a murderer he thinks he killed the man. he is being chased in this town by a suspicious chief of police (joe roberts), and momentarily loses roberts in the park. a statue of "man-of-war" is being constructed and the sculptor is unveiling a clay model of the horse). keaton is seen seated on the clay model, trying to maintain his dignity as the clay legs of the horse start collapsing under his weight. keaton manages to meet the pretty ms fox, who invites him home for dinner. only he doesn't realize her father is roberts. the last five minutes of the film deal keaton fleeing and avoiding roberts while he and fox get away together.it's a funny comedy, and a wonderful example of keaton's work at his best.

vanaja is a film of superlatives. it has an exceptionally well thought-out cast with mamatha being the crowning jewel, a superb production and possibly pre-production with rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey of rural southern india through the eyes of a 15 year old, a remarkable mixture of song and dance, traditional and modern, blended perfectly, and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. what a towering achievement for a debut director!! the casting was absolutely dead-on. i wish india would come out with more of such films. this film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life. 9/10.

winning 26 out of the 28 awards it was nominated for, there is no doubt that this film will stand as one of the best of 2007. the fact that it was made with non professionals who were trained to act and dance makes it that much more special.it is not a bollywood production, but it is about art. a lower caste girl wants to sing and dance. she wants to move up in society, but there is a limit. everyone cannot be president in india, there is a caste system, and the narrow minds will not allow it to be breached.vanaja (mamatha bhukya) quits school at 15 and goes to work for the landlady (urmila dammannagari), who was once an accomplished dancer. after some time working the animals, she is taught to sing and dance. the film is strikingly beautiful with rich color. it is amazing what can be done with $20,000, as this film was a master's project for the writer director.the landlady's son (karan singh) returns from america to run for office and is struck by the girl. but, she is lower caste and can only be a vessel for his lust. things are no better at home as her father drinks and eats and steals her money. she ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the landlady.in the end, she never rises above her caste, but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.

this is not your typical indian film. there is some great sense of humanity, and the characters are pretty realistic. there is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, grief, passion, passivity among the many characters. while seeing this, one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. the final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization, and yet, human relations are still preserved and nurtured. saw it on dvd, the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well (or not being shown) in india (... but maybe not too surprised). the artistic patrimony of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations, as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today. great film.

vanaja (2006), written and directed by rajnesh domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from south india. mamatha bhukya plays 15-year-old vanaja, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. if she is going to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty. i went to the film expecting the depiction of an wretched girl who is crushed by society. this isn't what "vanaja" shows us. the young woman is attractive, intelligent, and ambitious. she won't accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. she wants to succeed, and it's never clear that she won't succeed, despite the odds. the acting that mr. domalpalli draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous. mamatha bhukya is outstanding in the title role, and urmila dammannagari does an exceptional job as mrs. rama devi, the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancer.in the film vanaja learns south indian classical dance, as she did in real life. i couldn't tell how good vanaja's dancing was by indian standards, but the many dance scenes were spellbinding. (don't think bollywood--this is classical dance. it's also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor. in sound indian dance, the heel is the primary contact point.)this is a movie that is not to be missed. it will work on dvd, but will be better on a theater screen because the dancing will be shown to better advantage. however, if dvd is your only option, then see it that way. just be sure to see it.

"on our own" is a touching story of four kids who run away from foster home after their mother dies, with only one suitcase, their dog ralph and $9 they set off in their mums old car in search of their uncle jack. on the way their car breaks down and they meet peggy williams, a schoolteacher on holidays and she offers to help them out. together she and the children search for uncle jack but are forced to hide from the authorities that plan to take them back into foster care as they do so. this film tells a story of love, friendship and how important it is to stick with your family as the children venture out on their amazing journey.

the commenter before me stated this movie is the worst that was ever forced upon him/her as a child. i have to say though that i loved this movie when was little and i still love it today. the movie has the best running theme of all-family togetherness. considering the time period the movie was released i thought the movie was acted out well. i only wish i could still find a copy of it somewhere!! of all the 1980's films i watched as a kid this was on of my favorites. i know i probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and my mom. i would definitely recommend it to anyone i know-or don't know. so if you do find a copy of it i suggest watching it! it's wonderful and heartwarming.

it's really too bad that nobody knows about this movie. i think if it were just spruced up a little and if it weren't so low-budget, i think one of the major film companies might have wanted to take it. i first saw this movie when i was 11, and i thought it was so powerful with the many great, yet illegal lengths that mitchell goes to just to keep his family together. it inspired me then and it amazes me now. if you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!

my cousins and i have watched this movie ever since we were little. i don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is. the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch. it is an old movie but don't let that fool you. this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.

this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time. we have been on a keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films. in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster - his creativity. the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there.

alexander nevsky is rightfully held up as a cinematic masterpiece. it has however aged very badly. people decide not to mention this and talk about the great battles and the great music. the sound effects may have been good then but apart from the foreboding organ all the sounds are risible. i may be shot by film buffs for this but i'm sure the modern viewer of alexander nevsky will agree that the blatant propaganda and the appalling music to detract from the film. i gave this film 10/10 because it is undeniably a master piece. it does have its great bits however. the costumes of the teutonic knights are superb and the battle scenes are fairly good for the time.it is however a master piece that is showing it's age.

"alexander nevsky" marked director sergei eisenstein's return to film-making after a period of exile, and what he produced is a bald-faced propaganda film proclaiming russia's superiority over germany.there's very little plot: russians unite to battle germans; russia wins. the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed in with some moments of german brutality (like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire). this was eisenstein's first sound film, and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. indeed, this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added. there are some dialogue scenes, but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen, and the pacing is all off, as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them. eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing prokofiev score over the proceedings, and indeed, that's one of the film's biggest assets.say what you will about eisenstein's ability (or lack of) to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and "alexander nevsky" over all shines through its deficiencies.grade: a

to my eternal shame, i've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, "nosferatu". however, if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from buster keaton then i'll probably try to watch a few more. this is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. the premise, such as it is, focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy dead shot dan (co-director malcolm st clair). this leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate keaton.you're left amazed and entertained in equal measures. keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt-man, judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like jackie chan on speed. and the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard - my better half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much! if you've never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch - it certainly blew away any ideas i may have had about silent films. naturally, it isn't as polished as today's movies - the acting is pretty awful, truth be told but that doesn't matter because you're enjoying the movie regardless. anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed. brilliant!

not all, but most of this story is buster being mistaken for "dead shot dan," a notorious criminal. there really is no story, just a series of adventures to show off buster's physical talents, which are amazing, and his comedic timing. the 27-minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero.earlier, it's a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later it's "big joe" roberts, a rotund cop - and father a girl buster is interested in - who chases him. those latter scenes were the best i thought, with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live. that was keaton at his best.it's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense, but cares? it's buster at his slapstick best, or near it, and so it serves its purpose: to entertain us. just think: 85 years after this film was made there are people (like me) still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics! cool!

this metro film is episodic, but nearly a constant series of chases, mainly trying to escape police, whether real or imagined, as buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal. it is consistently inventive and entertaining. its greatest value is in its documenting what hollywood looked like in the early twenties, since 95% of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time. one gem moment and one gem sequence are present here.the great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it - with buster glumly sitting on the cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close-up within seconds.the great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator - one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor - one of the great keaton gags.kino's print is sharp and clear - almost pristine. there is a violin/piano score accompaniment. this is one to seek out and enjoy.

i'm a petty officer 1st class (e-6) and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard. there were only a few scenes that were far fetched. the most far-fetched was when po fischer (kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. second, the command center (supposedly in kodiak), it looked more like a nasa command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech. third, the captain of the airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch. in reality it would be an e-6 or e-7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller & a radio watchstander. otherwise the movie was dead on, i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search & rescue instead of just aviation based rates. some of the scenes from "a" school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days.

i really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. i've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--i have yet to watch the schumacher films again). i'm also starting to become concerned about whether i'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. you see, i always liked the schumacher films. as far as i can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. but the conventional wisdom is that the two tim burton directed films are far superior. i had serious problems with the first burton batman this time around--i ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as i might, i just couldn't help feel that batman returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.but burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, batman returns is still a great film, especially if you're a burton fan, as batman returns has just as much in common with the nightmare before christmas (1993) and edward scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the batman universe.the film begins strongly, with the cobblepots having a baby. we see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. later, they have the baby in a small cage. finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the gotham city river. the baby ends up becoming batman villain the penguin (danny devito).meanwhile, max shreck (christopher walken) is the film's "evil capitalist", comparable to grissom (jack palance) in batman. he is planning on duping gotham city in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid selina kyle (michelle pfeiffer). when kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming catwoman.while all of this is going on, the penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.before re-watching burton's batman films this time, i didn't remember just how little the films are about batman (michael keaton). it's almost as if burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. the focus here is much more on the villains, especially the penguin. batman doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching the penguin.although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, i can't say that i do, even if i'd like to know more about batman and follow his story more. the villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an "origin story" for two major batman villains, batman returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.however, there are some character problems that i do count as a flaw. the penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in tod browning's freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as vincent schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.for that matter, he hardly has space to explore catwoman. the film plays as if catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. so the bulk of the catwoman scenes had to be excised. of course, all of this barely leaves any room for batman. burton has batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. as far as we know, at the end, gothamites still think that batman is a murdering lunatic. that's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.as for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that burton and writers sam hamm and daniel waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. a lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). it helps to look at batman returns as a more "poetic" film, as i believe was the intention. this also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well."dark" is the easiest way to sum up batman returns in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. anyone who knows me knows that i love dark. so for me, burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. in many ways, batman returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. like batman, burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of vertigo (1958) and star wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight star wars reference), he invokes films like nosferatu (1922) (including that "max schreck" was the name of the actor who played the dracula-like character there), motel hell (1980), the aforementioned freaks, willy wonka and the chocolate factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in the penguin's final scene.in terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general "feel" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.

tim burton the man behind the original batman film and beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. firstly michelle pfeiffer and danny de vito are a great mix of batmans enemies. the dark, deadly and sexy catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. the sets are stunning and immaculate. gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. the only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. tim burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. beats all the superman films and the other batman films by a mile. though in terms of realisation the new batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but burton is a more original director than nolan.

i don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. i really don't. dark -yes, bizarre - no. it i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the pinguin's story. they say it has elements of s&m but i really don't find anything of that sort except for catwoman's whip.this movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. they have strong motives with strong feelings involved. catwoman (a great performance by michelle pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by danny devito). again, i think michael keaton is the best batman and he carries his costume well.you can totally see that it is a tim burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. but also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.

when precious bane aired in america, i was stunned by this beautiful story. all the actors were brilliant; clive owen really understood the character he played. i went right away to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which is even more beautiful, and which went out of print just after i bought the book - although i've seen it online a few times now. i had also hoped with the oscar won by janet mcteer and the huge popularity of clive owen the bbc would naturally get this fine production on dvd...i cannot believe all these years later we still have no dvd. it has to be the only production ever created by the bbc that is not for sale. come on bbc - you have money to make off us fans here. get this on dvd please!

having known and loved this book since i was eleven i was terrified to see it coming up as a movie - what if they'd made a dreadful mess of it? in the event i needn't have worried at all. everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific, it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison, which to me added nothing at all. however it really is the most beautiful love story and i'm so glad i videoed it so i can watch it again and again. my only gripe is - why didn't they give kester a green waistcoat 'which made him such a personable man'? such a simple thing, when they went to so much trouble for everything else. if you get the chance, see this, it is excellent.

just reading the reviews of this wonderful bbc mini series reminded me how much i enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago. at the time i remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with john bowe and janet mcteer ,two talented actors that we don't see enough of on tv or cinema these days. i have tried without success to obtain several of the bbcs fantastic dramas from the past, including the 1973 version of jane eyre and the 1972 version of anne of green gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories, which sadly the bbc seem to have no intention of releasing on video or dvd. if anyone learns otherwise i would love to hear from them.in the meantime we will have to content ourselves with our recollections of how wonderful they were.

hi i am john and i would like to tell you all that my dog was in this film at the baiting screen he was the pit like one, that was going to bite the man chained up. my dogs name was colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this film. he was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts. he won some dog shows but he has passed away now i miss him he was a great, true and loyal dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer which could not be treated so i had to get him put down that was the worst day of my life i hope this gives you some thing to look for in the film if you watch it again.thanks all

this is a great tv miniseries of a classic novel. janet mcteer and john bowe, in the lead roles, are exceptional. this is one of the best adaptations from a book that i have seen. i would love to get a copy of this - let me know if you know how i might get one...thanks!

"walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. kenneth branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. the script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. the music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. the scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply astounding effects. this is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too.in conclusion, this is a must watch. not only did i love this, but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen. if anything, it could have done with being longer, other than that this is perfect. 10/10 bethany cox

and quite frankly that just sums it up.it is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal documentory....the animation is almost flawless (i thought the long necked swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake).however some of the model shots didn't look quite that realistic...and i thought that jurrassic park made a better t rex..if this is the type of thing we see on a normal british tv series then i cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies..i give this 10/10 stars...(and the "making of" video was also great.....the dinosaur on the skate board was halarious)<..>

as john grierson pointed out: "the documentary genre can be defined like this: the creative interpretation of reality"this fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time a computer-generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer.when i saw jurassic park, which i was expecting with great excitement, i was left extremely disappointed. of course the dinosaurs were great, but the story-telling was unnecessary. i thought: "what if they made a documentary on dinosaurs, with no crying children or bad puns, just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible, to let us marvel at what was once reality."my dream came true. the bbc has produced an exhilarating documentary exploring the different eras of the dinosaurs.this part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior, skin patterns etc: of course they have to. nobody was there. i think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that. the guessings are all based on the knowings of many paleontologists, and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like. if you wanna stick to what we know for sure, then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum. that is why i incorporated the grierson quote at the beginning of this comment.anyway, hats off to the creators of it.

i saw this series in 1999 in london tv and was blown away. like another user commented - this is what i would have liked to see when i first watched "jurassic park" - life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. the cg are very lifelike, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational.the series takes everything factually known about dinosaurs, adds a lot of good ideas on "what it could have been" to make up what then looks like a documentary series. what i missed was some small bar-graph constantly in one corner of the screen, moving between "fiction" and "fact" along with the narration and the pictures, because you often wonder how much is educated guessing, and how much is pure fantasy.to some clues on facts & fiction, you have to see the 50 minute "making of", which is not only very educational about the cg process and collecting and including the paleontologists knowledge into the series, but which also is very funny (dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about cg animators).i highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming disney dinosaur movie or watching any jurassic park (like) movie again. it will surely make you much more critical towards those movies. the disney trailers looked especially bad.

for those that are great fans and collectors of dinosaurs like i am, it is not only a very informative series but also puts our imagination to fly. colors, composition, great models and camera angles. fantastic photography and filming presentation. superb. thanks.

this bbc series is excellent. i am no paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical representation of dinosaurs i have ever seen. the 3d animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe you have travelled back in time. the bbc deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series as well as tim haines who must have spent a great deal of time getting this series to air.

when jurassic park first came out, it was revolutionary in filmaking and special effects.for the first ever time people cold go to a dinosaur movie and be convinced they were looking at real dinosaurs brought to life.however whilst some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the real creatures could have been like (t.rex,brachiosaurus,triceratops etc)some were altered to fit the movie(velociraptor,dilophosaurus)and the film took place n the present on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats all those millions of years ago. the amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. now we can view sights such as a grim triassic desert,a whole herd of diplodocus, an icthyosaur give birth, a massive sea monster, a pterosaurs eye-view,dinosaurs thriving in the south pole, two torosaurus lock horns,t.rex roaring at the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled their doom. these dinosaurs walk,run,feed,fight,breed,hunt and swim. but the series also reveals the other creatures that they shared the world with,two episodes are mainly focused on two different kinds of animals, the flying pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived beneath the waves. the locations and scenery are spectacular and look all the more unique when a cg dino walks onto screen. and as for the cgi and animatronics, the movements of the cgi dinosaurs look totally and completely natural,the colouring is bright and vivid and the crewmen have taken careful steps to ensure that the cg animals interact with their environments in any way an actual creature would by making splashes in the water,brushing by bushes, kicking up dust and casting shadows on the ground. admittedly the cg isn't perfect with a few brief instances where the animals look too computery but the rest of the time it looks breathtaking. the puppetry is poor in some cases but it has its moments particularly the scene with the cynodonts in the first episode. the narration by kenneth branagh is pretty good as well giving us vital bits of information and drama at the same time. but of course the true pleasure is seeing a living dinosaur doing what they did all those years ago and also seeing some truly cute moments with cynodont(mammal/reptile hybrid)pups,sauropodlets(baby diplodocus)and t.rex chicks(yes even t.rex can be cute)and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and was even more so back then. all this adds up to a prehistoric nature masterpiece that lets you see a real dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the safety of your living room. if you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing visuals or just to have a truly good viewing and be entertained then walking with dinosaurs is definitely for you. easily recommended.

if you haven't seen this yet, you really should, on dvd. i can't believe how much i enjoyed it! it is amazingly realistic and believable. true, much of it is speculated, and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there aren't many of them), but it handles everything quite well with a "cruel mother nature" theme. it will remind you of the nature programs that you've seen on animal planet and the discovery channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. they act natural; they eat, kill, mate, play, and fight for survival. you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others.for the most part, the effects are excellent. at times they will look a little too much like cgi's, but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. in some cases, you will actually be convinced that you've seen a dinosaur. my favorites were the coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. i was most disappointed with the t-rex, however, which looked a little too computer generated at times.in any case, you should definitely see this production. it is educational, well made, and very entertaining. for what it is, its an a!

this is as good as it gets.this is six episodes tracing (briefly) what life may have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth. done in the style of a nature documentary this show does away with talking heads instead just gives us the good stuff with the dinosaurs attempting to survive.certainly this isn't a true documentary since none of what we see on screen can be attested to with any certainty, but its a best guess, and an entertaining one at that. here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people. this is a show that should be shown to any kid who loves dinosaurs since it will instill them with the oh wow factor to go out and find out more. it will also entertain the hell out of them, and you.see this. if you love animal shows or nature or science or disney true life adventures (except no one really gets killed) or just a really good trip to somewhere else run out and get yourself a copy. your brain will thank you.

walking with dinoasaurs is a new and exciting programme that uses amazing visual graphics to display the living dinosaurs. the information presented here is stunning. the moods in the series alter to get your attention, things such as dramatic music when fights break out. there is clear evidence here for one cracking documentary! my greatest thanx to the writers, directors and producers, and not forgetting the other people involved. if you stumble accross this video in shops i suggest you buy it not just for the graphics, but for the extreme efforts and productive work the series has to offer. 10/10

we bought the dvd of "walking with dinosaurs" and have been nearly ecstatic over the things that are done so very well on it.many dvds today offer the bare minimum ... the feature itself, and maybe one other language (which doesn't help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to see the dvd in multiple markets). not so in the case of wwd. there are so many wonderful extras and well-thought-out vignettes that watching even the *navigation menu* is interesting. the intros to each chapter in "the making of" dvd are laugh-out-loud funny. the quality of the sound and video is terrific. and of course the story and content ... what more could a dinosaur lover ask for?i did watch most of the version broadcast on tdc (narrated by avery brooks) then watched about half of the dvd (narrated by kenneth branaugh). as near as i can tell, the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly american slang terms in the narration (i.e. in a section about t. rex mating, branugh says "the female is tiring of the male's attention" and brooks says, "the honeymoon is over")and cut out some of the closer-in puppet work. i prefer the branugh version simply because it is more complete.overall, a great value and wonderful production. many kudos to the bbc and the crew that made this gem.

great "documentary" of how scientist's believed dinosaurs behaved, captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since "jurassic park". done completely seriously, like a prehistoric episode of "nation geographic". grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go. my favorite part was when the diplodocus fights off the allosauros.10 stars. this is what science is all about.

this documentary is absolutely fantastic. i was really astonished that you can make with so less money such amazing fx. especially the scenes of the birth of the diplodocus babies or the sad story of the big flying dinosaur were wonderful and breathtaking. well the only flaw was: it was to short!!

in wwii, america has developed a brand-new huge bomber plane. lois lane and clark kent go to cover the story when the plane is going on its first mission. lois stows away on the plane before it takes off. there are also some japanese saboteurs on board who have every intention of flying the bomber to tokyo. will lois be able to warn superman? what do you think?fast-moving, colorful cartoon. the animation is a little jerky but much better than anything we see today. the color and sound have been beautifully restored. just two problems--the lousy music score and the racism (especially in the title). that aside this is pretty good. an 8.

a superman cartoon.when america unveils its colossal new bomber, the japoteurs, an elite force of japanese spies & saboteurs, strikes. stealing the behemoth, with intrepid girl reporter lois lane aboard, and the destination either tokyo or destruction, it's time for superman to get involved...this was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by max fleischer for paramount studio. they feature great animation and taut, fast-moving plots. meant to be shown in movie theaters, they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts. bud collyer is the voice of superman; joan alexander does the honors for lois lane.

following the business coup of the year of 1941, max and dave, the brothers fleischer were removed from their own studio by paramount pictures corporation. former employees such as seymour kneitel and izzy sparber were put in charge of the new operation, now renamed famous studios by paramount. early on, the finished product of famous was indiscernible from that of the recent output by fleischer. the existing series (popeye, superman) continued as if nothing at all had transpired.today's subject, japoteurs is one of the earlier famous studio's superman shorts.as had been the custom, the superman cartoons were a great combination of fine, fittingly fashioned music in the score. that goes for the theme (overture) as well as all the multi-mood background (incidental) music. it was if each cartoon short had its own background music, as all was kept fresh by apparently recording it anew with each picture.with regards to japoteurs, we must remember that this was filmed during the first year of the united states' involvement and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotypical, short-handed and outright evil. the dialogue and personality of the villainous japanese saboteurs was strictly from the stock characters of the old pulp magazine stories, with their every word being said in a sarcastic, totally insincere politeness as the characters would flaunt their cold bloodedness as they made the most demonic of threats and outrageous acts toward the occidental world.japoteurs is visually bright and uplifting, stunningly laid out and makes use of some multi plane or table top animation in order to give its flying sequences a real depth.making good use of the tie-ins between the animated cartoons, the superman radio show then heard over the mutual broadcasting network; the cartoon bears a close resemblance to the comics page and uses the very same talents of voice actors bud collyer and joan alexander from the radio show.we rate it with a *** ¬Ω stars.poodle schnitz!!

spoilers ahead¬ó for the first ten minutes or so of star witness we're introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city, which is another way of saying warner brothers' version of nyc. except for the young children, including the charming dickie moore, and sprightly sally blane, they're a pretty dreary lot, and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star, walter huston. but wait, folks, wait. all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out, drawing the family in against their will, and after that this baby never lets up. there's suspense, an oscar-nominated script, good acting; everything you want old movies to be¬óit is here. i do question chic sales performance; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot. he's treated to special status in the credits, so warner bros. must have really been high on sale, but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me. perhaps it is lost to time period, an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand. also, the climax is typically melodramatic. nevertheless, this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far (however, i've only seen eight, so perhaps that's an inconclusive view). do not miss this when tcm shows it. 8 out of 10.

...our the grandpa's hour.more than the gangsters ,it's a detailed depiction of an american family circa 1930:the father,proud of his job who worries about his son who's given up high school,the mum everyone would like to have ,the daughter who forgets dinner time in his squeeze's arms,and the twins who are absolutely lovable ("don't go to sleep first ,please!").and there's the grandfather ,playing the yankee doodle on his flute .have you noticed that this tune plays the same role as doris day's "que sera sera" in hitchcock's "the man who knew too much" (1956)?and there's this grandpa who is finally the most courageous person of the family .so old he does not even tell you his age ,but proud of his country and resisting to the gangster's hateful blackmail.a good film by wellman.

charles "chic" sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the leeds family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant. he fought at bull run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high, even after his son-in-law is beaten and one of his grandson's is kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. he wouldn't want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway. the conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this oscar-nominated story. walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don't back up their identification of the killer in court. the rest of the cast, including the sleazy killer, ralph ince, are all excellent, and the film is snappily directed by william a. wellman. there's also good suspense, as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin.

this film, an early william wellman, has an important message, particularly today. it posits the notion that sometimes there are things more important than your own personal safty or well-being. the film, which has walter huston as the lead, is stolen by the performance of "chic" sales as grampa. he's the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch. you'll recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the '20's and '30's. wel worh your time to watch if you get the opportunity. recommended.

this is one of those films that looks so "dated" that being that way is part of the fun. you see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today. some of that is good; some it too corny for words, some of it bad (depending on your viewpoints on certain cultural issues.)for instance, in this short (68 minutes) 1931 film you have:the grandpa of the family that is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the united states (picture that in today's films!)a district attorney (walter huston) almost begging for death penalty sentences and the populace shown as supporting it 100 percent (once again, picture that in modern-day movies.) along the way you have some shocking violence, such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet, and his father being picked up and swung repeatedly head-first into a wall. this is a tough stuff, to say the least. yet the film is dotted with comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandpa, memorably played by charles "chic" sales. there are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film. and, for soft touches, there are the two young boys, one of whom - dickie moore - went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day. here, he is just a little tyke of about 5 years of age who, understandably, is far from being a polished actor, but you can see stardom for him on the horizon. in fact, he did just that the following year with a solid performance in "blonde venus," starring marlene dietrich.anyway, this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence, comedy and sentimentality....and it has a nice feel-good ending and a thought-provoking message. it was up for an academy award, too, for "best writing, original story." i am sorry to say it is only available for viewing on cable tv as it has never been put out on vhs or dvd.....and that's a shame.

way too many christian films become centered around the fear of the judgment, and as a result come across as condescending and indeliberately cheesy. "second glance" gets it right. this is a near perfect evangelical tool; it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with christianity. it assures viewers that one must give up their sin--not their fun--to succeed in the christian lifestyle. "second glance" even works as a piece of film-making. the filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget, but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers' attention from this obvious fact. this film brought me to my lord and savior, jesus christ, and thanks to christian stations everywhere which show it, it surely has impacted more people than just me.

dan burgess is a nice guy. he happens to be a christian. dan can't get a date with a girl and thinks that all of his friends are having all of the fun. he is constantly being bothered by non-believers and being made fun of.dan prays one night, and wishes he was never a believer in jesus.his prayer is answered for one day. things get hairy from there. an angel appears to dan and explains his prayer is granted.so, all of the impact that dan has had on starting a christian club.he be-friends scot parks and making a difference, is erased for one day.dan's eyes are opened. his life really did make a difference.

this film is about a teen who is struggling with his social status in school. he is a "good christian" and feels that he is missing out on all the fun in high school. so he wishes he had never become one. after getting his wish and trying a worldly lifestyle he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically diminished and wants to go back to being the person that he was. good family-oriented film with a positive message of being proud of who you are even if you're not the most popular.

this movie is apparently intended for a young, evangelical christian audience as a teaching tool. for that i give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. it's a decent movie to show a youth group, but i don't think it will be very well received beyond that. for any other audience, i'd rate it lots lower.the reviewers that saw "it's a wonderful life" in this were right on, though i didn't think of that until they mentioned it. i was more reminded of a "chick tract", those little 3" by 5" gospel comic books. if jack chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts, it would probably look a lot like "second glance." it has a strong christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by christian stereotypes. the christians are all very nice, somewhat passive, and squeaky clean, while all of the non-christians seem to be bad people.muriel the angel plays a major part, and he is the corniest, cheesiest character in the film. he is the most unlikeable angel i have ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. i don't know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly, or if he just struck me that way. (i admit that he reminded me of someone i know.) dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that i wish had been answered.but the movie does display positive christian values, and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson.

i am a college student and i bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description. nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest movie ever made!it is especially good to watch if you are an atheist, like me. because then you can see how silly these christian people are. they seem to think non-believers like to live in really disgusting, messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors. it's a laugh riot!my buddies and i watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our wildest imaginations! see this movie now!let's hope rich christiano makes some more of these movies to entertain us heathens!

lady and the tramp ii is very colourfully animated, and the songs, especially that of the junkyard dogs, are quite good. however, the family seems even too idyllic, and i can't help understanding that scamp is discontented when everything is forbidden. however, i also pity angel who never has had a loving family until she meets jim dear and darling.in any case, it's clear that the original lady and the tramp is better than this sequel.

lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure is a cool movie that many kids today can really relate to. it's a well-presented story about a kid who longs for the freedom to do things his way, and how he goes about getting this freedom is only a part of what makes this film interesting. just forget the itty-bitty disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a pup's point of view, because that's just 0.5% or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer. great music, lively acting, talented animation and directing, and a powerful storyline tell a tale of the difference between freedom on the streets of new england and a cozy home with your family. and that no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends are "always there" to help you though any tight spot.i can't wait to get the soundtrack!

after a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good movie.this movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made. it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye. he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye. doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attempt.the acting by the grandfather, the boy and the doctor are simply superb. they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life. every bit of action has some meaning in it. i would recommend to watch this movie, as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectations.this film is really going to touch your hearts.i would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this.

i am a maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and its obvious that i'm not much into even bollywood, let alone marathi movies. yet, when i watched shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling, one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of generating.it is a fact that, like most indian movies, the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language. a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its marathi dialogues, which, however hard one tries, can not be effectively translated into english.shwaas explores, in intricate detail, the relationship between a grandparent and a child. and it does complete justice to this strong bond. dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe"(my parsha is also one in a million) enhance the emotion. anyone who has closely observed the grandparent - child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the movie.overall, it definitely worth watching. its a movie that has left a profound effect on me. i will surely recommend it to anyone!

shwaas is awesome ! considering that the producers had a meagre budget, they have done an excellent job. it is a must watch. the small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes. grandfather is at his best. the photography is superb. technically correct and very creative. it helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content. the movie will keep u engrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days.i sincerely hope that they make it to the final oscar nominationenjoy and again don't miss it

caught this movie on dd while flipping channels...and thank heavens, that too when it just started.. having studied in pune, this film touched off many happy memories of the city...that apart, one wonders why more movies like this aren't made...every character is so well etched-the grandpa, the kid, the doc...except for the social worker who grates a tad, the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw...a deserving entry for the oscars, even if it wasn't nominated...definitely leaves a lump in the throat...who sez u need mush to tickle ur lacrimals ? and to think that this movie needed sachin tendulkar to propagate it. inspite of being in marathi, there was hardly a moment where i wasn't able to follow the movie...the subtitles were good.. a must watch for any fan of good cinema.

this is a film about a six year old child from a village in maharashtra (a state in india) and his grandfather who come to pune (a city in maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child's life. the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation.the movie is not a typical clich√© indian movie, so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. this ia a supremely crafted sensitive movie which resorts to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru. witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. the acting is superb, dialogs heart breaking. your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation. the handling of the subject has been excellent. the film was made under great hardship by the director, sandeep sawant who had to knock many doors to gather the rs. six million (approx. $130000) budget. even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values. also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the boy's life in the village. sawant definitely seems to prefer village life.the acting by all is excellent. amruta subhash as the social worker is competent adding the required humane touch to her role. sandeep kulkarni as the docter is great, showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor. ashwin chitale as the child is a natural. he doesn't seem to be acting. everything about him is natural and does not seem forced.but towering above all is arun nalawade as the grandfather. he is astounding in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. it is a performance to cherish forever.shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple, the the results can be really surprising. 10/10.

this is a very touching movie. this is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. a villager (arun nalawade) brings his grandson, parashuram, to the city to get his eyes treated. but comes to know that parashuram (aswin chitale) has some rare cancer of eyes and has to undergo an operation and will lose both his eyes. the movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. the movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. though the movie is in marathi, language is not a barrier at all.it proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual masala. excellent performances. this is india's entry for oscars 2004. hope it gets the nomination at least. would rate 10/10.

in 1965 producer kevin mclory -who owns a part of the bond cinematic rights- associate with eon productions (harry saltzman and albert broccoli) for making "thunderball", the fourth film of the 007 franchise. the star is sean connery, of course.in 1982 mclory wins a legal battle and can produce an "independent" bond film. "never say never again" (nsna) is one of the two "unofficial" 007 films made outside eon (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof "casino royale"). nsna is a remake of "thunderball" and stars the original bond, sean connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence.the film is released some months after "octopussy" with roger moore, the 13th episode of the eon series. at the time press calls it "war of the bonds"... both films are a big success in 1983, even if "octopussy" earns more money at the box office.nsna is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director irvin kershner who led "the empire strikes back", douglas slocombe -cinematographer of "raiders of the lost ark"-, and screenwriter lorenzo semple jr -who wrote "the three days of the condor"- among others...the cast is excellent with connery, a then relatively unknown kim basinger, barbara carrera, klaus maria brandauer, max von sydow, edward fox...although all that the film remains inferior to the original "thunderball". it lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real bond movie: there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence, there's not the "james bond theme", m and q are not played by the traditional actors... it's a copyright reason: eon only is allowed to use these elements. briefly, nsna lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere.on the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. brandauer is a very good villain and the women (basinger and carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. but the main highlight is sean connery! he's once again wonderful in the role, he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in "diamonds are forever", his last performance in the role of the british super-spy before nsna.

the year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival bond films. "octopussy", starring roger moore, was part of the official cubby broccoli bond franchise. "never say never again", made by a rival producer, is, apart from the awful "casino royale", the only bond movie which does not form part of that franchise. its big attraction was that it brought back the original bond, sean connery; its title reputedly derived from connery's remark after "diamonds are forever" that he would never again play the role. some have complained that connery was, at 53, too old for the role, but he was in fact three years younger than his successor moore, who not only made "octopussy" in the same year but went on to make one further bond film, "a view to a kill", two years later.the film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to ian fleming's work. it is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of "thunderball", as that was perhaps not the greatest of the connery bonds. (a remake of "dr no" or "goldfinger" might have worked better). the plot is much the same as that of the earlier film; the terrorist organisation spectre, acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named largo, have stolen two american nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money. it falls to bond, of course, to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles.the film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful bond girls of all, barbara carrera as the seductive but lethal fatima blush and kim basinger as largo's girlfriend domino who defects to bond's side after learning of her lover's evil plans. a number of the bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or female accomplice- there are similar developments, for example, in "goldfinger", "live and let die" and "the living daylights". in the official series, bond's ally is normally regarded as the female lead, but here carrera, playing the villainess, is billed above basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. basinger, of course, has gone on to become one of hollywood's biggest stars, whereas carrera is one of a number of bond girls who have somewhat faded from view.of the villains, max von sydow makes an effective blofeld, the head of spectre, but klaus maria brandauer seemed too bland and nonthreatening as largo, except perhaps during the "domination" game, a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as "space invaders" that were so popular in the early eighties. brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native german, in films such as "mephisto" and "oberst redl", but he does not comes across so expressively in english.one of the film's features is that it both follows the normal bond formula and, at times, departs from it. there is the standard world-in-peril plot, chase sequences, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title. there is, however, no extended pre-credits sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. for example, bond's boss m becomes a languid, supercilious aristocrat, his american colleague felix leiter is shown as black for the only time, and the scientist q is portrayed by alec mccowen as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristically upper-class christian name of algernon) a distinctly working-class accent. there is also an amusing cameo from rowan atkinson as a bumbling british diplomat. although connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role, this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable bonds. 7/10 a goof. rowan atkinson's character states that he is from the british embassy in nassau. as, however, the bahamas is a commonwealth country, britain would have a high commission in its capital, not an embassy.

well, first of all - i am a big fanatic of horror movies, but however - i am pretty sick of all those damn american horror movies. they are all about the same thing - blood and violence. it's not even creepy. well, it's nothin wrong with the blood and all that - doesn't even bother me - but that's not what makes a movie creepy! that's why i find this movie entertaining - it's fun to see a satire which is making fun of the koncept "main horror usa". american splatter/gore-movies, they are not suppose to be creepy, only funny. that's ok. but when they're suppose to be "creepy", it mostly gets pathetic. however, there are a few great american horror movies (poltergeist, psycho, birds), but in the end it's all the same thing. that's why this movie came as a relief. evil ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic! i can't wait untill master director anders jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie! untill than i have to watch evil ed again - and again - and again! but i don't care - it is such an outstanding movie!

(spoilers warning) i cannot say enough good things about this movie. it is a great horror comedy/spoof that does everything right for a change. the humor is great and ranges from funny to so-funny-you'll-cry funny. in one scene, ed goes edit-crazy and deletes a big scene. when his boss is looking at ed's edit, he yells out: "where in the fu%# is my beaver-rape scene?!?!" hysterical. there are also many other great, humorous & memorable quotes and moments throughout: ed yells out "don't you fu#$ing look at me!!!" while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. very funny stuff. the plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it's priceless: ed is a mild-mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror-film editing department, and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters, and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited. this movie has it all and is simply hilarious. the dvd only costs about $7, and is a great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut. i own a lot of dvd's, most of which cost a lot more money than this one, but not many are as great as this movie. my evil ed dvd is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it. evil ed oozes style and quality -- something that hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn. evil ed is a rare gem, and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie -- you did everything right, and i love evil ed! 10 out of 10!!!

i honestly didn't think at first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects, boy was i wrong! from the very beginning to the very end the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like "evil dead" and "gremlins". this movie could be compared to peter jackson's works of art, though this movie isn't as gory as "braindead", but i sure wait these guys'll make another splatter movie.

first off, to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the b-horror range. what this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via nordic flavor. at times reminding me of the humor of jackson's dead alive and others of a stuart gordon flick this little find should have most chuckling throughout. the f/x reach a few highs of truly spooky (the first time ed meets his nemesis) but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f/x team that decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other films...gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations. the gem of the film is the humor. the gore works most of the time but more for laughs. at its heart its a parody and a fun one at that.

oh my god. obviously, when you rent or buy this, you're not expecting to see a documentary on the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. you're expecting a visual feast of blood and gore and and maybe even a scare or two. well, for those who are as sick and twisted as myself, you won't find many scares, but you'll come very close to urinating all over yourself in laughter. the catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. the first time i showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago, but still we laugh our asses off and use the catch phrases. it's as addictive and funny as sam raimi's the evil dead ii: dead by dawn and peter jackson's dead alive/braindead. from the opening scene's absolutely ridiculous dialog, to the splatter and gore department's finest works, to the wondrous abilities of ed the film cutter, you will laugh and laugh again. as far as the visual feast of blood and gore, oh yeah, they've got it. and they're pretty damn good at it... "the neck-bone's connected to the head-bone..." this film also may have done the best nightmare/hallucination/totally effing nuts scene i have ever seen. and that one's not mean to be funny, but man is it well done (and creepy.) overall, to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time, if you ever see this movie get it!!!! it's on netflix, i know that for sure.

evil ed is a swedish film about a man named ed (of course)and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of b horror films known as "the loose limbs" series. ed becomes so mad that he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people that are close to him, such as his wife and daughter.i first saw this movie back in 1998 and was baffled by what i had seen. to this day, this movie i consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there. as the movie is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few creepy moments.this is a cool flick but don't expect anything marvelous. it's simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars

ed (coincidentally an editor) is hired to cut horror films down to be favorable in europe (where standards are much more rigorous). but he finds the films very mind-destroying and starts going a little bit mad. okay, "a little bit" might be an understatement.let me just say this first of all: best. opening. scene. ever. a man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade. his boss then says -- with a straight face -- "you're fired". the entire film does not keep up this level of intensity, but it certainly tries.take the shotgun scenes, the decapitation, the clips from "lost limbs" (which my friend jason wishes were a real film). the writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a beaver and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a bazooka. that is something you won't find in any other movie (at least, i'm pretty doubtful you will).this film's biggest flaw is the quality. the picture isn't as crisp as a 1997 film should be, and the sound could be touched up (though it's not bad). i thought i was watching a 1980s film. although, that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind -- the film also had the 1980s style of writing and directing in it: a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top. i do miss those days.i wish i had more to say, though at the moment i cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film. i do think you ought to see this. you've seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting the head... maybe you've passed it up a few times. maybe you thought it would be cheesy. pick it up. savor it.

the box at my video store is why i rented this one. it looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course i had to give it a try. i was pleasantly surprised when i actually watched it being an "evil dead" fan. the swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece. a criminal tries to break into the house evil ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says "groovy" as he looks at his weapon quite like bruce campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in evil dead 2. there is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie. they don't just spoof evil dead, as there is a gremlin style puppet monster that cusses at ed in his refrigerator. my personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says "i'm coming to get you barbra" which in case you did'nt know is barbra's brothers main line in "night of the living dead". this movie pretty much has it all good plot, cool characters, funny stuff (gremlin puppet),scary stuff (demon doctor), excellent effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. i only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before ed goes insane but its well worth the wait. so if you liked "evil dead 2" or any of the other movies i mentioned above you gotta rent and watch it with a freind, and when your done try "brain dead" because i hear it is similiar to this masterpiece. 

you know those films that are blatantly awful but you can't help but love them? well that's what evil ed is, possibly the best awful film in the world. the sound is rubbish, the dubbing is crap, the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap. however, i can't help but love this film dearly and i have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. sam campbell (or the guy who plays him) should be featured on the actor's studio series as he is that memorable. possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana. seriously, if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed. keep a light-hearted approach to watching this film and you'll soon rate it a ten afterwards.

it has past almost 25 years since i saw this movie. i would consider this film as an all time classic in a drama category. anthony queen gives one of the most wonderful performances ever. in a matter of minutes he takes you from laugh to tears. this movie represents a splendid picture of how humanity changed after the ii world war. how a great part of that generation and the forthcoming lost its innocence. it has taken me long time to find this film by its name "the 25th hour". this type of films are not a moneymakers but they are for sure a treasure for some. i am very surprise why this movie is not used for the media in a broaden way in order for more people to enjoy this picture.

i first saw this movie in papua new guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since, although i have never seen it since that first time.just how easily good people's lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me forever.the movie is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by anthony quinn is superb.this movie should be in all college studies about man's inhumanity to man.

the 25th hour was a movie i just chanced upon.tuning in late at night, this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire film.tony quin is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman,and by simple jealousy , goes on this incredible journey--terrific movie,and a hidden treasure.

h.o.t.s. is one of those sexy 70's drive in movies that features many of playboys famous playmates from the 70's like sexy tall blonde susan kiger,pamela jean bryant,lisa london,kc winkler and the late sexy angela ames.and would you believe a post partridge family danny bonaduce?its the snobby girls verses the good girls(the hots girls)led by susan kiger.there's a couple of comedy relief gangsters,a runaway bear,a trained seal,misplaced bras,etc;etc;think animal house meets hooters.h.o.t.s. is an enjoyable little comedy with t& a no complaints here.i actually think that susan kiger was one of playboys sexiest playmates from the 70's.she did do a few more movies including deathscreams.if you like fun drive in movies you will no doubt enjoy h.o.t.s. 7 out of 10

h.o.t.s. is not for those that want hardcore porn. instead, this film is a precursor to many 80s era cult-classic college/frat films like revenge of the nerds and porky's and a post-cursor to the world-renown animal house. a good time if you dig a lot of big-titted 70s/80s playboy type chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as whack-material...h.o.t.s. is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts doing battle against the popular and trendy pi girls. this one has pranks, an aunt jemima-ish house keeper, and even an over-heated robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if boobies are your "thing"...well...i like tits as much (or probably more...) as the next guy - but with all the sleazy sh!t that i've seen, i couldn't help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile. i knew it wouldn't happen, but i still wish that h.o.t.s. had a bit more sex and a bit less cheeze. not quite as notable as nerds, porky's, or animal house, but worth a look for fans of those types of films...7/10p.s... and i forgot - this one has consummate douche-rag danny bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his "reality show"...

of course, going into it, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid t&a flick, and it is. but it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments. given the era in which it was made, and the obvious exploitation aspect, it is still one of the better b comedies of the time.while watching this movie, you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in "revenge of the nerds", and numerous other films of the same genre. most of the acting is horrible, and way over the top, but that's exactly what i expect in a movie like this. what it lacks in the way of acting ability, it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit.the amazing thing about this movie, is that there was obviously some money that went into it. films like this made today just don't have the same style. if you can turn your brain off, and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick. i dare anyone to not find at least something in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.

i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly. i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager, and again in college. i thought it was funny. and there are boobs everywhere! it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made, from r-rated films like "porkys" to soft-core "au pair girls"; it's a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity. the thing that made hots great was that, like the previous two films, it's a hell of a lot of fun. hots is like a girl-power version of "animal house", with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam. on a side note, whoever designed the "hooters" girls outfits must certainly have seen this film.

i watched this film with my family over a long thanksgiving holiday weekend. i am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it, though i didn't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head shearing seems promised, but, alas, doesn't happen.on the other hand, i watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, sparkle, and just plain fun. i think that the film has a female tone. women are not exploited in it even though i am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation. i think the movie plays with tropes of the period.i keep thinking someone ought to remake it. and flesh out some of the implications in the original.

when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly overton a young (and op and coming star) actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away.. she is amazing on screen and i'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her....the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride... not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before.. but a good experience :) i would recommend this movie... if only to see kelly overton.. this stage actor takes the screen by storm.. i give this movie a vote of 7... 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie.and on a last note.. sorry about my bad english.. if this is gibberish for you :p plz ignore me...

i saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it.although there were several clues which i could realize after second time watching ,i was not able to awake the dow-dawn case. maybe this was my carelessness.the subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with personalization.'let me go out'the key sentence of the film.let me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be free.a discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brain.anybody who have seen the 'machinist' would realize the similarities with breaking dawn.a man that could not escape from his conscience (again a psychological and an abstract concept)meets it in an human body.and he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escape.also i want to mention about the performances of 'breking dawn's stuffs.in spite of having not many experiences, from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early. usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like "the others") but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end. looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton (eve), i'm afraid i was not. her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me, in contrast to the amazing performance (or characterization) by james haven (don wake) ... i hope we see more of him. what a great little film, highly recommended to all!

it was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989, as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960's - the acting, the characterisations, the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier time.the film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the a-bomb on hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: a young woman, yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but emotive and effective nonetheless, the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific. family members become unrecognisable to each other, others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shock.the title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which yasuko is caught. rumors of yasuko's being in hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospects and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing sicknesses. the film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the japanese, but on the social and psychological damage that was wrought.i found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. while the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family, the film's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time - wars have horrific consequences, and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary. it is said that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the 'coalition of the willing' have learned nothing. while atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly after-effects have. this film is compelling viewing.

i didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful). i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family. imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you. i was really wrenching to see yasuko being rejected as "tainted" by the bomb. the image that stays with me most is when yasuko stands before the mirror combing her hair, silently watching it come out in clumps.

black rain is a superb film, but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as $300 apiece. i have the dvd, and it's terrible. very tiny non-anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution-killing size. acceptable sound. this is a primitive dvd that absolutely *has* to be rereleased.btw, i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain. the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd! and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them all¬ósubtitles in the black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack. buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding!

this is a pretty faithful adaptation of masuji ibuse's novel, "black rain." like the book it is very moving and thought-provoking. the story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married. they are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness, after walking through hiroshima on the day of the bombing. well filmed, well acted, moving, tragic, horrifying and funny.

after the atomic bomb hits hiroshima, charred bodies lie all around, deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. this black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor. the story revolves around a young woman yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. she is trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying, and people are worried the same will happen to her. after finding a suitable mate (who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan, it will frighten you, and will perhaps make you cry. the acting is good, not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made.

shohei imamaura's black rain was released in 1989 just at the onset of the aids epidemic, a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of hiroshima radiation victims an added poignancy. the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout, and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one. based on a novel by masuji ibuse who gathered information from interviews and the diaries of real-life bomb victims, the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion. it is a horrifying vision but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. the film begins in hiroshima on august 6, 1945 as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities. suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard. almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history. survivors must somehow restart their lives, unaware of the bomb's devastating after effects. filmed in high-contrast black and white, the story centers around yasuko (yoshiko tanaka), a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives. in hiroshima, imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a young boy with skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him, an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of debris, a mother is in torment as she rocks the blackened body of her child.when the family returns to their rural home, yasuko's life is forever changed. she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle shigematsu shimuza (kazuo kitamura) and aunt shigeko shimuza (etsuko ichihara). pretending that there is only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb has affected yasuko. "she forgot how hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed. everyone forgot it. they forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival. i'm sick of it," says a friend katayama (akiji kobayashi). yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being contaminated.when her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband, the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her health, even though shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she wasn't directly exposed to the bomb. the only suitor she feels comfortable with is another damaged man, yuichi (keisuke ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. at the end, the beauty of life shows itself ever so fleetingly when yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life, the king carp jumping in the water, playfully as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy. sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war. "human beings learn nothing", says shigematsu. "they strangle themselves. unjust peace is better than a war of justice. why can't they see?" immamura's black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly.

it infuriates me no end that, now and forever, i will have to identify this movie (which i consider a masterpiece, and i don't use that word lightly) with the qualifier "not the michael douglas movie!" not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing- the radioactive fallout that rained upon the survivors of the first nuclear bombings. in imamura's film, this is no cheap metaphor; the whole movie is about the fallout, physical and emotional, from hiroshima and the war itself. as the deterioration of a couple and their grown niece becomes more grimly clear, the ironic imagery becomes more potent, from the old clock that is reset each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the heroine's door. (these, in turn, are carved by a shellshocked veteran who is compelled, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with a motor that approaches the town.) the bombing day itself is shown in piecemeal flashbacks that are coolly horrifying. yet "black rain" ("ntmdm!") can be watched, even repeatedly, because of imamura's compassion for his characters. i repeat: a masterpiece.

saw the film at the hollywood film festival in oct '04 . mark robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of kelly overton. i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and ...surprise, i'm right. more hollywood actors should follow her lead, give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this. for all the great things i can say about the film and the director (and there are many) i just can't stop talking to people about kelly overton's masterful performance. we'll be seeing a lot more of her work, no doubt. congratulations to mark and kelly on a daring film. get it out in the theaters so i can bring all the people i made want to see the film asap!

wow, stella shorts are great! lots of patrons from the state and stella, the tv show. i never knew that stella could have gotten any better then they were on the tv show stella or even comedy central presents: stella. i also never knew short comedies could be any good. my favorite ones were pizza, racking leaves, the woods and david arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin greg. i think over all that david was the funniest one. its funny when he doesn't make sense. i like the music in the shorts. thats something i pay attention to a lot. they always had good taste in music. i wish they still made shorts, either that or bring back there sitcom. i hope they continue making good and funny comedy.

when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought "god, this is horrible!" but i loved wet hot american summer. so i knew something didn't make sense. there was nothing left for me to do but search out for the stella shorts which i had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. when i found them not only were my dildo expectations met, but i found probably the greatest comedy scenes i've seen in years. the set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. not only did i laugh my ass off the first time i watched them but continued to laugh harder when i watched them over and over again. it's really a shame comedy central had the restrictions of cable television for the stella series. it would have faired much better on hbo or showtime. their brand of humor can't be restricted by censors or popular culture. given even if it was on hbo i'm sure the "masses" would have voted it canceled in a season or less, but still it would have been fantastic. needless to say i'm now in love with stella and all it's individual members. any stella fan should check out david wain's site with all his short films. they are equally as enjoyable as stella itself. so my hat goes off to michael showalter, michael ian black, and david wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with stella. i hope to see much more of the troupe in the future.

hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy kids in the hall. be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. sex toys included!there should be more comedy like this around today. this collection of sketches on one dvd will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. if you enjoyed the state and/or wet hot american summer, get ready for some more glory. if you are even considering this for younger audiences i would say that every child on earth should see this.

if you were ever a fan of mtv"s "the state," then these three guys will be familiar to you. but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did, you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy.born out of their stand up comedy trio, 'stella', michael ian black, michael showalter and david wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows, and now after being available only to download from two websites, they appear in pristine glory on one dvd.think comedy sketch show sans censorship, and you'd be halfway there. no stone of decency is left unturned. but for those who like their comedy rude, self-indulgent and bordering on puerile, (and i mean that in the most flattering way) this is the dvd for you!i think it's worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone, you can't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions, cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse.fantastic.it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie bowen and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly. and you should follow their fine example, throw preconceptions to the wind, and prepare to laugh yourself sick.

i honestly don't know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review, as a result, i'm having a hard time describing these shorts. let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. and i loved every minute of it.not that it's all crude humor. it isn't. they stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled "pizza" in which they use one very well. "they" being 3/11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state, namely david wain, michael showalter, and michael ian black.the trio go on adventures, usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people, people that are often actually more normal than they are. the supporting cast is fantastic as well. paul rudd, julie bowen, bradley cooper, zach galifianakis, and sam rockwell all make appearances in various sketches. they're also joined by other the state alums like joe lo truglio and todd holoubek. the musical selections are also very well placed.i've enjoyed these sketches over and over again, but they aren't for everybody as they're pretty vulgar most of the time. if you like clever humor that isn't afraid to push the limits of good taste, then i highly recommend this. if you liked wet hot american summer (directed and written by wain and showalter) or the state, then you should really enjoy this.i think it can currently only be ordered online. check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first, and then find out how to buy the dvd.

at first sight the bothersome man seems like several other movies/books rolled into one. kafka's the trial, melville's bartleby, the fall and rise of reginald perrin and groundhog day instantly spring to mind. a man, andreas, arrives in a nameless city where he is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. however, there's a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, bland and utterly characterless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation -interior design. welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow, or spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing.andreas quickly realises his predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape, in various ways. suicide turns out not to be an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one - there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is, 'i don't mind'.in fact, much of what the bothersome man has to say has been said before, and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu. yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating, over and over again: an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. added to which, it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls. more than one character reminded me of people i've known, especially his furniture-obsessed girlfriend, and if by the end of the film the film-makers have run out of ideas, maybe that's the point - there will no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation.

mississippi mermaid is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the "wrong" person.truffaut's directing is his usual outstanding work. although this is far from his best. deneuve is very, very beautiful. despite the character she portrays.

this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. the kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. a title like this makes a film flop, even the french title is not much better. too bad - truffaut & deneuve must have been enough to sell it..this is a long film, but largely worth it. clearly influenced by hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love. the plot here is actually very good, and takes us on an unexpected trip.the thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship. it is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in "real life relationship" with these two people. unfortunately, this is what bogs the film down, and makes it ultimately dissatisfying. we do like films to have a real sense of finality, and that is missing here.it was the case in many of her films that deneuve became a canvas for directors to play their fantasies out on, and this time it doesn't work as well. messy here, is the fact that the director clearly just wanted to have deneuve take her top off a few times. deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful, so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat. basically, the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began, to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap. but truffaut didn't snap, did he? so - it wanders a bit, but remains interesting.

even the maria montez/jon hall technicolored baubles of the '40s are eclipsed by "princess of the nile," fox's entry in hollywood's mid-'50s obsession with things egyptian (see "land of the pharoahs," "valley of the kings," etc.) pure, unadulterated, mindless hokum, lavishly produced (low-budgeted, actually, but using sets and costumes left over from "the robe," this technicolored spectacle looks like it cost millions). 71 minutes of eye-candy (the plot, having something to do with nefarious derrings-do in ancient egypt, is beside the point) offers the cinematographer and audiences the delectable sight of debra paget wearing an assortment of see-thru veils, most of which hit the ground when she shakes and shimmies thru a slave-girl production number unparalleled in film history. female moviegoers were not shortchanged: fox's handsomest young contract player, jeffrey hunter, is as photogenic as ms. paget, while michael rennie lurks around in the background, stirring up evil doings in the land of the pyramids. for those who might think paget & hunter can't act and were only hired for their physical attributes, check out their subtle, overlooked, heartbreaking work together a few years later in "white feather" (another fox production that has sadly vanished into the realm of "lost films"). "princess of the nile" still stands in a class by itself as a cheerfully mindless, breathlessly fast-paced, dazzling testament to the glories of 3-strip technicolor--and the seductive charms of ms. paget (all of 20 at the time). put this one-of-a-kind kitsch classic at the top of your "guilty pleasures" list, and enjoy. satisfaction guaranteed!

a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "waltz into darkness" of the writer cornell woolrich. it is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. a wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat still young michel bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent. frankly bouquet was not so impressive in this film, but less than that was the performance of catherine deneuve. she was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover/wife of louis mah√© (belmondo). for those who like to visit the world, the film offers the occasion to see part of the ascension island, and also lyon city in france.

with looks that could kill, and a willingness to display her charms, paget's sensuality leaves no doubt as to where her assets lay... she plays a sultry-innocent 13th-century princess who rouses her people to save egypt from the ambitions of a powerful beduin (michael rennie) and joins her forces with the son of the caliph of baghdad (jeffrey hunter) to save her trembling throne... she also finds time to fulfill a great deal of exotic dancing... her luscious legs make her hard to forget!the emphasis is not on the plot, but on the visual pleasure of a great number of beautiful girls in sensual technicolored costumes...

why jessie matthews, one of britains top musical stars, was in this movie in between her sparkling "the good companions" and the classic "evergreen" is a good question? when i first saw it i was really disappointed. i wanted to see her sing and dance - she was billed as "millie - the non - stop variety girl" but there was more stop than variety.now i see it as a good little drama.it is about a bus crash and the stories, leading up to it, of the people on the bus.apart from jessie matthews, who is great as millie - sir ralph richardson plays her fianc√©e ( yes, that's right).edmund gwenn - who went to hollywood to co-star in lassie movies and also with natalie wood in "miracle on 34th street", plays a grumpy businessman. gordon harker is his very annoying partner.emlyn williams - who wrote "night must fall" was the black - mailing villain and frank lawton, who went to hollywood and appeared in "david copperfield" and "the devil doll" is the young man in trouble. sonnie hale who was married to jessie matthews at the time played the bus conductor.

this agreeable french movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an african island nearly to madagascar named louis(jean paul belmondo). he's a single man looking wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named julia(catherine deneuve). when she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. he marries to julia but she suddenly disappears.a french eye private(michael bouquet) is hired by julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. later louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name. in spite of the romantic delusion and everything, louis goes on enamored with his enigmatic wife.this film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayal,deception, killing, theft and hitchcockian suspense. good performances by jean paul belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful catherine deneuve as suspect heroine. the film gets several references to the american cinema, but truffaut(400 blows) was a fervent moviegoer, such as : johnny guitar, colorado jim, bogart, and hitchcock.the usa version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering. loosely based on the novel titled'waltz into darkness' by cornell woolrich (rear window and screenwriter of alfred hitchcock hour) who also was adapted in 'truffaut's the bride wore black'.colorful cinematography by denys clerval(stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by antoine duhamel, truffaut's usual musician.this is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¬®farenheit 451 and shoot the piano player¬®. remade by an inferior version by michael christofer(2001) with antonio banderas, angelina jolie and jack thompson, full of erotic and lust scenes.

for pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the subspecies films. i highly recommend each and every one of them.

king vladislav (angus scrimm) of romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind. but his son, radu (anders hove), is a cruel creature to his very heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him). three female students have come to study local folklore, but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time: vladislav has been killed.who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from angus scrimm? i can't. i mean, i had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures ("puppet master" in particular, and "demonic toys"). but despite the really bad animated effects of the demons, this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch. plenty of blood, a good plot and backstory (the bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles on the vampire mythos, which you'd think would be dead by now. (maybe i'm wrong, but this is probably the first film to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun.) aside from vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (gratuitous, but welcome) and i had to notice the excellent score from the composers (not sure who deserves credit, but those involved include stuart brotman, richard kosinski, william levine, michael portis and john zeretzka). this is horror 101 all the way. heck, you even get two sequels, which is the sign of a true horror film. (of course, some bad films get sequels, too -- did i mention "puppet master"?) the romanian theme was well-done, and the film even seems to have been made by romanians if i am guessing their name origins correctly. and the score -- the music -- really stood out for me as a nice change of pace, very mood-setting. i like richard band, but i'm glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head. if you like vampire films and want a slight variation (one of the eastern european variety), this is worth seeing.

the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever. there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite. the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by angus scrimm (the tall man from the phantasm movies). and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane. (thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough). well radu`s brother stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although radu does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle gellar :).rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).

first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a top film, then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i find there is sub 1v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on, and also there is a fifth in the pipe line. if no one has seen the movies. these are the best of the best. i think it deserver's a thousands oscar's. i could watch these from morning to night.i would love to have a set of nails like he has, watch out girls. i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film. these ant typical vampire movies they are better. i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films. it would make all my dreams come true

i was ten years old when i saw subspecies, i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate, they really do have some great on-screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this: ion and rosa, the servants, have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king. what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene: michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. however, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera. another scene in the script, that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin.this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters; even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders hove's radu is pure feeling-evocative acting, so much feeling in his work there.

i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind. full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night. for all the cheesiness of most vampire films, this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels. a must see.

i watched this on sky tv late one night, as i am a vampire fan. i must admit i half expected it to be a b-movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong.subspecies is about a family of vampires. when a vampire lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and noble stefan, and his brother, the evil, hideous radu start a war with each other over their birth right, the bloodstone. the bloodstone is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints, which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high.the fight for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers' territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts.like, i said, i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen. the sets and locations (romania i think, been a while since i've seen it) are very nice and the music score did the film justice.most of the acting was adequate, but its anders hove as the evil radu that steals the movie (and all the subsequent sequels). hove's performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay, to pretty d@mn good!

"subspecies," like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on imdb. the majority of movie-watchers have a hearty contempt for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror films, they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes. unfortunately, "subspecies" is not particularly laughable, and not that bloody, so it gets a low rating. that's too bad.of course, there's plenty to criticize here. the non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a poor special effect, and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit. but what do you expect? for a straight-to-video horror film, "subspecies" boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate. the film's romanian setting is virtually unique (i believe it was the first american movie made in that country, post-communism), and the locations, both interior and exterior, are beautiful. the script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (all bogus, i'm sure). somehow, the location filming and smartish script work well together - "subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. to risk damning with faint praise...it could be a lot dumber.fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood-drooling vampire villain, radu. he's pretty effective in this movie - powerful, with a memorable raspy voice - but i like him better in the sequels, when actor anders hove gives a more self-parodying, campy performance. a totally sincere radu is somewhat silly. other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves, who are clearly only in the movie because producer charles band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also puppetmaster and demonic toys).but i linger too much on the movie's flaws. for what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "subspecies" is perfectly fine. the sequels boast better production values, more violence, and somewhat more thoughtful story lines, so i recommend them even more highly. still, this isn't a bad start for the series.

this is a perfect example of a classic full moon pictures movie. any fan of horror/vampire flicks should definitely check this one out. original plot and good, easy to follow story. also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine horror with action. as of now, the only sequel i have seen to this movie is part iv, which i have to say is almost better than this original.i give it 10 / 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, slumber party massacre, skinned alive, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

the film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the actors, deneuve and belmondo. though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. i will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist. i would recommend this film to all truffaut or deneuve fans. it is a brilliant hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. the film is approx 2 hrs, so you feel that you have not been sold short. deneuve steals the show in this film, and it is clear that at the time of making the film truffaut was very much smitten with her. a definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. 10/10

(contains spoilers)people who put a lonely heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. they try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. the exchange of letters is full of hope...louis mahe (jean paul belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la reunion (east of madagascar) is so affected by the letters of julie roussell that he proposes to her. but not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the "mississippi", but - catherine deneuve. and we know from the start that she is a marriage imposter and that a crime has taken place. she shows no interest in "julie's" wardrobe (she does not even get her trunk open) and neglects her canary until it dies. but the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are sufficient to transform louis into a pliable little dog. first: a joint bank account. and then, when julie's sister draws attention to herself, the flight. with 27,850 millions of louis' 28 millions - she would have needed his signature for the entire sum.louis and julie's sister engage a private detective (michel bouquet). louis contrives to trace marion (deneuve's real name) in antibes where she works as taxi-girl - her gangster-lover left her penniless, or rather centimeless. louis finds himself unable to kill her. she tells her story: orphan. precocious. lesbian experiences. many sugardaddies. jail - and soon she leads him by the nose again. the detective turns out to be sly as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound; louis and marion bury his body in the cellar. they flee to paris, where louis discovers that marion has a costly taste. she worships money like a deity. he sells his firm at a fraction of its value. but when the corpse of the detective is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again - without the money. life in a mountain lodge, together with a whining loser - marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage...a high point in the careers of everybody involved. belmondo's self-deceit makes him nearly endearing. deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by yves st. laurent, and her performance is delightful: at first she fakes the fragile wifey - too timid to ask her husband for money, that's why the joint bank account is needed - but after being exposed she sounds like katharine hepburn in the jail scene of bringing up baby. the scenery is spectacular - the tropics, the riviera, paris. truffaut directs with self-evident aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions. after this film truffaut was able to look his idol, alfred hichcock, full in the face.

in reunion island in the indian ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory louis mah√© (jean-paul belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with julie roussel and he does not know her. when julie arrives in the island to get married with louis, he waits for her in the docks but louis does not recognize julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to louis. they get married and louis shares his bank accounts with her. when julie's sister writes a letter to louis asking her sister to write to her, louis discovers that the woman is not julie that is missing. further, he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island. louis and julie's sister hire an efficient private detective comolli (michel bouquet) and louis travels to france seeking the woman, but he has a nervous breakdown in nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic. he recovers and finds that the woman, actually marion vergano (catherine deneuve), works in the phoenix club priv√© in antibes and lives in the low-budget monorail hotel. louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club, she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover richard had blackmailed her. louis is still in love with marion and escapes with her to the countryside. but comolli is chasing marion in france accused of murdering julie."la sir√®ne du mississipi" is a film-noir by the great director/writer fran√ßois truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. the femme fatale catherine deneuve is astonishing, probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. jean-paul belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive. catherine deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of louis. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "a sereia do mississipi" ("the mississippi mermaid")

i've slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut. both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of them.next to "the soft skin", coincidentally staring deneuve's sister (the late francoise dorleac), this would have to be my favourite truffaut film.as well as directing, truffaut also wrote the screenplay. something that always strikes me about truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.there's a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot. he rings the doorbell and deneuve answers wearing a negligee. in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street, deneuve changes into her dress, puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes, then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. it's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that's truffaut for you.watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure. she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. incidentally, for those fans, there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.i disagree with previous posters. i see nothing 'hitchcockian' about the film at all. as for the 'look' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's. it certainly gives films of this period a unique look.highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans......

this is one of the best films i've seen in the last years.belmonndo and deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir. forget that feeble remake with jolie and banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.

i love this movie. it is the first film master p have ever done. it is based on the story of his life. it is low-budget, but it is very good. it shows how master p grew up in projects in new orleans.not only did master p start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with moon jones. the dvd also has the no limit ice cream party on it. this movie shows how master p goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him. it also has many of the no limit records roster in this film. you should buy or rent this film.it is a great movie to watch is you like rap, or is a master p fan. i will not spoil this movie for you. go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it. you will like it.

alfred hitchcock's "saboteur" (1942) (not to be confused with another hitchcock film, "sabotage" made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the master of suspense greatest film. it dose not have the depth of "vertigo" (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of "rebbeca" (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in "notorious" (1946), but what it dose have is thrills, adventure and a nail biting climax. the two leads, admittedly, are quite weak. it is easy to understand why hitchcock wanted gary cooper for the robert cummings role and barbara stanwyck for the role that was taken by priscilla lane. also, the patriotic speeches that cuumming says (that were written by dorothy parker) have dated badly, and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). however, the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing, the climax atop the stature of liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "north by northwest" (1959). the two villains, otto kruger and norman lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the aircraft factory is a superb sequence. this not the best film hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining.

this movie was marketed extremely well. when it was released in '97, during the middle of master p's fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves. that's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250,000 copies and still goin'.if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out. it has a few old school phatty videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party. so what i got to say to all the people who don't like master p or no limit records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter tru no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes.

a man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire, and must travel cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand. a plot line that was later used to fuel hitchcock's classic north by northwest, saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the master himself.for any hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades. here, the likable and charming robert cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, not withstanding a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone.in terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. however, there is some nice chemistry between cummings and his lead lady, the much under-appreciated priscilla lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by vaughn glaser. the best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what hitchcock would use later in north by northwest, only this time the climax is atop a statue in new york. certainly not his best, but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.

this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full, the first was rope, which i really enjoyed. with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas rope took place all in one room. i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. as a thriller, i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states. the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. the sound design is almost non existent. you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.the film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.the performances are there, but nothing amazing. everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. the one stand out is otto kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.in the end, i wanted more from this one. i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films, but i did have a good time watching it. i can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.

bob cummings is excellent in this, as this technically brilliant hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today. priscilla lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other blonde's that worked with hitchcock later. she just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today.there are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director. the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today. every person in the cast performs well. there are several great backdrops in the black & white film.this was the first film at universal for hitchcock. long run between the feature films he did at universal, plus the television series, hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there. this fact gets lost in film history.norman lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film. the story moves along really well including hitchcock's only filmed western sequence. this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it.

i am a massive hitchcock fan, ever since seeing "rear window" on television. "saboteur" is not hitchcock's best for me though, it is very good but not a masterpiece. it does have its faults, some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete. but hitchcock's direction is superb, and the performances weren't that bad. while robert cummings and priscilla lane both do a good enough job, otto kruger and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show. the story is good, about a wronged man on the run, very similar themes used in "39 steps" and "north by northwest", and cleverly provides some much needed escapism. the music score was absolutely outstanding; the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and i liked the digs at tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto and beethoven's 5th symphony. the cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. namely the statue of liberty climax, but the circus troupe encounter and the radio music city hall shoot-out is also on the money. overall, not hitchcock's best, but definitely worth the look. 8/10 bethany cox

overall, this is entertaining and odd film. don't try to make sense of it. there are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with, but robert cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this "fugitive"-like story.unlike the popular tv show and then 1993 movie, this fugitive isn't looking for a one-armed man, but a two-armed nazi saboteur by the the name of "frank fry." cummings ("barry kane") gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in los angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it (fry) to clear his name.the first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. then priscilla lane ("pat martin") enters the story, and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. director alfred hitchcock often did that with his female characters, to the point i wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. lane's character here was a little lame.actually, the villains played by otto kruger ("charles tobin") and norman lloyd ("frank fry") were the best, in my opinion......just fascinating. kruger's acting and dialog was especially good.if you haven't seen this film but saw hitchcock's well-known "north by northwest," you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. instead of a climactic scene at mount rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the state of liberty. as usual, hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view.

i really loved seeing this movie. i think it's a brilliant, underrated alfred hitchcock movie. everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene, but there's a really great movie before that. robert cummings is great in what i consider to be his greatest role, and the beautiful priscilla lane shows that she has a lot of talent too. but i think norman lloyd gives the best performance. his character, fry, is so evil and devious. even though he's not in it for very long, the movie wouldn't be the same without him."saboteur" is a great movie that every hitchcock fan should see. i give it a 10 out of 10!!

this movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and timely patriotic sense of pride in america. the nazi saboteurs of the 40's are replaced by the middle east terrorists of today. the intent is the same, to terrorize, disrupt lives, destroy property, and kill americans! we see a wrongly accused barry (bob cummings) on the lamm, trying to uncover the real nazi terrorists plot, meeting the beautiful pat (priscilla lane) and together, they travel to new york chasing the devious and evil saboteur fry, played expertly by norman lloyd. along the way, they encounter the also very sinister otto kruger playing the leader of the nazi saboteur ring but disguised as a distinguished model citizen, where barry seeking saboteur fry, takes him into his confidence, only to handed over to the local law enforcement. he escapes, meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece, enter priscilla lane. from there, barry and pat travel to soda city cal., run into the west coast saboteur gang heading east. they trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely new york socialite. the going gets tough when the bad guys kidnap pat from barry and he goes after her with reckless abandon. the movie climax is the famous statue of liberty scene which is excerpted in many compilations. this is a true, blue patriotic flag-waving performance at it's best and what is wrong with that! see this movie if you don't see another hitchcock film. you will be swept up in the patriotic furore and the love interest between cummings and lane will make you wish they had been paired in other movies. she is the beautiful, ideal girl next door, often underrated, her talent shows through in this film. see it and go bless america!

hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business, who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved. that way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. we certainly do in this fine film. barry kane is only trying to help his fellow-man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration, like helping fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory. barry even returns a lost $100 bill to fry later on...that was big money in 1943!! it's barry's acts of christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself. similar to the 39 steps in plot, the hero travels cross-country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells, an arch-villain who nobody could believe to be a closet-nazi, and a beautiful blonde, patricia martin, who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with barry kane. hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys, all the way from las vegas to nyc. we meet a trucker who's a one-man comedy act "someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day." field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the "suits" just as if they were working for some legit enterprise. during a chase scene into a cinema, audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy/gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie-patron. awful for the dead old man, but funny! hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance, with the statue of liberty as backdrop and ironic icon! it works even better than the mt rushmore scene in nbnw.

i consider saboteur as hitchcock's first "american" film, because the story takes place completely in u.s.there are brilliant scenes in this film. statue of liberty scene, barry kane jumping into the water from the bridge, water fall scene are amazing. its not hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted. hitchcock originally wanted gary cooper for the leading roles in foreign correspondent and saboteur. but gary cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. another reason why hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors. although rebecca was a huge success, still most of film's success went to producer david o. selznick. for example, david o. selznick got best picture oscar for rebecca. and hitchcock didn't get a best director oscar for rebecca. hitchcock started getting some attention after foreign correspondent (1940). but universal gave him a low-budget for saboteur (1942). hitchcock tried to get joel mccrea for this film, because he was willing to work with hitchcock again with a low salary. he enjoyed working with hitchcock in foreign correspondent (1940). but he was unavailable. so the role went to robert cummings. hitchcock called robert cummings "a competent performer." i thought he did his best. he was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role.as for leading female role, hitchcock wanted margaret sullavan or barbara stanwyck for the leading role. they weren't interested either. so universal decided to give the role to priscilla lane. i read in a book that this was one of her favorite films.i also liked the scene at blind man's house. that is my favorite scene. if we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in uncle philip's house, then we will see how intense it is. uncle philip (blind man) was studying barry kane's character the moment he entered his house. the moment barry entered his house, he heard barry's handcuffs. through conversation, he realized that barry kane isn't a criminal at all. we also see his hearing ability through those scenes. for example, barry hears the sound of a car says "is that a car coming?" uncle philip says "2 cars i think." uncle philip was right. we see 2 cars in the next scene. priscilla lane did a fine job playing her role. she was no big star. but i thought her performance was really good. another brilliant scene in uncle philip's house is the scene where he asks priscilla lane (patricia martin) "are you frightened, pat? is that what makes you so cruel?" i thought otto krueger played the villain brilliantly. hitchcock wanted harry carey for the villain. but he refused. harry carey is famous for his role mr. president in "mr. smith goes to washington." i want to mention more about this film. but i think my post is getting too long.every hitchcock film is special in its own way. i am sure hitchcock fans will like this film. i rate 10 out of 10.

i thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career. possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. after watching, one remembers murray alper as the jovial truck driver, vaughan glaser's touching turn as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to harrison ford's similar stunt in andrew davis' "the fugitive") and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believable.the other major support player is, of course, hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. my feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement.obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the second world war, but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.

jewel thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is. suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief. the story portrays that dev anand (vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces. but you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain. there are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious ever lasting songs sung by lata mangeshkar, asha bhosle, kishore kumar and mohmmad rafi.this film was also talked about for its song's videos. consider the teasing and counter teasing in asman ke neeche. or the blocking of road by dev anand when tanuja was going out with her friends in yeh dil na hota bechara. or the romantic dil pukare are are in the beautiful sikkim. or the wonderful dance by vyjantimala in hotho pe aisi baat. add to it rulake gaya sapna mera and raat akeli hain and you will never forget this film for any reason.able acting by dev anand, ashok kumar, tanuja and vyjantimala and direction by vijay anand (dev anand's younger brother) makes this one of the best loved hindi films of all times even today.

there are many familiar hitchcock elements (of previous and later films) and this time they mix to a jolly, but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment. you can tell that dorothy parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. the famous climax on the statue of liberty seems a bit heavy-handed - judged by today¬¥s standards, but also compared to other hitch monument finals (e.g. blackmail, north by northwest).

cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam, looking for the real culprit. the familiar hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of "the thirty nine steps" and "north by northwest," although it is not as good as either of those classics. there are some impressive set pieces, including the finale on the statue of liberty. the plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a terrific start, it seems to run out of steam. cummings is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead. lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's later films. the supporting roles are generally well played.

ah, hitchcock! it's hard to find a bad hitchcock movie until he lost it after the birds (1963) and saboteur proves the point. having admired most of this director's work for many years, i had managed to skip this one, perhaps from lack of interest in priscilla lane and robert cummings as lead actors. i was of course familiar with the statue of liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but i wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest. was i wrong! the suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the bad guy saboteur and the good guy wrongly accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes. familiar hitchcockian elements are all there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people not being what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspenseful scene being played out within them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion, an upper floor of a skyscraper, and finally the torch of the statue of liberty).throughout is humor provided by supporting players, generous dollops of early ww2- vintage social comment, moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human, getting nothing in return ¬ñ in short, there was always a basic humanity at the core of hitchcock, however grisly the trappings - a sensational cast of supporting players, chiefly otto kruger as the slickest villain this side of george sanders (his broadway credits include the male lead in noel coward's private lives ¬ñ and that says it all) and weaselly norman lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention alma kruger ¬ñ no relation to otto ¬ñ as a prominent society dowager involved in fifth column intrigue (her character foreshadows that of claude rains's mother in notorious). priscilla lane does a fine job with a difficult role. for most of her early scenes we can't tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion, not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings. one cannot ascertain whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of uncertainty, but the plot developments are so swift, fun and clever that we really don't care what she thinks.then there are the peculiar hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. twice the lane character pauses to get change for a quarter ¬ñ once to reimburse her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a phone booth. why these scenes were inserted are anybody's guess, perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus heighten the believability and suspense? or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath? some of the characters are over the top ¬ñ the garrulous truck driver, the impossibly kind and trusting blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest cabin, the political-philosophy-spouting "human skeleton" and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers.

screenwriters peter viertel, joan harrison, and (of all people) dorothy parker enable director alfred hitchcock to expound on what may have been his favorite movie theme: innocent man, wrongly fingered for crime, takes it on the lam. hitchcock, who some credit with originating the story, engineers a great deal of suspense in plot about a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion which killed his best friend; he sets out on journey to find the real culprit. plenty of excitement on a grand-scale, with usually-colorless actors (priscilla lane, norman lloyd, alan baxter) doing surprisingly fine work. even eternally-smug robert cummings gets into the proper spirit! *** from ****

an entertaining first draft for "north by northwest", "saboteur" has some wonderful hitchcockian moments (one of the best occurs at a table, when the hero is asked by a woman who hasn't yet seen that he's wearing handcuffs, to give her a plate; trying to do that, he also drops a knife to the floor, exposing himself even more!) but suffers from a poorly chosen lead (whether he's delivering patriotic speeches, romancing priscilla lane, making jokes or trying to look worried, robert cummings is wooden), and from a lack of really distinct villains (oh, there are villains, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time). (***)

i really enjoy this film. it is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or delared war on us,i.e., the japanese and germans. robert cummings and pricilla lane were excellent in the lead roles. the supporting cast... otto kruger, alan baxter, clem bevins, and norman lloyd were also outstanding. the direction, pace, and finale held and continue to hold my interest. so much so, that i bought my own copy. thank goodness for turner classic movies, they show so many of the truly classic films, including this one.robert cummings was certainly no light weight as an actor and although i am a great fan of gary cooper and joel mccrea, two of my favorite actors, who were first offered the lead role, i don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed bob cummings' performance.this is a film that i enjoy watching repeatingly and urge others to view.

barry kane (robert cummings) is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war. he goes on the run, meets patricia martin (priscilla lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice.there are a lot of things wrong with this film. robert cummings was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role; priscilla lane is pretty but was never a good actress; the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and rambles on longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a bit much (but this was made while wwii was in full swing) and there's no ending. it shouldn't work but it does.it's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest.for example: lane says to cummings (while they're falling in love), "i wish i could have met you a hundred years ago" (????!!!!); lane pays a villain for getting her lunch and cummings and lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run. also hitchcock's direction was (as always) just great--he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences--especially the statue of liberty climax. this is not one of hitchcock's classic movie but is still very good and worth catching.

you can't help but marvel at hitchcock's early work. "saboteur," for example, is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. there's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. you also get some previews of stuff that hitchcock would do later--like using a national landmark as a backdrop. this time it's the statue of liberty. in "north by northwest," of course, it's mt. rushmore. you'll also recognize things that pop up later in "rear window" and "vertigo" in "saboteur" but let's not give away the show. robert cummings is excellent as is the oh-so-charming otto kruger. look for hitchcock's mini-western in this one. it happens quickly so don't blink.

alfred hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his best-regarded films; made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures, suspicion and shadow of a doubt, it's generally regarded as a lesser effort. i agree that the later film is groundbreaking, drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time, but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion; its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players, bob cummings and priscilla lane.in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america, literally, as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused. cummings is very youthful here, and quite engaging. his boyishness (but not immaturity) perfectly suits the character he is portraying, and seems appropriate, as the director, though middle-aged, was in the process of reinventing himself, and an older, more established star might have thrown things off. priscilla lane's spunky heroine, which not a typical type for the director, was very much a common type in american films at the time; and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time. i cannot imagine older, more solid types,--cooper and stanwyck for instance--doing any better, as they would have, between them, carried, well, too much baggage.as is the norm in hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears. where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early. though cummings is an accused arsonist, we know that he is innocent. the villains become apparent fairly soon; and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies. what pleasures there are are incidental, and here the master does not disappoint. there is an interesting, tod browningish interlude with some circus freaks, who help cummings elude capture. in another scene, reminiscent of james whale's bride of frankenstein, cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man, who, as it turns out, is lane's uncle. was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade? whatever the case, these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety, which, when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads, makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man, still learning his craft.the film's later scenes, in new york, are more suspenseful and typical of the director, as the picture gradually becomes more hitchockian as it moves along. in the end i find it a satisfying work; and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor, neither does the movie have one. it is deliberately lightweight, and i suspect semi-experimental; an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off, in an american setting, the sort of story he had done so well in england. he succeeded admirably. the next logical step: shadow of a doubt, a film in which the main character travels east to west, and with a wholly different set of values and plans. 

an excellent thriller of all time. vijay anand excels as director and editor. performances by dev anand, vyjayantimala, tanuja and ashok kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. cinematography adds to the mystery, glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. and to top it all, music by sachin dev burman is unforgettable. "yeh dil na hota bechara" by kishore kumar, "raat akeli hai" by asha bhosle, "rula ke gaya sapna mera" by lata, "aasman ke niche" by lata and rafi and "hothon pe aisi baat main" by lata, again reaffirm burman dada's unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own.

jewel thief is *the* crime thriller of bollywood, and why should it not be? it is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in indian cinema vijay anand ('johny mera naam' and 'teesri manzil.) i could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):1 vijay anand's direction 2 r d burman's music 3 dev anand 4 vyjayanthimala 5 ashok kumar 6 majrooh sultanpuri's lyricseven if jewel thief is not a bond movie it definitely has bond babes. helen, tanuja, and the mysterious vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) but our sauv√© vinay (dev anand) is anything but bond. he is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are. he even flirts with anju (tanuja) trying to hit her romantic nerve, just so that he can get employed in her father's shop.dev anand might be in a double role - well i don't want to spoil your movie or else i would have told you. that is what most of the mystery is about. dev anand works in a jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - though is not, or at least has a perfect alibi. we wonder who did it, is it dev anand as 'vijay' the person he claims to be or is it 'amar' someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike. comes 'shalu' (vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is her fianc√©, in a tense situation dev anand has to prove that he is vinay and not amar. while everyone wonders if dev anand is vinay or amar he is asked to remove his socks. amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot. while we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold dev anand even finds time to joke. the real life brothers director vijay anand and actor dev anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in crime thriller. there are moments of hitchcock's north by northwest, but the movies are very different. except for the confusion about who is who, a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isn't a lot of similarity. dev anand could very well be amar in addition to being vijay. people have seen him, they identify him where ever he goes. there are too many of those people for this to be a fraud. finally vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being amar to find out what is the truth, and it is a sad mistake. he gets too deep into it, only to be saved by the twists of cinema.when i watched the movie as a kid i was definitely not amused, the ending confused me completely. even now there are parts about the ending that i do not like, but i'd recommend this movie anyway.even as a kid i enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'yeh dil ...' - a definite loafers song in kishor kumar's voice. i could hear 'rulake gaya ...' whole day long. ditto for 'aasmaan ke neeche' which is set 'under the skies' of gangtok (at least the story line suggests that). 'raat akeli hai' among the sexiest song to come out of hindi cinema featuring tanuja as the seductress. 'meri taraf dekho' - helen's cabaret and we 'look at her'. 'hothon pe ...' - now, could there be any better thriller of a song than this. as the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words 'hidden in shalu's lips' add to it.

unlike bond and other detective movies, alfred hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. jewel thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is vijay anand's tribute to the master of suspense. the tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes vijay anand as a great director himself.it is the story of a common man vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called amar who in fact is a jewel thief. suddenly vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this amar who remains one step ahead of him. the suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. just like hitchcock's movies, jewel thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of sikkim.everyone and i mean everyone; dev anand, vijay anand, ashok kumar, vajyanti mala, tanuja, sd burman, kishore kumar, majrooh sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms. this is one of the best thrillers ever made in india.

jewel thief is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation. a young man vinay, superbly played by a newly face lifted dev anand at age 40+, is estranged from his police officer dad and finds a job in a jeweler's store. soon random people come up to him and call him amar. using just a few pithy moments the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. then a woman shalini (vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. she is accompanied by her loving brother (ashok kumar) who is so convinced that vinay is actually amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not aamr, the 6 toed one. the jeweler's super cute daughter anju (tanuja) is completely enamored with vinay. amidst all this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will. slowly we learn from vinay's encounter with a super hot night club singer (helen!) that the thief is amar the doppelganger. many many good looking women (anju mahendru, faryal) are after the hero. the police force, including vinay's dad, are completely befuddled. vinay is slowly falling for shalini/shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. the action moves to sikkim as that is where amar's next heist is to occur. the rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hang on to vinay's every word thinking he is their boss amar, the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by vijay anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. the movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in sikkim.i was not a big vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here, although at her chubbiest. she is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing. tanuja is cute as a button and i loved her in this film. i so badly wanted her to get the man. dev was, well, dev. if he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) i would wonder who they had found to imitate him! yet his style, charm and charisma were unfailing. in the song yeh dil na hota bechara, only dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! ashok kumar was simply awesome - dada moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books.sd burman spun magic with numbers like baithe hain kya uske paas (helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top), aasman ke neeche, rula ke gaya sapna mera, and my personal favorite seductive number raat akeli hai bujh gaye diye.if you are craving a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to be kept guessing, yet amused and entertained - then go buy or rent jewel thief. better to buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your buddies. this one is a keeper.

nice movie. at the begining, i thought it's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie, but the ending totally surprised me. i guess, the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of them can be the main subject,e.g. avenge, friendship, and dream. but it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. i think, it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining.

duck_of_death needs to watch this film again, as his major criticism is completely baseless. the film never once forgot about the time delay, and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places. the crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn't obey the time delay rules.one thing i did think was a bit far-fetched was the amount of risk involved - would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours? i doubt it. would a manned space ship go into a star's corona? i doubt it. would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? i doubt it. also, the ship seemed overly sturdy. would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down? i doubt it. would it survive being hit by comet debris? i doubt it. i think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much. but all-in-all, the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects, good editing and production, and some good acting, especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the russian cosmonaut.

i came across this movie on dvd purely by chance through a blockbuster rental. voyage to the planets is an excellent bbc 2hour documentary/drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. taking pains to adhere to current knowledge about the planets and space flight, and plausible extropolations from existing technology, this movie tells the story of astronauts on a journey to venus, mars, jupiter, saturn, and pluto.the special effects are excellent for a tv show. i found the actors believable as astronauts. the situations presented are for the most part plausible, and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and spaceflight! only two minor complaints: i found some of the situations and dialogue somewhat maudlin at times. furthermore i am unsure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once time. more than likely, visits to venus, mars, jupiter, etc. would/will be separate missions.they didn't try to skimp on this show with production values. the scenes of venus and mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of chile--the driest area on earth and a dead-ringer for the martian landscape. weightlessness sequences were filmed in a diving russian transport jet. the producers could have fudged on either of these using studios and cgi, but chose the real thing instead.i would like to especially mention the marvelous music that was composed for this movie. don davis's thrilling theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts, as the magnificent shot of the pegasus passes the screen and david suchet intones "it is the destiny of man to explore the stars...".watching this on a small television screen is one regret i have. what a thrill to see this in a movie theatre, or even better an imax presentation!

i was part of the cast of space odyssey, playing fido in mission control. i just want to say that none of us actors, specially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen most of the time, had any idea how amazing it would turn out to be. i knew it was going to be good, if only for the sheer camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at impossible pictures provided for everyone involved. but when we all saw it for the first time at the screening at the curzon mayfair, well, i for one felt very proud. i was so glad that none of us looked like we were in star trek. joe aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most amazing man to work for. he pretty much gets a good team together and then just trusts them implicitly to freely do what they do best. i'm really lucky to have been part of this show. who knew something this epic and complicated to understand would turn out to be so enticing to watch. and my god it's a beautiful universe out there.

obviously, the the responses here were written many years after the film was released and cannot be taken in context. back in 1980 in post labour england, this film was bloody funny. we were glad of something to laugh about and rising damp, with its sympathetic mockery of a complete social strata, was one of the best british sitcoms of its period, if not ever. it struck a chord in almost everybody and in true british fashion, we laughed at the rigsby in ourselves. america had nothing to touch this type of humour because self debasement was not amusing to our overseas cousins. leonard rossiter was one of englands finest actors, on stage, on tv and in movies. his commitment and professionalism were second to none. richard beckinsale was, although young, a perfect comedic foil to rossiter and should, by all rights, be classed as an all time great. had he not been taken so young, i feel sure he would, by now, be classified as one of britains greatest comedy actors. frances de la tour found her finest television moment in rising damp and, for me, never quantified her undoubted ability with further roles. if you did not see the film at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment, simply because you cannot understand why it was funny, the humour of the moment.

the history of tv to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place. there are, however, some examples which manage to pull it off, just. rising damp would, at first, appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit. also the writer, eric chappell, wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of tv episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film. this, in itself, didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail. david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly. although, the early dad's army episodes, with their staid pace and over arcing plot, lent themselves far better to film adaptation. the rising damp episodes, however, were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax. as a result, as one story is concluded and another started, the scenes within the film become disjointed. another pitfall for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made. in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising damp's brilliant series. despite all this, rising damp the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious. it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film. this includes a rugby match where rossiter does a brilliantly timed pratfall. indeed, while all the cast handle their roles perfectly (bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale), it is leonard rossiter as rigsby that shines the most. in fact rising damp should have been made as a film just so rossiter could have been eligible for an oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent. criminally, he wasn't even nominated. ultimately, the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments. recommended viewing.one last thing: the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history.

so, americans make t.v. series based on movies, whilst us brits make films based on t.v. shows.it should never work, but on this occasion it does because of a sublime meeting of character and actor. cliches are sometimes justly so, and leonard rossiter was born to play rigsby.this is one of the great comic creations, kind of how norman bates would have turned out if he'd been melancholic instead if murderous.

the best horror/sci-fi movie i have ever seen. i was myself in the arctic, working for canadian government , in a small northern station when i see this movie for the first time; needless to say i was in the mood...

although i saw this movie in korea, in korean, and therefore did not understand the language, images sure say more than enough. from what i can make of it, this is the story: two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. one of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. the other has to hunt him down. this movie is visually great. the swordfighting is great. and the movie has a gripping end. i just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers. and be released on dvd, of course.

i must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. it wasn't as epic as musa-the warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days. his counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end. you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right. and me personally...i loved the end. i could watch it over and over again. maybe a little pathetic, but a real freedom fighter story.... people can be killed, but not the ideas they stand for....

after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, i thought it looked very entertaining. before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received. i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. despite the hype, i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable. the story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. i haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time. i really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond. as reading previous posts about this movie not being "epic" enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more. this film is what it is, its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action.while sword in the moon isn't perfect (what movie is?) it still is wonderful and moving. just wait until the ending scene, with the music and cinematography together, its breathtaking. i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting.

this was very funny, even if it fell apart a little at the end. does not go overboard with homage after to hitchcock - owen (danny devito) was lucky he had "strangers on a train" playing at the local cinema, so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration. devito is very funny but also a little sad. he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. his teacher, billy crystal, is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success, which also has him frustrated a great deal.best parts are the book proposal by mr. pinsky ("one hundred girls i'd like to pork") and all scenes with anne ramsey, who is so horrible that even mother theresa would have wanted to kill her, too!

"throw momma from the train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs.billy crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; danny devito plays a man in one of crystal's writing classes. crystal's ex-wife is a *hag* to put it nicely, and crystal hates her. devito, sensing this, offers crystal a deal one night: devito will kill crystal's wife, if crystal kills devito's nag of a mother. crystal does, of course, refuse, but later, corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes. and so as things play out we see what happens when you try to throw someone's momma from a moving train.this story is an interesting character study; a story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what's right, but most of all corruption. we see crystal's white-collar writer become ever-stressed with events colliding around him, and because of devito's constant nagging, he says "yes." but we know deep down in his subconscious he wanted to say "yes," and he's pleased that he said it to devito.this movie is a bit of a dark spoof on hitchcock's immortal film "strangers on a train," and it plays an homage to the film early on, when there is a theater playing "strangers on a train." we see devito watching the movie, and a lightbulb in his head pops on. he gets an idea. throw momma from the train!billy crystal gives another convincing and strangely comical performance as a hassled writer on the verge of collapse. he has been so beaten down by everything around him that his inner-emotions come out and he agrees to throw devito's momma from the train. danny devito directed this film excellently. he uses just the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and sickness. everything is demented, but not to an extreme like in some other dark comedies. it has just the right touch of darkness that shone through in "the war of the roses."not only is "throw momma from the train" a simple tale of corruption and morality, but is also an interesting character study. definitely worth catching on tv.3.5/5 stars -john ulmer

i saw the movie on its north american premiere (july 14, 2004) at the fantasia festival. i was slightly disappointed as i had been expecting a more epic, ensemble cast movie along the lines of musa the warrior. instead, the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. there were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequences. it almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts "flick" or a historical epic. the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations. is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change? is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones? how does one decide? these questions are raised in this movie, and ironically, there is the suggestion that the answer given, may in fact be the wrong one!

i don't understand this movies distinctly average rating!?i really really enjoyed it, i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t.vthere are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. danny devito played a gem, quite a feat considering he was directing as well. his down trodden laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way. there are people like that, owen was just on the line without crossing it.billy crystal's comic syle and sense of timing was perfect for his role. his frustration/comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more... you could understand his feelings. to really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view, to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here thrice over.thirdly, who else could have played momma? there is no one that can play this part so well. there is a style there unlike any other, something you love to watch, i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because momma's character was, again, so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch.and what's more? a happy ending with new found friendships, no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life... without a big hunk of cheese tied on the end.brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great film.

this movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it. we knew it was there- every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. it almost became a joke... "i know, let's watch throw momma from the train"... i don't know why it was always turned down, it just was. little did we know what we were missing out on. it still befalls me why it took us so long...i mean it stars danny devito, billy crystal, and ann ramsy (who we referred to as "the lady from the goonies"), an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household. but there it sat for nearly ten years. until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer....it was like finding king tut's tomb...no movie has ever made me laugh so hard, and i doubt any movie ever will. i had to rewind for almost every line because i was still laughing at the line that came before it, and lost ability to hear or pay attention. not just simple laughing, either... the kind of laughing that expends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. the kind of laughing that you cannot control, that causes rolling around and spasms, and tears and snot running down your face because it's just that freakin funny. once i learned the movie by heart i will say this effect has lessened, but i don't think i will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate. i think that's all i can say. i would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it please don't let me know, i will probably be offended.

i thought that the interplay between crystal and devito was great. the movie is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. ramsey as "momma" is vulgar and over the top, but also very funny and effective. the character has to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother? now crystal's wife -- she is a "slut" whom everyone would like to receive her comeuppance, thus her role, though minor, is also effective, because it has to justify crystal's ridiculous case of "writer's block." while there are certainly dark moments, the movie is not depressing and, despite the murderous urges that the protagonists feel, they have redeeming qualities too.overall, this is one of the funniest movies i can remember, one that i don't mind watching over several times.

in a really neat spin on hitchcock, larry (billy crystal) and owen (danny devito) lead unpleasant lives: larry's ex-wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote, and owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable. when larry tells owen to calm down by watching "strangers on a train", owen gets the idea that they should do criss-cross murders like in the movie. and just like in the movie, larry thinks that it's a joke, but owen's serious.how they came up with the idea for "throw momma from the train" i'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. there isn't a dull moment in it. and that ending was a hoot. crystal and devito are at their best, and anne ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in "the goonies". a modern classic.

you don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. this directorial debut from golden globe nominated (for actor) danny devito, also playing owen/ned 'little ned' lift, is a terrific hitchcock-like film about one man's hate for his wife's book (she stole his), and one man's hate for his mother. basically, owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher larry donner (billy crystal), and he inspired by murder stories. larry suggests he see a hitchcock film, quite ironic, and that is when owen has the idea to kill larry's ex-wife, margaret (star trek voyager's kate mulgrew). owen is inspired by 'strangers on a train', swapping murders, so larry must kill owen's horrible momma (oscar and golden globe nominated anne ramsey). larry was convinced owen killed margaret, and also that he had to/wanted to kill owen's momma, but there is a happy ending when months later both larry and owen bring out books, momma died naturally, and they went on a holiday with beth ryan (kim greist). also starring rob reiner as joel and oprah winfrey. with hilarious moments, a great director/actor and his support, this is a must-see comedy. very, very good!

this movie is extremely funny - the character of momma keeps me returning to the movie time and time again! i can't get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he smells up the place ... and her suspicion that owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts! it's hilarious!if you like movies such as national lampoon's vacation, uncle buck, or planes, trains & automobiles, this has similar humor. it's a great, wholesome laugh ... a must see!

just thinking about the movie, i laugh to myself. anne ramsey plays an unforgettable part as 'momma,' probably the most nasty, yet hilarious matriarch ever captured on film. danny devito and billy crystal make a fabulous duo, bringing a true warmth to the film. though not exceedingly complex, the cute story holds your attention, and keeps you laughing the whole way through. it's a fun comedy to lighten things up, and even will entertain the kids. i give it my full recommendation.

the one thing i really can't seem to forget about this movie, is its beginning: classic comedy, brilliantly crafted. i love it. see it for yourself (no spoilers here! :-). the sparring between devito and crystal also glows in this movie, with devito as the perfect oppressed son. one of my favourites. highly recommended for fans of crystal.

this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen. danny de vito plays owen perfectly. momma is excellently portrayed, and was one of the highlights of the movie.at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect. larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles. larry teaches a writing class and owen tagged after larry trying to get him to read his story. owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother, and in return owen would kill larry's ex-wife. the whole movie was really hilarious.one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes "throw momma from the train". larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot. it turns out that owen wrote a children's pop-up book.i would really recommend this movie. i gave it a 10.

now, throw momma from the train was not a great comedy, but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh. the title may seem a little strange, but the entire movie isn't literally about that, although it is about something just as sinister.danny de vito basically wants to kill his overbearing mother, and fast forward a little bit, some random and funny events take place. the premise is quite funny, and the things that billy crystal and danny de vito get into were great. some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me, but this didn't make it a bad movie.for what it is, a wacky comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it.

well, sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea, and despite the mostly negative responses i've heard to it, and the suspiciously tardy dvd release, i couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :d perhaps low expectations were an advantage, because i was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.an assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit. this doesn't take particularly long, but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. through prolonged flashbacks we learn why, and the history of the swordsman and the assassin, and of the revolution.the film is typically melodramatic for a korean film, and resolutely serious in tone - no hk style comedy moments to be found here. the story can be a little difficult to follow at first, but all makes sense eventually. the film goes a bit wobbly at the end, but no worse than a chang cheh film might do, and for the most part i found it enjoyable. the production values are high, with some good cinematography to capture it. the fight scenes aren't up to the calibre of the better hk wu xia films, but perhaps they're not meant to be - the fights are more "realistic", in that they're less like choreographed dance routines, but there's some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in "wu xia" mode. the film doesn't have the best cast, unfortunately, with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other. there's a young lady in the film that i don't think i've seen before, but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast - not just because you see her nekkid... or perhaps it is :p the film lacks the charm and grace of the better hk wu xia films, and perhaps the beauty too, but i only wish hk would make them half this good anymore - twins effect 2 does not give me hope that *that's* about to happen any time soon, though tsui hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast. sword in the moon is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means, but it's a whole heap better than romantic warriors or legend of the evil lake - perhaps better than bichunmoo too, though i did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing. obviously it's nowhere near the wonderful musa, but it's a different affair altogether really. sitm will probably get a second viewing within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much i liked it :) 7/10

i am surprised people, after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's, i thought more people would get a kick out of "throw momma from the train". this was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors, billy crystal and danny devito. together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. when billy gives some "misunderstood" advice to danny, danny offers a proposition to billy, if he kills his ex wife, billy has to kill his mother. this is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! it's a good one!7/10

a picture starring danny devito and billy crystal. they are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy entails them trying to murder each other's pet peeve. billy crystal's pet peeve being his ex wife who stole his book and put her name on it, and danny devito's pet peeve being his malignant mother. billy crystal is an author and a teacher apparently and danny devito is one of his students. this comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages.danny devito seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time. she says things like "you have no friends!" and when billy crystal fell down, she said "burry him before he stinks up the basement!". she puts down danny also by calling him "lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.

this movie is basically a spoof on hitchcock's strangers on a train, which i thought was overrated anyway. the plot has danny devito going to see strangers and then thinking billy crystal wants them to swap murders, for crystal to murder his mother and devito to murder his wife. both devito and crystal are great and so is devito's mother. this is devito's directorial debut and it's better than the war of the roses.

stars: danny devito, billy crystal, anne ramsey, kim griest, kate mulgrew, oprah winfrey and rob reiner.after college class, teacher larry (crystal) wants his ex-wife dead and owen (devito) wants his momma (ramsey) dead. when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead, owen knows what he must do for him, in order for a favor in return, for larry to kill his mother. devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head. he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer. ramesy was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs. lift. along with having comedy, the film also has heart. one scene between devito and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke, but goes deeper, actually making me slightly sad. danny devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction. for any fan of comedies i recommend this.my rating: b plus. 84 mins. pg-13 for language, sexuality and violence.

spawned by the same monty berman / dennis spooner partnership which produced the champions and randall & hopkirk (deceased) - the latter retitled my partner the ghost for the us market - department s remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s. like those two shows, its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (dept s also has a black superior), but it's mostly facade: the launch episode, "six days", is barely halfway through before rosemary nichols is called upon to parade around in bra, panties and one (yes, one) stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation. still, it's an interesting time capsule, even if the appalling fashion sense of peter wyngarde's character (which, amazingly, degenerated even further in the spin-off series jason king) should definitely have remained buried.

with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters, department s will be forever associated with peter wyngarde's jason king.most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character: he's far more nuanced than that.jason king is lazy (he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end), he is egotistical (his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not), a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right...and she often is. he's clearly a man having a mid-life crisis and drink drives but.......jason king is brilliant. if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero, it wouldn't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love of finery and prone to grandstanding (and it gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history. and by not playing him as whiter-than-white, the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it.watching it again on dvd recently, you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king.

created by dennis spooner, 'department s' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol, based in geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. if a plane landed at heathrow with no-one aboard, if a man was found wandering around london in a space-suit, if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton, if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters, you called on 'department s' to sort things out.peter wyngarde played 'jason king', a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases. king caught the public's fancy and was later awarded a spin-off show. he was ably assisted by american 'stuart sullivan' ( joel fabiani ) and the delectable 'annabelle hurst' ( rosemary nicols ). unusually for a '60's show, the department was headed by a black man - 'sir curtis seretse' ( dennis alaba peters ) if the show looked and felt a lot like 'the avengers', it was hardly surprising. it shared many of the same writers and directors! the colourful titles were designed by chambers & partners, and are worth tuning in for alone. as was the case with so many i.t.c. series, the music was composed by edwin astley. his theme for 'department s' has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time.predictably, the show looks a little sexist and dated now, but don't let that dissuade you from tuning in. imagine a hybrid of 'jonathan creek' and the 'austin powers' movies and you've got 'department s'!trivia note: the episode 'a small war of nerves' features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role!

like night stalker and then x-files, the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out. unlike these, the hero(es) weren't left holding an empty bag at the end. they had usually tangible results. it was also made clear that the 'good guys' were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things. imagination, wit, acting which didn't always take itself too seriously ... i miss it. one reason being, i'm hard pressed to think of too many shows - banacek aside - which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat. the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable, if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to. explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet, for all that, still made sense. too, i agree with another reviewer that the anabelle character was somewhat underused, but when she was on screen, it wasn't just for eye candy. she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it. a rarity in those days. sullivan? if he wasn't in the department, he'd be working for the kgb or cia. he's that sort of coldly efficient, ruthless type. he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done. king? it's clearly a game to him. one he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective/spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real' job. he's probably the most fun to watch of the three, although they all have their moments and often, too. i do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original, however.

the incomparable laura gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french "emmanuelle 2." this amazing woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon cast as the lead in this all new italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. in this first installment, mae jordan/emanuelle is sent to africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. much like sylvia kristels character, emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. this first film is basically about how she becomes the "emanuelle" that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with. filled with gorgeous cinematography, beautiful people, and an intoxicating 70's score from the legendary nico fidenco, this one is sure to please. those who enjoy the more story-driven style of the original french "emmanuelle" should definitely like this as well. the main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him! sexy, fun and totally entertaining throughout; a soap opera to be sure, but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained. for some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on dvd. there has never been a legitimate dvd for this, which is very strange. the bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release.

you know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. i'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring french professionalism and the heavenly campy joe d'amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. laura gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. it's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. you can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. often. every reason is good. every person is good. every location is good. one scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in africa. sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough laura gemser for all.

wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently. actually, wales seems to be developing its own little film industry. i recently saw very annie mary, which i thought was very good. but plots with a view is not only quirky, it's laugh out loud funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (brenda blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not entirely original, is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines. it was the kind of movie that i wanted to watch again immediately it was over, and one of very few that i would actually like to own. even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have been to a welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the rapport between blethyn and molina is a joy to behold.

i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it is hilariously funny from start to finish. the plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. when i went to see this movie i hadn't heard much about it and i didn't know what to expect. i thought it was going to be an old ladies' type of film like calendar girls or something but it took me completely by surprise. even though i am still a teenager and the film was probably not directed at my age group, i still found it excellent and i think that people of all age groups would like it. i think it is a shame that it is not at all famous and it deserves more publicity so that more people will go and see it and realize what a great movie it is.

i accidentally bumped into this film on cinemax while channel surfing. i must admit that what attracted me was christopher walken. and the setting was the kind i would like, so i started to watch it. at first i expected a serious drama film, and it seemed like so for a while... until i started to giggle here and there, and before i know it i was laughing so hard all through the film. i really like how subtle and light-hearted it is, but still has a huge impact on the audience. the plot is very simple, and it's far from trying too hard to be funny like many hollywood "comedies" are, yet it almost had me rolling on the floor. a must see for a nice evening rest, or any time in that case.

a humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business. it's easy watching, and even offers blethyn & molina stealing a scene from an old fred & ginger movie. walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of molina in the undertaking business, trying to bring a new style to an old welsh town. we see a couple of very funny examples of the "new style". the plot thickens with pugh having an affair with watts, and her suggesting that they do blethyn in. meanwhile molina has rekindled his long suffering romantic feeling for blethyn, and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the south seas, and dance away their days together. during the "fake" funeral blethyn learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge. watch it for a view of what funerals probably should be--a celebration of life!

two funeral directors in a welsh village? english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic? how could i resist. my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs. we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening.the mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait. it raises issues rarely talked about in the community, but i know three funeral directors, and the humour is right on the moneyhighly recommended and congratulations to the writers. without you all the actors, directors and the others havn't a job on any monday.

hilarious from start to finish, there's got to be great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile, specially when two funeral parlors are battling for control of the market: a classic parlor and a revolutionary one where every funeral is a show, lead by christopher walken, a treat in the role of the visionary american mortitian. but the rest of the cast is great also, and this one is another success that only uk is capable of making. surprising among the ensemble cast is naomi watts, that strikes in another metamorphosis (accent included). always sporting a smile on its face, it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called "four funerals and one wedding", but you'll understand when you see it.

i saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the u.s. nonetheless, it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies. it concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small british town. the plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable.the acting is great across the board. sure to be overlooked in the crunch of blockbusters, this is a movie worth looking out for. i know i will try to catch this in the theaters again and/or buy the video.

this movie is one of the funniest i have seen in years. a movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing, or irreverant. christopher walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and i could hardly breathe for laughing so hard.i saw the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but cheered. i am telling all my friends to watch for it's arrival in the usa. i definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on dvd as soon as it's available.

once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor, not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house. too bad.brenda blethyn (who i first saw in saving grace early in the year, another must see by the way.) just excels, as alfred molina does. the rest of the cast, while virtually unknown to me, turns on great performances too. the film starts slowly and gradually gains in pace and amusement - midway i had tears in my eyes from laughing.all in all, a funny english movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny' garbage that comes from hollywood.

very lovely love story between brenda blethyn and alfred molina. the whole story is very bizarre and funny. an undertaker (a. molina) loves a married woman (b.blethyn). they try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village. a scenario of strange situations starts. as good as saving grace and long live ned devine.

i found this a very enjoyable light hearted comedy set in wales with some truly funny sequences highlighting the rivalry between two funeral directors. the showbiz ideas used by christopher walken's character to liven up his funerals are genuinely laugh out loud moments.

this was the film that started that the cinematic love affairbetween the jaundiced eye crew and matthew ferguson. hisability to portray relatively normal characters like birkoff in"la femme nikita" is counter-balanced by his equally defthandling of weirdos like "kane." one wishes that he would onlybe given more roles, bigger roles, and other, even more complexroles to assay to push the limits of his abilities. there werefour or five memorable scenes in this film, and matthew fergusonstole two of them from far more experienced actors. this filmitself is good, and it is worth watching on its own merits, butferguson makes it a little extra special. his *ouevre* mayeventually show what the career of anthony perkins might havebeen like if he hadn't been typecast as "norman bates" so longago. "kane" isn't quite as whacked-out as norman, and far fewerpeople saw "love and human remains than saw "psycho," so we canhope that ferguson will show us some hint of what perkins mighthave been able to accomplish, had he been allowed to do so. . . .

watched this flick on saturday afternoon cable. man, did it drag. i got the metaphors, symbolism, and all that stuff. no, i didn't care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. but, the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep.that is..... until ruth marshall got naked. if you're a breast-man who is not homo-phobic, you may want to rent it. ruth has a lesbian sex scene that's pretty hot, and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare. her jiggly d-cups made the film worth the watch.--the mighty avatar

there is, as many reviews have observed, a strong dark streak to this movie. the director it most recalls to me is john landis (yeah, go ahead and howl about what a peasant i am). arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak, gray kind of way, then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch.the cast is, without exception, above average. thomas gibson, as david, is outstanding as the moody and self-deceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve. he talks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. it was difficult to look at him and see greg montgomery, let alone agent hotchner of criminal minds.perhaps not the best scene, but the one i enjoy most, my "rewind scene," is the section where candy is expecting a visitor, and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door. as candy's interpersonal environment swings further and further out of control, david just grows bouncier, perkier, and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt gen-x "tigger."

i first watched this movie in istanbul film festival back in 1994. it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week. the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing. it sure is a very powerful gay movie. some scenes make you feel you're watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines. i guess i'll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight...

i bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99p an it's been sitting in my video bookcase for at least a year now. then tonight i decided to see it, the film was quite different to what i had expected and i didn't find any humour in it all i saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and i didn't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film. i felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. i was following her emotions and what happened around her. some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but i could really put myself in her place, loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try. i thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well. i was expecting something like bound & gagged : a love story, but this is a very different film. not for bigots.

extremely good cinematic story of gay, embittered former teen star, now waiting tables. the sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically, and with an actual human face. this, and throw in a serial killer on the loose, and you have love and the human remains. a well portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. the screenplay is fluid and believable. the performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are sharp.this certainly isn't everyone's ideal notion of a movie, but for those who appreciate something different and slickly written, it's very much worthy of your time. highly recommended.

once again, i am amazed that thomas gibson did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career. in this film, gibson once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th century. tender yet not effeminate, afraid of the basic tenets of love, gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. also worthy of praise is cameron bancroft's performance. his need to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friend's "homosexual conquests" provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected. bancroft and gibson's chemistry is apparent from the first scene they appear in together. there are many "panels" in this quilt. from gay relationships to straight relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer at its core. my only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before i discovered this movie! i look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend it to any fan of bancroft, gibson or director denys arcand.

yes, this film has many gay characters. it also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence. this is not a film about sexual orientation. it's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another. filmically, denys arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships. the serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed). thomas gibson centers and grounds the film; it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him. the supporting cast is strong, especially mia kirshner as gibson's friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness. the film's involving and often surprises in its character development. the effect is somewhat like robert altman directing a david mamet script---the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning. often, in our search for love and a conventional "relationship", we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. arcand and the writer, brad fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.this film is a rewarding experience. it may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. loneliness is a universal experience. a film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.

i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie, but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie. the character of gust,played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman, was one of the most unique, yet entertaining characters in recent memory. this movie informed,yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive, and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie. it takes no time to understand what is going on, and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine, human emotion. i thought i knew my history, apparently i didn't know it at all! i give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it for all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, just not the young. but as soon as they are allowed to see "r" rated movies, make it a priority.

charlie wilson (tom hanks) is a hard-partying, womanizing texas congressman with no discernible legislative record. in 1980, he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the ussr. on the auspices of his old flame, arch-conservative texas socialite joanne herring (julia roberts), he travels to afghanistan to assess the situation, and is stunned by what he sees. he returns to the us determined to help the afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use. undeterred, wilson recruits herring and the vulgar, outcast cia agent gust avrakotos (phillip seymour hoffman) to begin a convoluted arms deal involving israel, egypt, pakistan, saudi arabia, and a mostly unknowing us congress. ultimately, the afghans defeat the soviets, but while america celebrates their victory, wilson and avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war afghanistan falling on deaf ears.charlie wilson's war is slick brain candy, a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average film-goer. the movie assembles an astonishing array of talent, both in front of and behind the camera, and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time. the film's has only one flaw, which we'll arrive at later. as an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th century's largest covert war was waged - and, perhaps, the way that things get done by the cia and other intelligence agencies - it's fascinating.the movie is interesting on a number of levels. the story portrayed in the movie - with all of its outrageous double-dealings, sneaky covert operations, and, perhaps most of all, its success - would be so outrageous as a work of fiction, that it could easily be dismissed as a satire. but things really did work out this way, at least within reasonable bounds. the film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws. wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices (even embracing them) - yet willing to embrace a righteous cause. herring is something of an elitist, and her born-again attitude of righteousness is off-putting - yet she's deeply committed to the cause of the afghan people. avrakotos is a cia outsider with an attitude problem, looked down upon because of his "street" background - yet his love of country and hatred of communism are unwavering. the fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the ussr is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that truth is stranger than fiction. it's also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy - not too surprising, given that our writer is aaron sorkin, but it's an interesting way to approach this story.the movie does, however, have one drawback, which is a bit surprising. the film seems to unabashedly celebrate wilson and co.'s achievement. this is fine - nothing wrong with defeating the soviet union, is there? - until one considers that out of the ashes of the soviet defeat in afghanistan came the taliban and eventually al-qaeda. regardless of the us's level of responsibility, it happened, and the movie's portrayal of wilson's success is almost unmitigated. to be fair, the movie does address this issue towards the end, with a rather topical speech by wilson about the us's inability to clean up after themselves, but it's done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it. the overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the afghans defeat the soviets. this isn't a fatal drawback, mind you, but it's one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. the film's talent is remarkable. the legendary mike nichols delivers a slick, gorgeous-looking production; the material is perfectly suited to his understated, wry directorial style. sorkin delivers yet another brilliant screenplay; the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic sorkin exchanges (the best being the "scotch bottle" discussion between wilson and avrakotos), and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it. the film's cast is a marvel: tom hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause, julia roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed joanne, and phillip seymour hoffman steals every scene (par usual) as the abrasive gus. the always-lovely amy adams takes another step on her road to stardom as wilson's long suffering assistant, and ned beatty, om puri, emily blunt, christopher denham, and ken stott flesh out the supporting cast.charlie wilson's war is an intelligent and fun movie, a wonderful bit of a-bit-more-than-light entertainment. the fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldn't be held against it; it's brilliant at what it does.8/10

recap: based on the true story of charlie wilson, an american congressman, who (according to this movie) was instrumental in usa's covert war in afghanistan against the soviet union.comments: a rather funny movie about not so funny things, especially since they were real. but focusing on the movie, hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan. hanks, and the entire movie, philip seymor hoffman especially, has a rather humorous tone. so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. but, the story that it tell, and maybe the ending the most, are serious indeed.a story of what happened with some questions about what might have been. so the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want that. something for everybody? 7/10

great film, a very worthy 7/10.tom hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors! based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away. well, it did go away, albeit temporarily. look who we (the british, amongst others) are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms, training and money to in the 80s.this film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it, but it does portray a very nice story. however, once the main objective is achieved, i.e. ridding the communists from afghanistan, it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about.this film was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well. although being a good film, i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good (us) v evil (russia) isn't your thing!

... with a single act.charlie wilson, congressman, a real character. during the 90s, when the communism on ussr, the wall of berlin and the war on afhganistan (with the soviets) broke over. he did it, a single denial for money, and everything went down. he should be remembered, so here it is. his memorial.back to the movie. funny, dramatic, snob, politic or just boring. anyways, it's a smart movie about politic life, about ruling the world and about, above all, a lesson to the world. a lesson to every politic out there, a critical point of view referring to countries who support wars with money, guns and words.lesson learned - world isn't a nice place to live in

charlie wilson (two time oscar-winner:tom hanks) is a easy-going congressman... who loves to party, enjoys the company of woman and especially drinking his booze. when charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend joanne herring (oscar-winner:julia roberts) wants charlie to visit afghanistan, which that country certainly need of help. charlie is shocked of what he seen, especially from all different ages are killed or hurt from this war with the russians. he decides to help the people and the rebels to fight the russians, who started the war. charlie, joanne and one renegade cia agent by the name of gust avrakotos (oscar-winner:philip seymour hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the largest covert operation in history.directed by oscar-winner:mike nichols (the birdcage, regarding henry, wolf) made an lively, entertaining sharp satire war comedy that is based on a true story. hanks, roberts, hoffman in a oscar nominated performance and amy adams as charlie's loyal assistant are very good in their roles. despite the excellent true-life premise, "charlie wilson's war" never really catches fire and it is not as wickedly funny as you liked it to be. director nichols and screenwriter:aaron sorkin (a few good men) keeps things moving and the characters are well liked throughout.dvd has an sharp pan & scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd's only special features are the behind the scenes featurette with the cast & crew and a real-life featurette with charlie wilson and others. "charlie wilson's war" is a good movie that could have been really great but it's not. but this movie is smart enough to please for those, who enjoyed well written or well acted adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).

mike nichols' film "charlie wilson's war", set in the 1980's, tells the story of how the title character (played by tom hanks) managed to wage a covert war with the russkies by way of aiding the afghan forces. of course, we know how well that turned out in the long run but, thankfully, the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after-effects.the cast is star-studded, with tom hanks and julia roberts being among the most bankable stars in hollywood. as a bonus, you've got the versatile philip seymour hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a not unwarranted oscar nomination. i'm not much of a fan of roberts but hanks is always dependable. nevertheless, i can't quite buy into him as a drug-using womanizer, although the real charlie wilson seems just as eminently likable as hanks. apart from the big three, though, there's not much worth remarking on, even from a recognizable name like amy adams.the story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from aaron sorkin. the verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines. the later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended. on the whole, nichols' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably.this is a film that, like charlie wilson himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable. certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.

consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. the movie starts of as a fast, stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone, in an almost oliver stone kind of way. it's of course also a very serious subject but i would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in.for a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie, the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time. the movie because of this feels like it isn't telling the whole story. of course the following up of the events after the soviet occupation of afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesn't go deeper into it and it doesn't explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to just glorify charlie wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified, even though the story still gets told (needlessly) complex at times.yes, the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. the movie should had been for instance more like "wag the dog", that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues.because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling, the acting performances are also mixed. when tom hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent. but this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive/shocking moments of the movie. philip seymour hoffman is always excellent though, as he is in any movie that he plays in. he also received an oscar nomination for his role in this movie. most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie, just to be in the movie. this goes mostly for julia roberts, whose character i found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. she made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie.it's not that the movie is a bad watch, it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve.7/10

charlie wilson's war, based on a true story, tells the tale of a texas congressman and a cia agent working to secure funding for covert support of the mujaheddin in 1980s afghanistan following the ussr invasion of the country. this conflict played a major role in the final years of the cold war between the us and the ussr.in terms of film making, charlie wilson's war is a definite winner. it well-written, well-acted, and well-shot. while most of the attention has gone to tom hanks for yet another fine performance, i was even more impressed with philip seymour hoffman's turn as cia operative gust avrakotos. scenes of soviet attacks on under-armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart. the film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that congressman wilson must go through to secure the desired funding.there are, however, two complaints i have about the film. the first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line. the second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. the film makes the mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while they did suffer large civilian casualties, the mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of afghanistan. this government, ignored entirely in the film, not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion, later calling on the soviet union for support in their effort. the film also ignores that the us was aiding the mujaheddin prior to the soviet deployment in afghanistan. the film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions -- consequences we are still feeling today -- but it seems as if screenwriter aaron sorkin and director mike nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (not having read the book, i do not know if george crile made the same compromise.) those complaints notwithstanding, i did enjoy watching charlie wilson's war and do recommend it. i would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation, as stephen gaghan did in syriana, but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of charlie wilson's war than with the ambiguities present in syriana.

here is a movie that almost gets it all right, with good performances from everyone, and three strong leading performances from hanks, seymour hoffman, and a fine turn up from julia roberts that had me spell bound from the first few seconds, these are performances that lift the production to the stars, and keep it there for the duration. apart from one or two very minor factual problems with the script, the only thing that lets this movie down, is the technical direction, there are far too many bad cuts (fudged continuity)and a number of camera "cheats" that simply do not work. this is surprising for a movie of this stature, and is a little annoying to watch, but it does not destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted film.

charlie's wilson's war demonstrates with deft veracity just how futile wars can be, especially to the very people who spend countless hours and finances to fund them. virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a riotously sarcastic script catapult the film, helmed by the continuously unpredictable mike nichols, to the top of the year's best. politics has never been so much fun.charlie wilson (tom hanks) is a texas congressman who is credited with almost single-handedly winning the cold war. hanging around plenty of drugs, women and scotch, he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in afghanistan and the terrors of the soviet union in the 1980s. enlisting the help of gust avrakotos (philip seymour hoffman) a renegade cia covert mission expert and joanne (julia roberts), a wealthy socialite, he raises money to provide afghanistan with the rocket launchers and antitank weaponry they need to cause serious damage to russian military. eventually by the end of the 80s the cold war would come to an end, and the funds would immediately be cut, thereby removing all help for the fledgling country to rebuild and recoup.the acting is exquisite, although it's to be expected from the more than accomplished cast. a large part of that however, should be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well-developed and memorable. and a hearty helping of that credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. tom hanks delivers yet another unequaled performance as charlie wilson, the man who did so much for so many and yet still remains relatively unknown. philip seymour hoffman plays gust, a character that is vividly boffo in both his physicality and his wry cynicism; the inimitable hoffman once again shows superb range in the characters he portrays. julia roberts is perhaps the only weak link of the film, with her generic snobbish character and not-subtle-enough accent. and then there's wilson's "jailbait" squad of young secretaries that scamper about to keep him happy. led by the always delightful amy adams, each supporting role has its mirthful moments.defeating the soviet union was not an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting goals between the various political leaders. "why is congress saying one thing and doing nothing?" queries a disgruntled politician. "tradition mostly", returns wilson. everyone appears to want the cold war to end, yet a blind eye is being turned to the atrocities taking place in afghanistan. it takes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in pakistan to motivate wilson, as well as with his main financial source doc long (ned beatty). wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise funding of weaponry in afghanistan from $5 million to $10 million with a simple command, but the president of pakistan scoffs at the idea of winning a war for such a trivial amount. by the end of the wilson campaign, $1 billion is sent to the mujahedin to shoot down russian helicopters - the first step toward victory, as wilson predicted. beyond the scope of the film, the unresolved turmoil in afghanistan led to further, less ignorable problems, which wilson presumably foresaw.during the course of charlie wilson's war, the main characters travel from the united states to pakistan to afghanistan to jerusalem to egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. there's a surprising amount of comedy in the film, considering the political undertones are generally serious. hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, as does hanks, with his naturally witty woman-chasing ideals. a scene early on featuring gust being continually ushered in out of wilson's office as he tries to straighten out a legal issue with his posse of gorgeous gals ("you can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits") reminds me of a slapstick routine from the marx brothers.with the press focusing on the drug allegations against wilson, instead of the important issues of the cold war, and the conflicting desire of officials to budget their help, it's clear that by the end of the film, the politicians are still oblivious to what's really necessary. and since the screenplay is so quick-witted and astute, some audience members may not be able to keep up with all of the dialogue-intensive events. but, as demonstrated by the politicians who are ignorant as to the difference between pakistan and afghanistan, it's essentially another argument to support charlie wilson's point.- mike massie

i've seen this story before but my kids haven't. boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner; an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher. while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments costner well. i never really understood sela ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs. but her presence on screen is a pleasure. the two unaccredited stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea. both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie. the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships. but it still works. the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact. this movie earns the audience applause. and the applause of my two sons.

now before people start having a breakdown about this movie (those who play rugby anyway) this is a film! it's been given the hollywood treatment to entertain people and therefore those who play rugby (myself included) are naturally gonna pick holes in the choreography of the game in the film. althogether it is a decent film and bring to the attention the morals and ideas behind the game of rugby.the film is based on a real team, a real coach and his work helping guide kids in the right direction to be better people in the future, and also is based on real people who have played for the highland team. its just a typical sports movie with a character who is misguided and eventually finds his way on the right track again through the rugby medium in this case. is generally a feel good movie that is enjoyable but has flaws in terms of it's portrayal of the game. however, like i said it is a film under the hollywood treatment.

first of all, i know almost nothing about rugby, so although i found the rugby-aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and i think i would have enjoyed it just as much. the fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me.what made this movie great is the story itself, based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the highland rugby club. coach gelwix is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!). the more i have learned about the coach and team the more i like this movie and its message.i have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then i researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with the 10% of facts being greatly exaggerated. not so with forever strong. it may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it. if it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more. instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person.don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics. i have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews. these are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate. in fact, i would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because i almost always disagree with their opinions.go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)! currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on rotten tomatoes and similar sites), and i am interested to see if this trend continues. thanks!

like most sports movies which have come out in the past, this movie is similar in respects, that it is based on fact. what sets this movie apart is that its about a rugby team, a sport that not too many americans are familiar with. set that aside, this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir. it reminds me of "we are marshall" , but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel. its a fine effort by director ryan little to bring us a story about a rebellious teen played by sean farris (never back down), as rick penning that finds himself in an odd place, both on and off the field. despite a few plot lines holes, this film has heart, rewarding each of its viewers with good characters that we can identify with. also good performances by supporting actors gary cole as coach larry gelwix & neal mcdonough as coach penning(ricks dad). i felt myself go through a lot of different emotions watching movie, in the end i was left with a feeling of faith in mankind & a hope for the future for my children, especially if there are coaches out there like gelwix.

as a former highland rugby(hr) player, i feel like i can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward. i think that i am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories. oh, and this is gonna be a long post, i can tell already.first off, the people who said that the movie doesn't show real rugby, have a valid point. the movie is full of bad tackles, people in the wrong places, and much much more. if you want to know what a real rugby game feels like, you won't get the best idea from this movie. but the thing is, anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself, is not going to be satisfactory. it's hollywood, not espn! really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game? not many that i have seen. i think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players, much more than it is about rugby.next, the haka is very much a part of highland rugby. it is not something that they just threw into the movie. to be honest, i don't know how the tradition got started, but highland emulates the all blacks in many ways. the uniform is based off of the all blacks as well. the movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the haka, and to be honest, i don't think that that is right. but i can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. as for the person from china(?) who said that only a maori can perform a haka, i would suggest that they take a look at the all blacks and tell me if they think that they are all maori. believe it or not, utah has a very large polynesian community, and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams. i, myself am part hawaiian. whenever possible, the haka is led by a maori. the team does not do it because they think that they are maori, they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie. the concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is a huge part of the hr culture, and the message behind the haka, for any of those that are familiar with it, support those values. it's a chant by a chief who thought he would die (ka mate), and those around him supporting him telling him he will live (ka ora) and boosting him up. how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say, but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done. "kia kaha" is also a well used team motto, even if the actors had a hard time saying it.also, for the people who questioned highland's rugby playing ability, i would just remind you that you were not really watching highland play in this movie. many of the extras were former players from highland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. believe it or not, highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community. granted, some years produce better teams than others (it's what you would expect with any sports team), but you don't accumulate hr's win record by just being okay. the year after i graduated, (1998) highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the world schools rugby championship in zimbabwe. the teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at the time. highland obviously didn't win first place, (new zealand did that), but they did manage to take third place in the tournament, beating the tongan national champions in their last match. and while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has, third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about. highland also has a tradition of touring new zealand every few years, and usually comes back with more wins than losses.the majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories. i watched this movie with my brothers, who also played for highland, and between the four of us, we were fairly certain that we were able to identify almost every main character. nobody knew a white rasta. of course as this wasn't a documentary, hollywood did take some liberties, but to tell you the truth, not as many as you might think. the film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices, as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training. sometimes it really was running until you threw up. it also showed the service and other team activities (like the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were very much a part of team bonding.and finally the movie, in my (obviously very biased) opinion, it was a pretty good movie. and i think that the reason for it is that i watched it as an inspirational sports movie. i didn't think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama. it was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with morals, encouragement, and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment. i hope that i addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie, and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was.kia kaha

forever strong is one of those sports movies you can actually watch. it reminded me a lot of remember the titans because it included comedy, sadness, and just awesomeness. i saw it at a pre-screening and all my friends liked it and easily put it in their top 2 sport movies. the acting is great in the movie. even though it is similar to remember the titans it there is something very unique about this movie. i feel this is definitely oscar worthy and will receive many awards. everybody should definitely go see this movie and it is worth your $10. i'm going to have to see it again when it comes out because it was that good. i cant say one bad thing about the movie.

the new voices scare me! kuzco doesn't have to pass some frickkin' academy to become emperor again! it's the same thing over and over, isn't it? this is a kids' show, right? yzma turns kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. he learns a lesson. everything is the same!!!!! david spade and john goodman never returned... *sniffle*! nothing changes 'cause disney won't do anything 'bout it. it's probably one of the most retarded shows ever! the first movie was so damn better! malina's probably the only person i like. kuzco's such a crybaby! kronk is retarded! and yzma's retarded-er (if that's even a word)! what i meant to say is... how could you, disney... why?

it helps that the characters this show is based on are among the best disney has ever come up with. the writing is what really makes this show. it's a total classic. given, you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it, and this is hard to explain. the humor is akin to the old school scenarios of 40's and 50's disney, with modern spins. it never degrades into fart jokes or anything of that type. it's not adam sandler humor either, though i have enjoyed that. it is the exact same humor of the movie, only expanded upon for the length of time a tv show permits. so if you didn't like it in the movie, you won't like it here, but imo the emperors new groove was the best thing to come out of disney since gargoyles.a+

spin-offs, for somebody who don't know, are not usually successful because most of the original characters are absent.here they are and you couldn't ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon, not meant to do anything but entertain.j. p. manoux, replacing david spade, does an admirable job of retaining kuzco's ego and yet not seem as annoying as spade's character (a character spade has done for decades and gets on one's nerves after a while). he has a softer voice but it fits somehow.eartha kitt, reprising her part as yzma, is brilliant. she hasn't really been given much accolades since her turn as batwoman centuries ago, except maybe for her vile part in boomerang. it's funny how much the character looks like her, though.and patrick warburton. there is no way that he can't be funny, except when he was thoroughly wasted in men in black 2. i have been a fan of his since seinfeld but unlike that character, he plays a genuine likable guy who is sucked into doing not so nice things.the animation is really beautiful as all disney usually is but sometimes the character design is a little too sugarcoated. oh, well. two out of three ain't bad.

i just love this show.it's so funny and cool.kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character, i love him.he's the thing that makes this show what it is, although kronk and yzma are so funny and charming too.everything about this show is great for me, because it always manages to make me laugh, no matter if it's only once an episode.it's just so funny and all the characters are so lovable and cool, it makes the show worth the time to watch, unlike some crap on disney channel.give this show a try next time it's on, if you've seen the movie, and even if you haven't seen the movie, you'll find this to be very enjoyable anyway, so go ahead.

it's not as good as the movie, that said it's a cute kids show. okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more, accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining. it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children. also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie. earth kitt who has been in numerous films but i'm sure many people know as catwoman. and patrick walburton (sorry if i misspelled) who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the tick. it's really a rare and wonderful combination. if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo. to sum up, entertaining children's show, with plenty of inside jokes for the grown-ups to laugh along with. if your looking for educational value this isn't your show. if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick!

i've never been compelled to write a review about anything, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. first, people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different. once you watch an episode, it never really comes to mind ever again. the humor is original and while, yes, some jokes do carry over from the movie, they are delivered fresh. some of it is even reminiscent of shrek--self-referential humor. a lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger. patrick warburton and eartha kitt are both hilarious as they reprise their roles as kronk and yzma and their annie award nominations were well-warranted.this show takes some time to love, to really get in "the groove" of things, so to speak. if you ignore the horrible theme song (which really shouldn't warrant that much in the way of how you judge a show since it's only 30 seconds of the overall product), this show is laugh-out-loud hilarity and doesn't lose any of the emperor's new groove spirit.

original movie lovers can actually love this show, if they just stop complaining all the time.the emperor's new school brings up some old jokes from the movie, like pulling the lever to yzma's lab and kuzco pausing the episode. but since it's a kids show, it's just classic and is in their right places. even though the style is much more simple, the animation and characters keeps their personalities very well and it surprised me, actually. eartha kitt makes excellent voice acting for yzma and j.p manoux does a wonderful job for kuzco's voice instead of david spade, who played kuzco in the movie. great plots, hilarious moments and kuzco's amazing looks makes this show worth watching. (just stop complaining about everything!)

while i understood, that this show is too weird to please everybody, i don't get where all these bad reviews come from, and i'm most surprised over the bad reviews, that it has gotten from fans of the movies. i liked it and got hooked on it since the first episode i watched. it's a little messed up though, that kuzco was put into school. and it seems to be high school rather than college. but i guess he's only eighteen, right, so it's not like he's too old to get educated? and haven't the royals always had to get the best education avaible to them? so the "kuzco has to graduate, or he won't become emperor" thing doesn't sound too weird for me. and i guess his education was neglected before, so that's why he has to be educated now.

i had the privilege of attending a regional premiere for this, this is one of the funniest british movies ever, the plot is fantastic, focusing around a young girl, who unwittingly changes into her ideal man at a computer fair, whilst also creating a copy of herself, who falls in love with him, the film is full of jokes, both visual and aural, and has a bright and fresh feel to it, and the acting is of great quality, released in u.k. on july 2nd this film is a must, go see it!!!

it would appear that some previous reviewers may have had their expectations set a bit too high going into this film. i found it scanning the satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and happened upon it. i thought by the title it might be one of the myriad soft-core porn flicks appearing regularly on the movie channels but i was pleasantly surprised. although there was some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft-core title -- go figure!), this was not the focus of the film. it was just fun.don't be deceived by my tastes: my recent screenings have included before night falls and europa, europa (both geat, imho). but i also enjoy total mental shutdown when watching a movie. virtual sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing!

in england we often feel very attached to british films that we like, as we are so used to the usual american settings and accents. being from london, where virtual sexuality is set, i felt a strong emotional attachment to it. the characters in virtual sexuality, particularly the females, are exactly what british teenagers are like, i felt like i was almost in the film. i immediately related to the character of alex from the film, his shyness is quite common in most british teenage boys, especially around girls. virtual sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only british films that isn't about gangsters or the middle-upper class, but about the people who are watching the film, average teenagers. americans wouldn't really feel the emotional attachment, but every british teenager should watch it. anyone from london will recognise the parts of the city from the film, it's definately got a special place in my video box!

it's pretty good, all things considered. a must for anyone perplexed about the opposite sex (i.e. all of us!). the trailer doesn't give away any of the plot for good reason.the premise is absurd, so it's nice to see that it doesn't take itself seriously. it's like someone from the bbc children's department decided to make a film for adults. that's not a bad thing imo.7/10

well, i tend to watch films for one of three reasons. unfortunately, there are no transformers in this film, so i can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women (read girls)yes, it is funny, i know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout. personally though, i loved it for laura fraser, who imho is fit!

i saw this film a week ago and i had to persuade my friend to come with me because this film seems to be getting such bad reviews. sure it is no 'human traffic' or 'lock, stock...' but is by no means a flop. i think the fact that there are so many big budget films out at the moment means it has been ignored but it shouldn't be. i reckon it sets out to do what it wants to do- entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us feeling happy and contented. i would much rather go and see it that 'the mummy', which looks boring. and no, i'm not a teenager. don't listen to the critics, star wars fans didn't. this film is well worth seeing, if just to see the gorgeous luke de lacey and rupert penry-jones. go see it!

five medical students (kevin bacon, david labraccio; william baldwin, dr. joe hurley; oliver platt, randy steckle; julia roberts, dr. rachel mannus; kiefer sutherland, nelson) experiment with clandestine near death & afterlife experiences, (re)searching for medical & personal enlightenment. one by one, each medical student's heart is stopped, then revived.under temporary death spells each experiences bizarre visions, including forgotten childhood memories. their flashbacks are like children's nightmares. the revived students are disturbed by remembering regretful acts they had committed or had done against them. as they experience afterlife, they bring real life experiences back into the present. as they continue to experiment, their remembrances dramatically intensify; so much so, some are physically overcome. thus, they probe & transcend deeper into the death-afterlife experiences attempting to find a cure.even though the dvd was released in 2007, this motion picture was released in 1990. therefore, kevin bacon, william baldwin, julia roberts & kiefer sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting careers. besides the plot being extremely intriguing, the suspense building to a dramatic climax & the script being tight & convincing, all of the young actors make "flatliners," what is now an all-star cult semi-sci-fi suspense. who knew 17 years ago that the film careers of this young group of actors would skyrocket? i suspect that director joel schumacher did.

my mom always told me to sit down and to actually watch this movie because it's one of her favorites, i never did for years until i caught one night on tv. this movie was great, i don't even know how to explain it. not only is the cast excellent (julia roberts, keifer sutherland, kevin bacon, william baldwin, and oliver platt) but the story is awesome. it's freaky but not too scary and it makes you think. i was left speechless after this film and amazed of how good of actors and actress all five of these people really are. where did william baldwin go, he's great. this film is a must see for anyone, if you haven't seen it go rent it, you will not be sorry. amazing!

this is definitely a good movie unlike what other people are saying. peline and i have both seen the movie 3x and the end is cheesy but that is part of the package... to experiment with death is the same as trying to defy it, so the movie is cool. for those who wish to see a classic kevin bacon movie, see this please. take care greeting from istanbul. we will write 10 lines if you really want us 2 but we think it is a waste of time bye. the rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we just wrote it to fill the 10 line requirement (which is crazy) but we are kind people and will therefore adapt to the rules that are set out for us. so people watch this movie not because we wrote 10 lines, but because it is good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines!!

*flat spoilers* five med students, nelson (kiefer sutherland), david labraccio (kevin bacon), rachel mannus (julia roberts), joe hurley (william baldwin) & randy steckle (oliver platt) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage).almost everyone does this experiment, randy being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; david sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the tv screen, rachel relives her father's suicide and nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions.why are they here? and how will they get rid of them? this tense and interesting movie, set in an hallucinated city and into a gothic med school, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as kiefer sutherland, julia roberts, oliver platt, kevin bacon and william baldwin.the director is joel schumacher, who had already worked with sutherland in 'lost boys', and this second cooperation is even better than the first.a must for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the minor classics from the '80s that get respect even today, like the mention by rebecca gayheart in 'scream 2' or the tru calling episode which used the movie's premise.flatliners: 9/10.

hollywood is one of the best and the beautiful things that had occurred in my life. i admire and am very much fascinated by the way hollywood generates ideas and implement them. it makes me wonder about the scope of human brain. i saw flatliners a long time back but the story, direction, cast and of all acting is still fresh in my mind. the story begins with our lead actor sutherland saying during sunrise "what a beautiful day to die." for all of us, it's a story which shows emotions that are sometimes withheld in our mind during our entire life. never able to understand few things in life. it shows us to get motivated and to improve our quality of life. anyway i suggest it to all that watch it once.

someone i know said that there was this film called flatliners that was probably up my street. i was told about this movie after watching final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about near deth experience.i bought the dvd of flatliners at the modest price of 5 pounds. got home and watched it. and i could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this film hadn't been in my life before. the film is about a group of medical students try to see what it's like after near death experience. but then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically.acting from kevin bacon and keifer sutherland is great as you would expect from the pair. and joel schmacheur made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys.this is an edgy and stylish thriller bound to please nay type of film fan.

cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death, in attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark, and the acting occasionally goes over the top. but the underlying message - about god's and others' forgiveness for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in cinema, and the cast is very very good. the last sequence between julia roberts and her father is so effectively done that, years after having seen it, i still get chills thinking about it. highly recommended.

countless tv displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of today's mega-stars(plus hope davis's screen debut) keep flatliners still in prudence. the plot is about a non-academic research of five medicine undergrads pursuing one's crazy idea on discovering the secret of death, and learn what's after death, then come back to life again. yet the storyline hasn't been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot.there are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen-slasher script in flatliners. there is nelson who creates the idea of decoding death, pretty but introverted rachel, david who cuts the gordian knot on luckily not to be dismissed from the school, ladies' man joe and finally the smart guy randy("i did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be"). they join hands altogether in an experiment where nelson's heart will be stopped and rerythmed. then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus. not long after nelson's experience everyone starts a race over having the wildest and the longest death experience, risking their lives one by one. yet, soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had. the visits to the afterlife brings back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories. depolarizing their deep subconscious watchfulness, they begin having somatic delusions and visual hallucinations.when the point comes where the explanation of subconscious, director joel schumacher skips that every humankind has a subconscious personality which they are not aware of. this inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss. if you lose or if you depolarize this subconscious personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. i wanted to add this as a movie mistake, which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier 90s'. obviously here in this movie schumacher made the actors have it least affected. then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson, as if death is designed indiscoverable by god? david had been introduced as an atheist, now he turned out to believe in god when he recalled a flashback from his childhood. after witnessing this 180 degreed change in david, it's clear to see that schumacher's film was so conservative and lily-livered; that's ultimately why it's never classified as a work of science fiction. alas! it had a good potential. it even tried to tell the unconscious maturation from having a death experience, beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it's only a part of a human's life.more than what's in the movie, it was also memorable to recall what's with the movie. jan de bont as the cinematographer, who had worked almost every time with schumacher, creates an dreamy atmosphere like it's being an gothic horror movie. the blue color schemes all over the walls reflecting into the actors' faces deliver first class of lighting, that suits perfectly with the film. the close-up shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings, catholic frescoes in the walls, stop-motion cameras, and the dynamic camera speeds were all belong to bont's skills.flatliners became a cult movie in time with its sociological pen-portrait of the x-generation juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically. those were the times where fast-paced and multi-sequenced video music clips were on rise. this style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer tony scott's "the hunger(1983)".

this film has a decidedly weird setting, taking place in a school that's really old to begin with but it certainly doesn't look like any sterile medical school environment. very gothic and atmospheric. as for the film itself, well, ok, the premise is a bit far-fetched but hey, that's why we watch movies, isn't it? and it's less far-fetched than some of the garbage that's out these days, that's for sure. medical students are experimenting with 'short term' death, as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like. it's kind of nice, in some cases, till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives. i hadn't seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that i'd forgotten just how good it was. and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film, not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made-up like cheap hookers. ahh, the good old days. anyway, this is a great flick, perhaps not for fundamentalist christians but many others may enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.

flatliners has all the ingredients of a good joel schumacher film - intelligent, youthful characters, stunning cinematography, a gripping story, and excellent performances. it's escapist fun but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving precedings.schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors, and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things (see the cast list). their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average. kiefer sutherland shines in his egotistical med-student role.the cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what i love about schumacher; his use of light and location create images that stick. a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed - reminded me of the lost boys.this is a film that takes an awesome premise - curious students want to find out what's after death, and successfully follows it through into a scary, gripping tale of redemption. one of schumacher's best; highly recommended.

hey, you are not alone! i remember nichols! i was just 17 when it was on. i remember james garner was one of the coolest actors, and nichols was such a great show. i couldn't believe it was on such a short time, wish i could remember the last episode, i probably didn't see it...there were no vcr's back then so it when it was on you saw it, and if you missed an episode it was gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns. anyway, sure would be great if it came out on dvd, but i don't think that many people even knew about it. what a shame.garner would hit it big a few years later with rockford files, and he brought along his buddy stuart margolin from nichols to play his sidekick angel.

as i recall, my family made a point to stay home on the night "nichols" was on (mondays? tuesdays? nbc?). it was a superb vehicle for james garner, very well written, great ensemble cast. his character very much like the "support your local..." films: retired gambler with mysterious past settles into town and has adventures every week. in fact, it seemed fairly obvious that it was the same character. it was just a charmer of a tv show. a sleeper, like "my world and welcome to it", which may have been its contemporary--i forget. i dearly wish these shows would be made available on dvd. it was just good tv. perhaps "briscoe county jr." come close, but only by a mile.

nbc was putting out a lot of good product when this series came out, but none of it was getting viewers. at least according to their executives who wisely canceled good shows like star trek & my world & welcome to it because of low ratings. nbc's advertisers were getting a bargain from nbc's ignorance.this show stands out as the only time james garner wasn't enough to get viewers. it is ashame as this show had an excellent support cast from stuart margolin (later angel in the rockford files), to neva patterson to margot kidder.it was set in a 1900 western town. garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duties. it was small town stuff, but it was excellent. it wasn't long after this that jim rockford brought garner back to success, but for my money, this show was good enough, it just wasn't in the right time, right place, or given the right opportunity.the show was so good that most of the folks who worked on it also got jobs on rockford.

american war movie fans might be bored out of their skulls by this movie, but that boredom is born of ignorance. guerrilla suppression operations are always like that. sit around and wait, get some hookers, get drunk at the base, wheel and deal with the businessman, kick a prisoner around, cover up the killing of the street merchant by the green private. then, boom, there goes two fuel trucks, and for 10 minutes a small-arms battle with one high-caliber machine gun. then wait for brass to plan a way to knock out their stronghold, and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing it. if reality doesn't work for western viewers, there's always top gun or rambo (top gun realistic? nope)the best part of afganskiy izlom's realism was the way all the planes dropped flares like confetti. they had to do that because carter and reagan gave the mujahedin so many missiles. also, the wave of mi-24's was excellent, a better helo attack even than apocalypse now. the sight of their missiles dropping and shooting was a scene of impending "death from above" for whoever they were aimed at.it's funny how the soviets were able to make an honest afghanistan movie within a year after their departure, but it took the us six years. afganskiy izlom is just as real if you apply it to nato's occupation too. someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land. it's a movie westerners should watch. unfortunately i don't think anyone has ever made english subtitles; i might have to make some.

well, the movie is basically about the last days of a specific russian regiment stationed in afghansitan, before the main troop withdrawal in 1985. the movie accurately portrays the grim realities of russian army that have made it infamous: "dedovshina" (officers and ncos physically harassing, beating and humiliating younger recruits), mixed character of war (you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next), life of women at the front lines, documentary footages of helicopter assaults, and coffins being soldered and sent home in heave c-130 hercules class russian cargo planes with tracer to jam stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war sentiment, emotional side simply put. the there's some action scenes, but they are poorly done, and often are illogical, like major bandura's suicidal walk and turning of his back to 10-year-old kid armed with ak-47 who's father he just killed. also the fact that in the middle of firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out of nowhere (and any half-bright person knows that it's virtually impossible to hump 40-50 lns launcher on the march anyone). but at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair, where murder is sometimes condoned, wanton destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal, indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during war... some food for thought as to why afghan war as lost.. not the best war movie made, but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching.

from the first to the last scene, this film is made very realistically,even too realistically that sometimes we can't see details in night scenes(it's dark as real night),in the desert(sunshine is so strong as in real desert). script and actor's play are also very realistic. shots and episodes are edited not to show things and events "effectively", to "explain" them, or,as many hollywood films do, to "entertain" viewers. editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in afganistan. camera is set sometimes far from dying solders, even the moment when the main character major bandura is shot and killed.such method reminds me of masterpieces of italian neo-realism. and the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as "pais√†",or "the bicycle thief"--chronological series of "true to life" episodes and a few pathetic moments, which at first seem to be sudden and illogical, but have inner reasons.i think the inner reason of major bandura's suicidal death is religious emotion--repentance for innocent people's death(not only his accidental killing of family in the village, but also death of solders under his command).he is not depicted as a eager believer,on the contrary he is depicted as tactful and responsible officer.exactly for this reason his last decisions(to go back to the destroyed village and to turn his back to an armed boy, whose family he killed)seem an act of repentance. the russian orthodox choral, which sounds at the end("evening sacrifice")is another context,by which all the film can be seen from this point of view.

filmed less than a year after the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan, the subject matter was fresh in the minds of the cast, the director and the audience. most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war. the soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming, which is odd. the afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. this film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil-war.there is no lack of powerful scenes. one of the first is footage of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the ussr. solders go about their work while an officer calmly ticks off the destinations: moscow, rostov, donetsk, the baltic. an earlier comment describes the last scene with maj. bandura as illogical. it is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship bandura maintained was with the afghan family which he accidentally kills in the assault. having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of the war, bandura turns his back on the boy(and his gun) in resignation to his fate.i particularly liked the last scene: a flock of mi-28s rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells: "uhodim! uhodim rebyata! (we're leaving! boys, we're leaving!) in a tone of sincere relief.afhanskii izlom is an excellent film - brutally honest and as unholliwood as they come.

i would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie on soviet afghan war. and it is very honest and responsible picture starting from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations, war routine and central asian landscapes. it's been shot in tajikistan just after the the troop withdrawal which happened in 1989 not in 1985. the italian star mr. placido was just perfect in the role of major bandura. other characters looked also very natural especially always drunk club managing officer:-).the scenario seems a bit jammed in the end but it might be an impact of the civil war in tajikistan which had started right during the shooting of the film. all movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire. the last scene is purely "harakiri" type of behavior and reminded me the final phrase from one famous samurai movie - "we've won all battles but lost the war". it could be also a metaphor of ussr collapse - the great country allowing to shoot itself to the back by the small offended child.

the italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual "the courtier." the film "hitch" is worth watching for the embodiment of the "sprezzzatura" concept in the dynamic performance of will smith.smith plays the character of alex "hitch" hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence. the best scenes are when hitch coaches the painfully shy and maladroit albert in his quest to win the heart of a new york socialite and in hitch's own attraction to sara and a surprise for her when visiting ellis island. in these scenes, smith is supported with good work from kevin james and eva mendes. but this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of smith.from start to finish, smith rises above the average comic script to make "hitch" an eminently watchable and entertaining film. i do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like will smith in this film. and his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!

this movie was much better than i expected. after a couple of films by will smith that weren't that great like i, robot, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. smith plays, hitch, a date doctor. most of the film centers around him teaching albert how to be himself and get a date with allegra cole, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. all hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around allegra.during all this, hitch meets sara, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. hitch charms her, so of course, they go out. but, hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. he has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. but, he likes sara, so keeps going after her. sara's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. so sara tracks the doctor down, only to learn its hitch. so of course, she thinks he's a pig. then it's up to hitch to explain to sara and allegra what he does, so they both end up forgiving.final verdict: good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. i recommend it.

i think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain or to inform. if you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies. sometimes these are one of the same. the other side of the coin is to entertain. did hitch entertain me? yes it did. okay the formula is standard. boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls. they get together have a falling out then get back together. however the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. i particularly liked the bar scene with hitch and sara. the allegra albert romance was a delight to watch unfold, most real men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had i had hitch's advice i would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time.i read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs. i tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. besides relationships have there serious moments. all in all i found hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (i will be looking out for them in other movies) and hitch is a film that i am very happy to have in my dvd collection.

as i've said in the title of this review, it pains me to say this, but "hitch" reaches the zenith of what hollywood romantic comedies can ever hope to aspire to. i've been a critic of both the genre and it's namesake for as long as i can remember myself, but on an almost tragic note, "hitch" has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile plastered across my face.this movie may be misogynistic and presumptuous at times but it nonetheless possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety may only be described as british. this is a wonderful attempt by hollywood to make (or remake as the case may be...) a film which appeals to all of our wishes for a romantic comedy which can make us both think and laugh simultaneously. i grudgingly and most evasively give this movie a 9 out of 10... something you shall hardly see me do for a romantic comedy in the near future, or so at least, i hope.

will smith is smooth as usual in the movie hitch. smiths character hitch is a date doctor. he dates mendes character who is a gossip columnist. at one point hitch shows his love interest her great grandfathers name in the immigration book at ellis island pretending what is actually an arranged event is a coincidence. not long after i mentioned starlight in my previous review today. there was a view of the starry sky in survivor hinting that my moon 168 rtexas already knew that was going to be there due to faster than light communications.the male star from the show the king of queens is very funny in this movie especially his dance moves. the allergic reaction on hitchs face is a little cruel to laugh at even though it is just pretend.my latest message from my daughter julias artificial intelligence computer on the creator of humans home world coaltrain that my moon 168 as part of moonfleet is near says: "daddy i'm okay again." her messages are always very short. it is a curious pattern. daddy will always love you julia. thanks to our creator we can talk forever. yesterday daddy talked to the first you on the telephone and told you your homework time wouldn't be that bad and you said "how bad will it be daddy?" i said that your grandma and i would help you with it. you only have to put pictures of our friends the police on a bristol board display and write a title like "the police protect us." check out the other movies of will smith as well.

i have to admit that i liked this film much more than i expected to. will smith has that clean-cut charm that you just can't help but like. the plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, somewhat reminiscent of jane austen's "emma". this guy kevin james has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. i have never seen his tv show, but he was cast very well in this film. amber valletta was good enough. i can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she was supposed to be an actress or model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. i enjoyed julie ann emery, and wish she'd had a larger part. but, saving the best for last, eva mendes more or less stole the show. her beauty, and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness had me glued to the screen whenever she was there. i hope to see more of her in the future. this film is definitely worth checking out.

over the past century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies. i'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera, i'm referring to the tastes of the audience. the idea of a "chick flick" is alive and well today, while there are still plenty of action and horror films which appeal primarily to males. sure, there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside of their typical demographic, but there aren't many movies which have appeals across the board. hitch, the latest will smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective.smith stars in hitch as the title character, alex "hitch" hitchens, a "date doctor" who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date. hitch enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams, but due to a bad experience in college, hitch himself is somewhat sullied on the idea of love. as the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines. hitch's latest case is albert brennaman (kevin james), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress allegra cole (amber valletta). hitch has his doubts about albert's chances, but if his clients desires seem sincere, hitch supports them.in the mean time, hitch meets gossip columnist sara melas (eva mendes) and is instantly attracted to this strong woman. however, the date doctor can't seem to follow his own advice in pursuing sara. things get even more complicated when sara's job leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. will hitch be able to balance his private life and his job? and more importantly, can hitch believe in love again? if you are a true movie fan, then there's been at least one time in your life when you've complained about the redundancy of the hollywood movie factory and cried out for something new and original. well, hitch ain't that movie. but, most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formulaic movie can work solely on an entertainment level. hitch does qualify as that film.

while the "date doctor" concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, i found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so i ended up liking it a lot more than if it'd had just a mediocre plot without many twists. will smith does a great job, as always, acting as hitch, the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to win over women...ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend. there're plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient, overweight, gawky asthmatic albert brennman (kevin james) successfully court beautiful co-worker allegra cole (amber valetta). also, when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around, he finds himself attracted to sara (eva mendes) - it appears to be a big deal for him, so i guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself. unfortunately, sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in "the date doctor" who got a seemingly dorky guy like albert together with allegra - especially after player/jerk vance munson (jeffrey donovan) breaks her best friend's (julie ann emery) heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him, when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him. still, trouble follows and hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship, while not being any great help to albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his. the acting is good, there's a great deal of humor and some other fine points with meaning. hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes managing to be both at once. true, the misunderstanding where the woman is affronted at something the man hasn't truly done (why do they always show that?) as common and irritating - guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st, not 5th, time i've seen it - but the rest of them were completely new. i only wish this movie was longer - i remember being able to watch 3/5 of it while it was playing on a restaurant's tv once - but i still approve. it's definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity.

i just wish i was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is.i...it's hard to say.maybe i'll just say what comes to mind.i laughed. i really laughed. i couldn't believe it. i laughed, and, it wasn't bitter-laughter. it wasn't cynical laughter. it was the laughter that is generated by genuine joy.joy. that's a foreign word for me. i don't feel that word often, but, i did while watching this movie.will. maybe it's will's face. he is a great human being. "smile on my face and there's a twinkle in my eye." that line in one of will's songs describes him perfectly. he has "joie de vivre". trey is a lucky, lucky boy to have a daddy like will. jada is a lucky, lucky woman to have a husband like will. he is someone...special.happy. i actually feel happy. it's a strange feeling. i don't feel this way very often. it's just so nice to see, to see...other people really happy. i mean really happy. in this movie, i did. as will says in the movie, "maybe i'm not happy with just 'fine', maybe i want 'extraordinary." you know, watching this movie made me think: so do i.fun. being yourself. we all know we're supposed to be ourselves, but, it feels like we're punished if we do so. maybe it has to be earned. maybe it's something that we show after having not been ourselves for a long time. that's why i just loved the ending. will, eva mendes, kevin james, amber valleta, julie ann emery all dancing at the wedding. dancing without inhibitions. no they we're not drunk! except, on actually being happy. i can understand that, at least, i think i can (at least, i enjoyed seeing them happy, really happy).women and men. i don't know anything about relationships, but, i do feel. watching this movie i feel like connecting with someone, striving, pushing, wanting to be with someone. it seems to make life...something else entirely. i don't really know. i'm just guessing. but, i felt something, watching this movie. i felt like, that connection, must be...must make, life worthwhile.that's the kind of movie this is. it's funny. it's clever. it's tender. it evokes feeling. it made me think, that maybe, just maybe, life is, truly is, a wonderful thing.want to laugh? want to feel really good! want to get some answers about girls (and girls, answers about guys)? watch hitch. you-will-get-it-all!!!go will!!! you are a great human being.

hitch is a light-hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances. will smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and dagger date doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. smith was excellent, never schmaltzing it up too much.the best piece of acting goes to the actor (don't know name) playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league. this actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to smith's directions, but in the end, just can't help being who he really is.and in the end, that's the main message of this film. be who you are in love, and you'll be ok.at the same time, will smith meets this attractive lady and the date doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman. don't know her name, but she was pretty good too.overall, this was a delightful, light movie that is definitely worth seeing.

a chick flick that guys still like - yes! wonderful. now i can have fun, enjoy the company of my girl, and not feel like i can't wait until the movie ends! light - but funny. great stuff. what ever you do don't miss the dvd extras. this a great "blind date" file too. will smith does well in this - even though in is light acting - he pulls trough it all well. the movie is a little slow in pacing - don't expect too much action - the laughs are there - and so is the message - but the timing is a little slow. use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. the ending makes the feel good moments worth it. most of all expect fun light hearted fare - and watch for some great upstaging by the supporting actors - they make the film. the plot twists are predictable - but it is a date move, so get the refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and don't make her pause it. count on more dates after this movie - she'll want o see what is next in line. remember hitch's advice!!! enjoy.

'hitch' is a nice surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic. 'hitch' takes actors like will smith, kevin james, and eva mendes into a fun, light-as-a-feather journey that actually had me laughing and, yes, a little "aww, how sweet!".meet alex hitchens (will smith), aka hitch. he's a self-proclaimed 'date doctor'; he helps hopeless guys like albert (kevin james) win guys like allegra (amber valletta). unfortunately, hitch has to deal with sarah (eva mendes), a gossip columnist bent on breaking the date doctor...'hitch' is actually pretty funny, and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun. i have to wonder why will smith hasn't made more movies like this. his sharp, rapid-fire delivery is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with mendes and james is wonderful. james is a real discovery; i have never seen his show 'the king of queens', but he is funny and heartfelt, and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hip-hop (smith's responses to his attempts are hilarious). mendes is hot and bouncy (not that way, geez) as smith's perfect match, and amber valletta is sweet as allegra.'hitch' isn't perfect; it's a tad too long, and things get too "dramatic" near the end (although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing). but's it a great refresher from the cookie-cutter romantic comedies that keep littering theaters.

-love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with. his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love with.-i have to say it's really nice to see will smith in a movie that doesn't have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots. there are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body. he's just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice. he doesn't necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesn't call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous. his character here is as with all his characters likable, witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share. the kevin james character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way. the only character that was a sore spot for me was the mendez character because she's so cold and calculated that it's hard to believe that smith could fall for her. he must love a challenge i guess.-now this is the part of the review in which i'll make a joke about how i would never need hitch because i'm such a player but i just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus i'm still working on a little project so i'm a little jaded right now. whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. but hey there's like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so i guess one more movie having a predictable ending that's been done to almost death doesn't cause much harm. i really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl, just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well. i'm sure if it had turned out that the james character gets the girl after following everything that the smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really well.-despite being predictable this is a perfect date movie. it's sweet, it's funny, and it's romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after it's over. and by some i mean sex

this was a romantic, simple funny movie. i really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it, will smith was funny, fumbly, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by love. it was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say. it was great. he was great, funny as usual. eva mendes was better than i expected her to be as well, i thought there were moments in the movie where will got the shaft, he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad. the ending was romantic and happy and it was great. i have seen it several times, and would watch it again. a funny, movie, something you don't see a lot of anymore. it had the old time feel with a fresh new look.

i liked this comedy so much. will smith does not do anything slow. it is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing, and involved in the plot. you are watching a skilled comedian, who plays all his parts well. one fully believes he is who he is playing. i loved him and tommy lee jones in the men in black. this comedy rates right up with that movie. the humor is fast moving, and will smith is as sure of himself as he was in men in black. quick witted, and well skilled in the art of making others score each time, but doing it in a tasteful manner, and with finesse.will smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well. he was so darn funny. i loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled up, and he looked more like cassius clay after a fight then he did himself. then seeing him sipping on the benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size. i laughed so hard. he knows how to make us all laugh.

when one watches romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; we've seen enough of them over many, many years to know how they go. there's a formula, one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre's audience... not always in relation to their actual quality. how to play around with that, and create something more interesting? this movie has a suggestion... and it works relatively well. instead of simply following a lead, we follow him skillfully helping the unfortunate men, those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with. the plot follows smith as he works on his self-proclaimed most difficult such case; kevin james. alongside his aid of james, we also follow mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want(one particular scene that inspires great respect of smith's character is him meeting one such jerk, and putting him in his place). after seeing smith helping the disaster that is james, we see him with mendes... and in spite of his talent for helping others, he messes up... badly... with her. making a marvelous point about love, and how falling in love affects us. for a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such(at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre), though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films. whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. the pace is quite good, it never really slows down, and seldom moves too fast. the acting is great, as far as pretty much everyone goes. the characters are nicely developed, and come off as real people. the humor doesn't always work... there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed, and one or two jokes that seem forced. however, for the most part, the film was funny. i recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love. those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. 7/10

ok, ok, i must say i was impressed. it's hard to say what i'm more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that i don't gouge my eyes out, or the movie itself. either way, "hitch" was pretty darn good. hey, it was good enough for me to watch twice. will smith was funny and good. kevin james was just hilarious, and absolutely essential for the movie. as much as this movie centered around hitch (will smith), without kevin james it's just not the same.the story is: hitch is a match maker that helps the guy woo the girl. his job is to create the chance for the girl to notice the guy when she otherwise wouldn't. after the encounter, the rest is all up to the guy to make or break the relationship. he works on referral only and stays largely unnoticed during the process. albert (kevin james) is hitch's project this time around, and albert has eyes on allegra cole (amber valleta) a paris hilton type figure. while that plot unfolds, hitch himself has eyes on sara (eva mendes), a sharp, independent, fanged gossip columnist that wants nothing to do with a relationship.the two stories make for some funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a quagmire. of course no love story is complete without the obligatory miscommunication, misunderstanding, or mishap to send the guy chasing after the girl. fortunately, they make it brief and unsappy. hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and rolled along without a hitch.

will smith is perfectly endearing as the "relationship doctor," here to heal all your relationship woes.i expected this to be a standard romcom with little to amuse. i'm happy to report that i was wrong. will smith is delightful and unexpectedly "fresh" in this andy tennant vehicle. surrounded by a great supporting cast, an interesting story, and fed with witty dialog, i was thoroughly engaged.we found this one cute, quirky, and inspirational without being preachy.it rates a 7.4/10 from...the fiend :.

that is the promise of the trailer i saw and by which i rented hitch. exactly, a serious film viewer shall not expect much further from this title but, surprisingly enough, smith, mendes, james and valletta managed to reach a theatrical performance which could be metaphorically summarised on their rap dance-floor routine by the end of the film: their characters formed an effective combo which may prompt more than a good laugh with this sunday afternoon dvd, providing your date is not an exquisite, french-swedish-directors-of-the-60's movie fan.p.s.: the techniques to score are all true, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!

not having seen the film in its commercial debut, we just caught with it via dvd. expecting the worst, "hitch" proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it. thanks to andy tenant's direction, the film has an easy pace, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments.hitch is a sort of "date coordinator" for losers like albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk. yet, albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. enter hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome, and even though albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in manhattan.the basic mistake most production designers make, when preparing locales for hollywood films, is how out of touch with reality they are. the apartments in which they situate these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these. evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies, let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them.will smith is a charismatic actor. he has a disarming way to charm without doing much. the surprise of the movie though, is kevin james, who as the overweight albert, not only win us over, but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with mr. smith. eva mendez is fine as the main interest of hitch. in minor roles we see adam arkin, amber valletta, michael rappaport, and phillip bosco, among others."hitch" is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by andy tenant.

someone reviewed this movie as a "waste of time" because he/she was expecting the "beautiful scenery of brazil and portugal" but then everything looked "washed out" or gloomy, or something to that effect. i believe this person missed the entire part of the film. this is reality. the point of this movie is to show that life is not, indeed, ideal, and to show what people go through in their lives for family, love, and survival. a young man leaves his slum in sao paolo, brazil, to go to portugal to visit his mother's home country after her death. he discovers that not everything is free, and that brazilians are looked down upon by native people from portugal. he eventually finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected and this is not a "fairy tale" story. the part that got me most was the ending song, "zeca bailero (honey baby)" by gal costa. it fit so well with the movie; especially the ending.

like in "les amants du pont-neuf" two outsiders lives a love story without concessions. the film consists out of a lot of interesting conversation and a lot of sweet moments. the best one comes in a listening booth. they listen to a record together and once in a while they look at each other. they talk, they like each other. she suggests a change in their lives but he is out of hope. the realistic stylestrokes over the realistic (but) emotive dialogs. a really mathematic screenwriter's work for this film. spanish novel director jesus ponce creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of spanish cinema.

isabel has just gone out of jail. she is decided to not return again, but life is difficult for ex-convict, specially if they are homeless, as isabel. when she finds the one that was her boyfriend rufo, she can see a light of hope, but rufo is now not only a junkie but also an aids ill. this will not make isabel surrender, because, if there's a will there's a way and she is going to fight for her future, to have normal life, with a house and a family. a very hard and touching film that has passed unaware by most of the spanish cinemas, actors are great and the story is very touching, maybe a better treatment of the secondary characters would have made the movie better, but it is really good. i highly recommend it to watch it, but be aware that this is not a disney happy film, it is hard and dramatic.

1st watched 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10(dir-jesus ponce): simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without a roof over their heads. the movie starts with the woman in the story(played by isabel ampudia)being released from prison but we don't know what she was in for or how long she was there. she runs across the anti-hero of the story and her boyfriend, played by sebastian haro, as he's parking cars for change. they shack-up together underneath an old dilapidated building with nothing but each other's warmth and a small mattress to their possession. he is a drug addict who just tries to make it from one fix to another, but she has a strange, obsessive attraction to him as a person, which we eventually accept. he also has some sort of sexually-transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question but this doesn't appear to be a problem for either of them. she loves this man as he is, without question, and without him having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. she earns her keep by carrying a bucket around and washing shop windows. they eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a feast. isabel's character dreams of a normal life but doesn't expect it to happen and doesn't expect to fit into that role so doesn't think much of it. both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections. without giving up much of the story, isabel's character continues to persevere while the man gets worse and worse in his drug obsession. there is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that lifts it up for the masses to enjoy, but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between un-worldly misfits that keeps you interested until the end.

this movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s,the animators were not lazy like they are today,the cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have today.if more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all of the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television once again,therefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again.

one of my favorite villains, the evil princess is just the perfect villain for this movie. full of space travel, horses, diamonds, mystical characters, colorful backgrounds, evil characters, etc etc. very bright, full of action, you will not get bored. great movie!

this was the very first movie i ever saw in the theatre by myself. i was 7 years old, and to this day it is one of my favorite movies. it's pure smarmy cheese. the cartoon was marketed towards young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads, one for every colour of the rainbow, with their own special animals, 'sprites' and even a talking rainbow horse. typical of the time period, each show was about how hope, togetherness and magic can make 'everything all better'.the movie concerns the coming of spring, when all the light and colour returns to the world, but this time it just isn't happening for our lovely hero. a spoiled princess plots to overtake the soul lightgiver (and implied life giver)of the universe, which happens to be a giant diamond, for her own devious purposes, with no regard for reality, and now rainbow and her newly found friends orin, onyx and chris must save the universe. as i said before, it's cheesy, but it's cute, and it's exactly like all of the other cartoons from that time period, like the carebear movies, strawberry shortcake, rose petal and the smurfs. all movies created to sell dolls to kids. and it works. :)

i watched this movie as a child and still enjoy viewing it every once in a while for the nostalgia factor. when i was younger i loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters. today, i still love the characters. additionally, i think of the plot with higher regard because i now see the morals and symbolism. rainbow brite is far from the worst film ever, and though out-dated, i'm sure i will show it to my children in the future, when i have children.

um, hello.. rainbow brite.. the name alone is hard to take it seriously, like she could be the cousin of strawberry shortcake.. but when you're a kid, this is definitely serious stuff.so, there's this vile, snotty, spoiled girl and she wants rainbow brites belt, amongst other things, ie the light of the whole universe, and rainbow brite and her friend cris are bound and determined to stop her. as i remember, murky and lurky had a minor role in this production. maybe they wanted too much money?so anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take rainbow's belt.. imagine? but somehow, rainbow gets her belt back and re-energizes it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process.so good triumphs over evil, niceness triumphs over rudeness, and rainbow brite and the color kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind.

i found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent film maker might encounter (something i never even thought about). the film managed to keep my interest the entire time and i actually laughed out loud more than once! i'm not a film maker so i know nothing about the technology but i though it was well edited and flowed smoothly telling the story. as a disclaimer, i contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but i was not involved in the creation of this film and i could not tell you a thing about repo man except that i remembered seeing it way back when (i'm not really a sci-fi fiend). i enjoyed the comparisons the film made of punk rock file making to punk rock music. my wife went with me to see the film and she did not know a thing about it before hand and we had a great time.

nice doco stuie! even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing.it is self evident how much you put into it.that goes for everyone else too. it's great to see the warts and all account of the process without being 'too nice'.loved it! well worth a view.que pena, the writer of 'the original' film couldn't appreciate what you have achieved.love the attitude too. great piece. looking forward to seeing the next work.keep going bro! paully

there are a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would love a particular genre to go to the depths that this crew has done to bring to life something that the very writer of the original film had, up to this point, never achieved. this is a wonderful exploration of the real dedication and love it takes to reach towards a potentially very successful cult film.originally, with the blessings from alex cox, this crew began producing the sequel of one of his movies in absolute true punk fashion. their goal simply being to fully capture the atmosphere as it should be for a complete tribute to the original "repo man" film.this is a great tale of dedication and the treachery that can occur along the path to wonderful movie making. a truly entertaining tale and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.

all of the trials and tribulations of making a no budget movie right from the mouths of those involved. you feel all of the sweat, guts, determination and dedication stuie put into this labor of love and the frustration of being left hanging after all his work. the clips of interviews with all involved provides a great flowing narrative and conveys the balls-out, hardcore punk, almost anarchic attitude it took to film "waldo" and subsequently the documentary. stuie and company deserve all the props in the world for not giving up when the going got tough and getting "a texas tale of treason" out so we can see what it's like for the budding filmmaker on the street!

i am sligthly biased because i appear in this film but i loved it and i am only in about seven dispersed minutes and am not nearly the most interesting part of it. the film is an honest and intriguing account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie. it is also an account of bloated expectations and fallen heros the interviews are well patched together in the editing. the different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person. also, the interviews are shot in a pretty interesting fashion keeping the film visually satisfying. definitely a worthwhile film. i hope it gets around.

i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased. when the show's run ended, i felt like too many questions remained unanswered. this movie to me felt like closure. to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding. i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect. if that is so, this is the appropriate way to go out. this movie is sometimes poignant, sometimes upsetting, but always satisfying. if you are or ever have been a fan of the show, watch this movie.

i enjoyed this film very much. i found it to be very entertaining for me in that i feel that it captured the romanticism of turn of the century irish-american culture. there's no messages. there's no violence and there's no overt sex, just wholesome 1947 style entertainment and dennis morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs. a really good movie.

this excellent musical movie, in beautiful technicolor, is so wonderful it's enough to make every person of irish descent feel proud. full of the joy and celebration of all things irish, a fine cast, with brilliant settings and superb theatrical trappings, lovely irish music and the superlative irish tenor voice of star dennis morgan, 'tis the luck o' the irish to have such a marvelous movie to enjoy over and over again! not just just for st. patty's day, mind you, but for all year round.one of the jewels produced by jack l. warner during his heyday as studio boss in burbank in the 1940s.shame on warner brothers for not having this fine picture available on home video and dvd!

back in 1983, michael jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $1 million horror music video with the "american werewolf" team and featuring the voice of vincent price, then that was exactly what he was going to do. and never has a music video created such a sensation, before or since ... when it was released on vhs, this 13-minute short became the world's largest selling musical of all time. but odds are you already know all about it, as whenever there's a list of the greatest music videos of all time, this one almost invariably takes the top spot.it begins with michael jackson walking down a dark street with his date after their car has broken down. he explains to her that he's "not like other men" (damn right), and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds. his girlfriend stands there and screams, and screams, and then screams some more, during a lavish transformation sequence as michael jackson becomes a werewolf. he chases her through the forest, catches her and we ... cut to a movie theatre. ah, all of this is just occurring in a horror movie that michael jackson and his date are watching.so, we're five minutes in and still no sign of the song "thriller". extravagant, much? anyway, you must know how it goes from here ... dancing, singing ... graveyard ... vincent price ... zombies ... "what's the problem?" ... then end credits. end credits for a friggin' music video. "thriller" isn't one of michael jackon's most memorable songs, but even by today's standards it sure is a bitch of a visual experience. if you still haven't seen it in it's entirety, then you definitely should someday soon.

the video opens with a scene from a horror movie, in which a man proposes to his girlfriend. he begins to tell her that he is "different." as the full moon rises, he morphs into a werewolf. he then pursues her through the woods, and right before he attacks, we're taken to the inside of the movie theater. inside the theater are michael and his girlfriend. she's too scared to watch any longer, so they leave. as they exit the theater, he begins to tease her. ("it's close to midnight, something evil's lurking in the dark...") michael then sings and dances his way down the street with his girlfriend. this scene shows michael's skill with the camera. he never once acts "aware" of its presence, as many other artists do. as they make there way past the graveyard, the graves begin to open... once they arrive at an alley, they are confronted with a horde of the undead. we then see the horror stricken face of michael's girl. who wouldn't have a horror stricken look if their date morphed into a zombie? yep, he becomes one of the undead. (a very bright and shiny one, though.) he and his fellow zombies then begin what may be the most well known dance choreography of any music video. to tell you any more would give the ending away.this is my favorite music video of all time! you don't want to miss it! i give it a 10/10. (yes, i know you can see the curtains in the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks kind of cheesy by today's standards.)

without a doubt, this is the big momma of all music videos!!! unlike most music videos that are either "dance videos" badly storied and/or badly interrupted lyrics this was done right. jackson was co-writer and by evidence of vh1 heavily choreographed and directed this masterpiece. in fact you could say thriller is creepier then most horror movies with that last second sparkling eye. to me this music video is what you judge all other music videos on. you can easily see the ominous influence m.j. had on early break-dancing with the zombie march number. because of the dancing, comedy, storyline, and yes horror. i give it a 5 of 5.

i have been a fan of amanda's since all that, and she is still funny. too me, it's as simple as that. if you like the bynes, you will like this film. it's harmless fun and quite funny in parts. vi's wacky sebastian accent and mannerisms are entirely unrealistic but made me laugh so hard at some points i almost choked on my popcorn. and anything that gets teens reading shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. on a shallow note, tatum channing is quite *ahem* freaking hot. he also does a good job with some of the film's tougher scenes. some of the side characters are very broad, but they are broad in "twelfth night" so it's cool.

when i went to see this movie i thought that this would just be another chic flick i would have to endure with my sister. plus too amanda baynes last movie was not so hot, making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress.however within 5mins i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "out there" that it took more then a second to understand it but very funny. the script was not too complex that i could not understand the love triangle but was very true to the original play by shakepeare. i loved every minute of it so much that i kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol!!! very embarrassing! i'd definitely advise people to see this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot!!(lol) so much so that i might just get it on dvd.

shes the man is great. its funny, original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat. the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods (man trouble)but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face. the story is a bit out there with the whole no-one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable, the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history. amanda b. did a great job as the main role and channing tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous duke. so girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls! all in all a brilliant,fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on dvd when it comes out.

i caught this movie right in my eye when i was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. the tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, i thought of the possibility of it being similar to national lampoon's dorm daze. i liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, i decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.delightfully, i came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. amanda bynes definitely kicked it off better than keira knightley in bend it like beckham. being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. this movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. the only way of pulling it off is through this movie.the principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. i'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. it is a definite guarantee.

i think a person would be well-advised to read or see (i favour reading) "twelfth night" before seeing, or re-seeing "she's the man". the movie is good on its' own, but comparing the two, and looking for the in-jokes makes it a lot more fun. shakespeare was inspired by others. i think he'd give a thumbs-up.harld bloom said in "shakespeare, the invention of the human", that most of the people in "twelfth night" need to be locked up. malvolio, the person malcolm is based on, is-for no good reason. people in "she's the man" are sane in contrast. for instance, duke orsino is far more leval than the duke of orsino. he also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. he displays a lot of self-control.it's a teen comedy (a clean one), so it doesn't have the dark edges of the play. for instance olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother. in the movie, she has been dumped.if you like sir andrew and sir toby in the play, they don't have the same attention in the movie.the in-jokes are quite often quick. the hairdresser pauls' last name is given once. it is antonio. lots of people who've read the play say that antonio has more love for a man than is just friendship. deep love between men was noted in those days. some see a sexual side to it-homosexuality was illegal.the only line from the play i caught is where duke orsino quotes the coach on greatness during the soccar game. in the play, it is said by malvolio, quoting maria).

this movie is about viola (amanda bynes) and her quest to beat her school cornwell boys team after they kicked the girls team out. so she goes to the rival school illaria and joins the boys team, in doing so she falls for duke (channing tatum) who thinks shes a guy and likes olivia (laura ramsey) who likes viola as a her brother. i was in a version of the 12th night play and the beginning was very modern. so i knew the play well. i was very exited about seeing this movie and when i saw it it exceeded my expectations. it kept a lot of my favorite lines and i could see big connections to the play. though it was like the play it was not as complicated. it was also more of a chick flick than i expected but it was good. it was very funny. it pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies. you saw how viola (amanda bynes) thought wrongly about what guys thought and her complications in living in a guys world. you also see her room-mate, duke's(channing tatum), impression of this. i really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way. it also tells the modern theme "follow your dreams" but this time it has a twist. i think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved soccer and stuck up for herself and her family and her dreams. i think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars.

ok, now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy, which held back on the comedy but this wasn't. i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda bynes staring in it! she was amazing, really funny & is still stunning! the boys in it were also extremely fit, one major reason for going girls! the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play 'twelfth night', as it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the malvolio like character. the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty. the football skills in it were also amazing, it even made me think of playing football myself! anyway, to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance, which gets very confusing! go and see it!

at first, i honestly thought it would be a corny movie. but after seeing this, i was quite surprised. amanda bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast (especially that character played by "bullet tooth tony" from snatch. what a contrasting role between those two movies!). now, i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not, but her act, especially, was thoroughly enjoyable. even though the plot devolved into a teeny-bopper love triangle (though very funny) half-way into the movie, i feel that this shouldn't discount, what i think, the movie really is: simply entertaining. so if you happen to stumble upon it, whether by dvd or theater, i'm confident that you'll enjoy.

i have to be honest, i really had a good time watching she's the man. despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that i think anyone could get. adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie.amanda bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. of course, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother. she also has a girl who is chasing after her. well, the tag line says it all.this is a fun little teen drama that i think will be remembered for a while. amanda bynes did prove something in the film, it's really hard to really act like a guy. :d well, it's true! 8/10

this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. the strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of shakespeare. as joseph papp discovered back in the 1950s in central park, shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. and, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as twelfth night and a midsummer night's eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film. all the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham, another charming coming of age movie.

this movie is a great movie, however it is, as most movie highly predictable. the greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character amanda bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. she is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the most strangest and gut-busting faces ever made. it's good for the kids, and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. all in all, they did a good job updating an old classic, and deserves to rest on the movie stand along with o and 10 things i hate about you. the other actors also do a swell job, in many of their first time debuts.

i saw this film at a special screening. at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda bynes movie, but i was wrong. the movie is based on the shakespeares book "the twelth night" this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer. well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school. on her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love, lies, and deception. this movie is this years mean girls. i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie.

i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. i already knew it was going to be a funny movie, but it was funnier than i expected. sure there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me up. i thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were good in acting out this comedy. i have to give kudos to amanda bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy. as for the other actors, they were funny as well. of course there were moments where you yell at the screen "how can you not tell?", but that's all part of the fun. in the end the plot turned out pretty well. there's a happy ending, but what'd you expect. overall,just hilarious.

she's the man was everything i wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. i love the teen type "chick flick" films and i knew this one would be great!! in the same vein as 10 things i hate about you (one of my all time faves) she's the man is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines, and physical comedy i have seen in a long time. it's probably the funniest movie i've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious pink panther.) but she's the man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script, "three's company" style story of mistaken identities, and mixed messages, and the cast.amanda bynes is a star!! even since the days of the horribly campy (yet strangely entertaining "the amanda show", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. she's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. her style of physical comedy, impersonations, and witty dialect makes her hilarious. previously her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well made "what a girl wants." if that wasn't her break out vehicle than she's the man takes care of that hands down. bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. it's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next "it" girl. she is the all american, cute, down to earth, bubbly teen (although she's twenty now) and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen. but for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! she actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable. not entirely...but believable enough. most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious, non stop laughs. channing tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's "havoc" by plays duke. he's the jock, the captain of the soccer team, and eventually bynes' object of affection, unfortunately he's also sebastian's room mate (who is bynes.) he's a good leading man, and the chemistry is perfect between them. laura ramsey is olivia, who happens to be attracted to sebastian (who again is bynes.) she does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another. james kirk is great in his small role as the real sebastian. his resemblance to amanda bynes is astonishing...they are absolutely believable as twins and further more, from a distance you could understand someone believing bynes is sebastian. the rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between bynes and tatum but everyone is more or less supporting bynes terrific performance. she easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while.this is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore. the parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film. relative newcomer director andy fickman does such an incredible job on this film. he weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together. the story which is loosely based off of shakespeares twelfth night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film. it's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think. there isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film. nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down!!! 9/10

i got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in brea and i have been crazy for it ever since. the film is based on shakespeare's twelfth night which i have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so i certainly liked the references. but whether you like shakespeare or not it won't matter - the movie stands on it's on. it is super funny, witty and charming. amanda bynes is hilarious and so was david cross. actually the whole cast is great - i just happen to be a huge david cross fanatic. the cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few i hadn't heard before but i know they have a cd coming out so i will definitely buy it. everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!

i saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.i saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on shakespeare's twelfth night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on shakespearean grounds. i really think this is going way overboard: the only connections i could see with twelfth night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including viola & duke).aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. and that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to shakespeare.the movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. and that's really the best part imho: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that i'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.amanda bynes really is just delightful as viola / sebastian; channing tatum makes a wonderful duke; david cross does a wonderfully over the top principal gold. all of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. cinematography was excellent.wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!

i just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and i can't remember a movie where i laughed so hard -- literal out loud, deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end. the actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. the actors were perfectly cast. my children mentioned that amanda bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives. she is so refreshing. my children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. our money was well spent on this movie.

five years after she teamed up with james cagney in "the public enemy", mae clarke makes another appearance, this time as his fianc√©e with cagney's character on the other side of the law. it seems like she was calling more of the shots in their relationship as well, trying to get johnny cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career. you had to figure they'd get back together after she gave him the boot for challenging her crooked boss; those things have a way of working out in pictures.i got a kick out of watching cagney in this one. i usually do, and here he looked like he might have auditioned that characteristic shoulder shrug move that he used to good effect in "angels with dirty faces" portraying rocky sullivan. it was right after he threw cavanaugh (robert gleckler) out of his office during the first attempt at bribing the new weights and measures boss. he turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook - very cool.it's my understanding that this wasn't one of cagney's warner films, but it might as well have been. warner's often took up the cause for the common man, and the expose of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been right up their alley. you also have those great new york city street scenes depicting cars and shops of the era, with home made signs pricing flour at eighteen cents a pound. hey, how about the furniture store selling the living room set for a hundred eighty nine dollars, you might get a single stick chair for that price today.best part of the picture just might be that meat counter scene when cagney, james burke (aloysius) and the butchers play catch with an underweight chicken. one of the film's lighter moments, but you get an idea how tense people can get when they're caught cheating. same with the truck driver who's pressured by johnny into signing for an accurate delivery; he just wasn't used to doing that.all in all, a nice diversion from cagney's more typical gangster presence, even if not up to the standard of his feature films. it's easy enough to obtain as one of a handful of public domain cagney pictures out there, and often found in relatively inexpensive compilations.

this is the first james cagney film i have ever really watched. i was never interested in his movies before because i figured i wouldn't like anything in that style of cinema and because i've heard most cagney films are the same. i have to say i really liked it. by today's standards for movies, it was not special, but i found it surprisingly entertaining. cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well.

it's fun to watch a young james cagney doing his thing. he plays the cheapskate weights and measures guy who takes his job very seriously, stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians. he is offered the world, but keeps his integrity. he is beaten and set up, but that's the problem. we never know if he is really in danger. they say he's in a spot, but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do. at times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself. his allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt. he perseveres (almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. the problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense. it would have been much better if he had had to clear his name. he never drops into the depths, even when rejected by his wife to be. it's still fun with the bad guys kind of imploding. see it just to watch cagney do his tough guy posturing.

this is what james cagney is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma.although the plot sounds serious, the film is anything but. it is done in the 30's screwball comedy style and works well with his 'bickering' with fianc√© mae clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague james burke.what raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. dialogue is good but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can bounce about the characters involved. this is done well by all throughout.good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable.

early in the movie, cagney's johnny cave character tells his gumshoes in the office of weights and measures that in the previous year, unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the american consumer out of more money than the aggregate national war debt! then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short-selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off (oh, the horrors!!) and one skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs., after which the fur--or in this case feathers--flies. er, fly. when a racketeer in politician's clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyor's practices, our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across america. after all, four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy! word of his intransigence soon reaches both the mayor and the governor's offices, and cagney becomes a marked man. if it sounds silly, it's not--the dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool (or as hitchcock would say, the mcguffin) and while unfamiliar, it works every bit as well here as any treasury agent or g-man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country's common good. the production standards are decidedly grade-b, but it is cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is: this was his first film away from warner brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract, and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously--the performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma. mae clarke's presence lends a definite warner's feel to the overall production. the supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the story--but sit back and enjoy it for the cagney showcase and engaging depression-era time capsule that it is.

if you like cagney you'll like this film. it has the pretense of american integrity at any cost, personal or social. cagney plays the head of weights and measures in nyc. cagney goes up against crooked politicians, the criminal underground, a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. the chicken scene is hilarious where cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. the chicken gets tossed around the shop in a hilarious scene about who controls the "evidence". if you like old telephones there are interesting scenes of dials, phones and even bizarre phone cords. compared to a lot of film made today this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all should be the guiding principle of humanity. made in simpler times it reflects a world we can't find today. the fashion (especially hats) outwear and automobiles all play a prominent visual role in defining this little film.

the first time i've seen this dvd, i was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything, but also because the dvd itself is extremely loud. jimmy page obviously can't live with quiet music, i guess. i do must say though that during the concert at royal albert hall, they expanded 'how many more times' and 'moby dick' too long. other than that, it was exquisit. my favorite song of all time is now on that dvd. trampled underfoot. it's either that one or 'in my time of dying'. in that song, jimmy really plays that thing good. ever seen randy rhoads play? well, jimmy plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.

after waiting years for a definitive collection of led zeppelin perfomances on video, fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the greatest concert video ever! much better than the dismal "song remains the same", this video includes performances from no less than 5 different venues spanning a decade. it also includes rare interviews and tv appearances. the sound quality is amazing, considering the source material used. and the video quality is even more impressive. this is an absolute must for any led zeppelin fan.

i'll admit that i've never seen "waiting for guffman", 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant. when the advertising for best in show had the tagline "from the team that brought you waiting for guffman", a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. for shame, critics, for shame times two! any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that i hope people will experience, now that its video/dvd. "best in show" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000.the film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual mayflower "best in show" competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. we have the loveable and gullable harry pepper (guest) with his bloodhound, the simple gerry & cookie fleck (levy & o'hara) with their terriors, nut-case yuppies hamilton & meg swan (hitchcock & posey), the gay dog groomers scott dolan & stefan vanderhoof (higgins & mckean), and the airheaded millionare sheri ann ward cabot (coolidge) along with her trainer christy cummings (lynch). they all have their minds on one simple object: the blue ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. and...do i have to tell you the rest?director/writer/star guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of films like "american pie" or other pointless "teenage" flicks won't take over the world after all. his idea is simple: make your comedy not just funny, but smart funny. but instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like "zero effect" and "high fidelity", he used a rather unusual approach (and as i understand, he also used this approach for "guffman"). whether you notice or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. in other words, what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script, maybe even not even dreamed of by guest and co-writer/star levy. but with a gentle hand from guest, he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other, less adept actors. now that's smart!the cast is, of course, what makes improv work the most. all of them are a (comedic) marvel to behold, especially guest as pepper. but the real standout has to be fred williard as buck laughlin, the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is, if the announcer was trying to be funny. williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. there's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy: have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like "have a doggie-style of a time". its priceless, as is his performance.i hope that people engage in this 90-minute "dogumentary". the film deserves so much recognition. it did get nominated for best picture-comedy at the golden globes, but didn't win. i can't see why. i mean, in the comedy department, it is best in show.grade: a

how often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? waldo's last stand is a refreshment. here waldo is selling lemonade but isn't making any money. alfalfa, spanky, darla, mickey, and buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 men in a tub and came the brawn where there was competition between alfalfa and waldo for darla's affection. back to the story: the gang taste the lemonade to see if waldo made it right. one funny moment is when alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade and waldo fills is and gives it to darla and alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even mickey agrees ever so cute. when the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in (froggy). spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no. spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time froggy nods no spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny. spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. one way is when after mickey said ever so cutely "those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty". there is also many entertain musical bit is this short. the opening number is by darla which she tap dances and sings. the second includes alfalfa singing off-key (as usually) with mickey, leonard, spanky, and buckwheat about "how dry i am!" (i believe they sing that to make froggy thirsty. it also made me laugh.). the closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way. this was waldo's last our gang short. a grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10.

...the opportunity it gave me to look at ireland's past was invaluable.i had the benefit of seeing this with my mother who hailed from cork, and in watching, we talked and i learned a lot from her about how things were back then.stuff like how deasy and co. was a cork soft drinks company; how rain truly could destroy a harvest; how farmers used to have to collect the crop; how in dance halls the women and men did really have to stand along opposite walls before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance; about the bellows that kept the fire going; how priests really did call out the list of church donators and their donations and a bit about the currency back then (which my dad helped by showing me a case displaying the pence, shillings and crowns that were used back then (which were legal tender in england also)).i didn't pay that much attention to how good the movie was, but i was very grateful in having this opportunity to look back on a period of time that for some is irish history, but for others including some of our parents and grandparents, is just their childhood.

"five fingers of death" is a classic of 70's kung fu cinema. as the film that "broke out" hk cinema to the west, this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre. it's also a damn entertaining film, with hard-hitting, non-stop action, solid and mostly believable fight choreography and great over-the-top 70's era dubbing ("oh i see ... so you want it the hard way!! hwaa!!")."five fingers" is an eye-for-an-eye revenge tale ... and i mean literally, eye for an eye! it's great to see lo lieh portraying a hero. he played so many great villains later in his career - including pai mei in the classic fist of the white lotus, which was one of the characters tarantino used in creating the pai mei of kill bill.my only complaint is that i wish there was a better quality dvd - mine looks like it was a vhs transfer. overall this is a great film - don't miss it!bart blackstone film club - hollywood, ca

this was the very first kung fu movie that i have ever seen. the dubbing is not the greatest but alot better than some that i had seen. the plot is much better than some that are made today. it is gory at times but that is what gives it that special push. academy award material is it not. but if you like to watch fights and a decent story backround, this is for you!

ok...ths film (like segal's last few films) once again goes beyond the "knock 'em down, kick 'em in the groin, shoot 'em in the face, get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister's niece's cousin" stuff seagal was into for a while. geepers, steven started thinking, and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them. sure....there is plenty of action in this flick, but also some thought and heart. it's not an oscar flick, but well worth the effort, unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second. it's worth a rental..or two!!

this is another classic seagal movie. he walks, no, cruises through the patriot just all the other mega seagal movies. nothing even comes close to challenging seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out, i mean lets face it, its master seagal, he's got to win. what about his outfit in the film, masterpiece, he must have picked it himself. its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but seagal doesn't even get a cough. the incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass, genius, i bet seagal thought of that one as well. this film is class pure and simple. great plot, great characters, and seagal.

i think this is one hell of a movie...........we can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there's a message in it, without the message it would be one of many action/fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special.

in my personal opinion - ¬´the patriot¬ª is one of the best steven seagal movies.i've heard people say it's the worst one ever, it's not like ss etc. i disagree. as a highly spiritual person, a great master seagal established a good tradition in action movies. he always has a good background, great action, high professionalism and a clever message. this movie has it all. you have good shooting scenes, great aikido. although there isn't a lot of it, it shows us its peaceful side. this change in his film making only proves his spiritual growth (he doesn't kill chisolm's buddy in the end).¬´the patriot¬ª is definitely one of the best films from the ¬´filmmaker's¬ª point of view which i have seen lately. you have great panoramic shots of montana, we see real american nature and beautiful wildlife(among others - horses and flowers). the soundtrack also deserves a few words. during the film i had a great opportunity to listen to classical american-cowboy-western music(not country though). similar music was heard in ¬´back to the future prt.3¬ª. ss's acting has greatly improved since his last films. his role is unfamiliar to him(unlike cops & commandos), but he does a good job playing the-retired-doctor-from-the-government. his acting is convincing and his lines are good.i was really pleased with the cast. lq jones proves that life & death walk the earth together, whitney yellow robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist, camilla belle makes a great appearance as mcclaren's daughter.mr.seagal discusses the much debated ¬´real american¬ª tradition and the militia squads, providing his own point of view(he likes the constitution just fine, but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with it). also good points are raised regarding the eastern-western medicine system and nature.seagal's best. and opening new horizons in his film career.

good footage of world war i-era ships and planes supplement this excellent war drama set in the adriatic. walter huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. the safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. robert montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat. he makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a "real man" after he is court martialed and dismissed from the navy. robert young plays a lieutenant junior grade and jimmy durante as a cook. paralleling the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between montgomery and madge evans who plays huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator. recommended.

exciting, action-packed, and interesting film telling the tale of a group of men stationed at a naval base in italy and their adventures aboard a navy submarine during wwi. tommy and brick (played by robert montgomery and robert young) are two pals, and make for a couple of very handsome officers, i must say. a new captain arrives on-board, already known by a few as "dead pan" toler (walter huston) and he's a real stickler for following the rule book and a "code of honor". soon tommy and brick are chasing after an attractive blonde at an officer's dance, tommy insults the captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. but tommy wins out anyway as he and the daughter sneak away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon bond during an air raid - unfortunately for him, she reveals she is married. later tommy gets himself into some real trouble when he disobeys orders in an effort save his buddy.this film is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that held my interest and top-notch performances by all. a climactic death scene featuring sterling holloway is haunting indeed - the most memorable scene in this film, i thought. eugene palette and jimmy durante add some humor here playing a couple of goofballs - durante's character is actually studying to be a dentist via mail-order and continually has onshore run-ins with a british man who makes fun of his nose. okay - if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, this would be the one.

robert montgomery and robert young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in italy during world war i. the dialog is highly entertaining, and jimmy durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "ptomaine". walter huston's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine, a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman. one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes. i was surprised at how similar the technology of world war i was to the technology displayed 25 years later in world war ii. basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservativism i thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. all in all i felt that the cast, characters, action scenes, and view of history depicted in this movie were first-rate.

i recommend that movie viewers if in the new york city area go to the intrepid museum and get some idea of how closed in and cramped the living was for the crews of world war ii vintage submarines. how much more so that must have been for the seamen during world war i. it must have truly been hell below.walter huston and robert montgomery head the cast of hell below, huston as the by the book captain and montgomery as his free wheeling number two. they're both quite believable as naval officers and the rest of the cast like robert young, eugene palette, jimmy durante, madge evans, sterling holloway, etc. fill their roles quite nicely.the silent service got more popular during world war ii and after. it's amazing, but i could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like torpedo run, operation pacific, hellcats of the navy, run silent, run deep and many more and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them. i guess there truly is a limit on situations as well.jimmy durante's performance is interesting. he's pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is very funny indeed. but i'd have to say a character like him in those cramped quarters is probably very necessary for morale. if you don't have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine, you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediately.the highlight for me however is sterling holloway's death scene. very similar to sean mcclory's in island in the sky. it will haunt you long after you've seen this film.

as i type these comments i'm watching a dvd of this movie that i just got from a mail-order dealer, and i'm finding that it holds up extremely well, with strong characterizations, believable situations, and well-staged action scenes.it's been a good 45 years, maybe 50, since i saw hell below, but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was sterling holloway's death scene, which several other commenters have mentioned here. i haven't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing, but i can vouch for what other comments have said: once you see sterling holloway's death scene in this movie, you will absolutely never, ever forget it. judging from how strong the film so far is holding up, i fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it -- as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history. the movie's worth seeing for that moment alone, but even without it, it would be a first-rate early submarine drama.

the crew of an american submarine discover it's hell below while fighting in the adriatic in 1918.although nearly forgotten, this excellent war film still delivers solid entertainment, thanks to a literate script, superior performances and highly believable action scenes.robert montgomery & walter huston play submarine officers under the stress of war who quickly are at odds with each other, with dramatic and tragic results. since montgomery is in love with huston's daughter, madge evans in a well-played role, the situation becomes even more complicated, both on shore and beneath the waves. the viewer is torn between the two strong characters, one of whom is governed by his heart and the other by the rules.robert young makes an effective appearance as montgomery's buddy. sterling holloway creates a brief, vivid, portrait of a doomed seaman.eugene pallette as the torpedo master & jimmy durante as the sub's cook make for a very funny comedy team and provide the story with plenty of laughs. durante's nose comes in for lots of ribbing and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with british tars.movie mavens will recognize babe london as an obese italian miss; maude eburne as the wife of a british admiral & paul porcasi as an italian admiral - all uncredited.mgm has given the film absolutely first-class production values, with the undersea sequences especially well produced. both the claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately portrayed. other moments of unexpected drama (montgomery & miss evans caught on top of a stalled ferris wheel during an air raid) and hilarity (durante boxing a kangaroo) are expertly threaded into the fabric of the movie to provide a totally satisfying viewing experience.

you can tell that this is the first offering by the director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential this guy has. this is an obviously low budget film in the spirit of boondock saints. of course, boondock saints came out a few years after this, so you could look at this as a diamond in need of some polish. the acting was good - if you're looking for deniro or michael madsen in a crime drama, remember that these are young guys, playing young guys trying to be criminals. they're not going to be "supercool" (tm) like some of the veterans. i would have love to have seen justin pagel (joe - the main character) go on to make more movies - he was great in this. good movie - 3 stars out of 5.

i felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that i rented from blockbuster. this movie has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism".this movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor! i will definitely watch it again! there were some funny parts as well as action-packed drama. i enjoy movies that keep you wondering what's going to happen next.the writer/director, travis milloy, should make more movies!!! in my overall opinion, this movie was great! i'm looking forward to his next one! travis milloy has real talent as a writer and director.

i don't have a really solid thesis here, so i'm just going to toss out some observations.first of all, the film is absolutely gorgeous. it's shot in high contrast black and white, and some of the scenes are so well composed that they're almost distracting.there's a sequence early on of some intense protests, and some of the shots were amazing -- three guys launching tear gas at the protesters, etc.second of all, i think that one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film looking back on the 60's is that it's really about how the idealism of the revolution morphed and shifted into something different. the take on this shift is really interesting -- i think that both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more self-indulgent phase have strong points and weak points. the film doesn't necessarily take the position that things decayed.third, i think the romance works very well.finally, i really, really, really hated the ending. it was way too melodramatic. you could even say that the ending is unworthy of the film that preceded it.

it's not like an historical movie, it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories, it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario, but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere...it had that 60's kind of bohemian and rebellious spirit: a group of friends living in a poor apartment in paris, each one making art, dreaming of changing the world, doing drugs and loving in his very own way.it takes a lot of patience to watch, and a special mood, that if you're not in, you might find it extremely boring and dull.i liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on student's lives: the fear for their future, the difficulty of earning their living, the obstacles in following their dreams.what i absolutely loved was the black & white image. the still camera angles were amazing, they were like freezing moments. it left me the impression of a long slide show of old and very emotive and suggestive photographs. i actually had to see the movie again, just to take those amazing screen-shots.in one word: beautiful...

this is a very long movie, indeed. but it is quite beautiful, and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. a story easily told cannot be expected in les amants r√©guliers, but every scene, every silence here tells much more than a hundred dialogs. touching, different, perfect in its pictures and soundtrack, showing why the close brought by the cinema as one of its main features became the greatest innovation in any dramatic representation. someone who is used to that kind of movies where everything is told, and action takes place all the time, will find this tiring. but it is worth watching, to find out other possibilities of feeling a story.

seeing les amants reguliers calls immediately for comparison with bertolucci's movie 'the dreamers', in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in paris. actually director philippe garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague, sharing the principal actor and even including a direct replica eye-in-viewer-eye about an older film of bertolucci. and yet, lar is a different film, and an interesting one.the story line seems also familiar. the movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 'emeutes', maybe among the best done until now. the film is made in black-and-white, and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds eisenstein. then, as in the dreamers, the action moves in the parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream, and fall for one other. there is no direct social comment, no real explanation of the background of the revolt. the movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters. it's like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through, it's just that not all the participants may adapt or survive.the film is more about the characters than about the events. and it is merely for the style it will be remembered about. the black-and-white cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes, but also when looking at the characters evolution. many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies, with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune. the effect is exquisite. yet the length of the film is hardly justified, it lasts more than three hours and i doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss - actually i am convinced it's quite a contrary.without raising at the depth and subtlety of bertolucci's movie lar is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of france and of the world in the 20th century.

the reason i am reviewing this is that the previous review, was written by someone who walked out of this film, not even half way through. unfortunately for him, he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty. agreed the film was very slow to start, in fact the friend i was with fell asleep briefly,i woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s. fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel. be patient, like many great films its well worth the wait, and is certainly a film that i will look forward to revisiting! 8/10

this is the best french movie of the year ! i saw it twice and i found it great both times. i didn't think it boring at all even though it is very long (3 hours). i'm seventeen so i obviously didn't get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history, but it doesn't really matter since i still really enjoyed the film. it's actually quite universal : people of my parents' age can identify to the characters and so can people my age. garrel seems to perfectly understand young people, the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world. maybe that's because the character played by louis garrel (his son)is actually meant to represent philippe garrel himself. well anyway, great movie, no action (have to be honest on that point) but so strong feelings that you can't possibly stay indifferent to it. if you're looking for a relaxing sunday-evening movie, don't waste your time on this, you'll be disappointed. but if you like cinema, you'll like les amants r√©guliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50's and 60's by the nouvelle vague artists.

this film is probably the best new french film i've seen in this century so far. there have been some great ones including noe's irreversible, green's le pont des arts and hadzihalilovic's innocencebut none of them come close to les amants reguliers' timeless glory.the movie is a description of the events of may 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of, and a homage to, the nouvelle vague-movies of those days. concerning the depiction of the riots in paris the movie is meticulously accurate (i'm only 19 and i wasn't there myself but you know what i mean)and the almost real-time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris. the riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in bertolucci's the dreamers (to which the movie is comparable in many ways) instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william lubtchansky. the love story that is the movie's main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment.this film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60's which makes the film all the more compelling. but the film is also a homage to the whole nouvelle vague canon. much of the dialogue evokes early truffaut, and the length and non-action and plot less structure is reminiscent of eustache or rivette. there are even godard-like verfremdung-effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing bernardo bertolucci directly. this film is no doubt an answer song to bertolucci's the dreamers and it is also a nouvelle vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love story.bottom line: this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldn't sleep on it. it may be the finest french film since eustache's la mamain et la putain.

philippe garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the nouvelle vague, almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor but ready to rise again from its ashes if recalled from the past. they who are a little acquainted with the director's subjects, on the other hand, may know very well how he's obsessed by a lingering sense of loss as far as fickleness of reality is concerned. "les amants r√©guliers", therefore, show us the parallel stories of an "amour fou" and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young french students.the first part of the story is about the dramatic events of may '68 in france evoked in a series of astonishing plan-sequences, a sort of cinema verit√© style, that place the student insurrection in anything but an enviable light against a pitch-black background.there's much that can be said about the peculiarities of black-and-white photography used to describe the battle between students and police, where the high contrasts confer an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and darkness closes in upon the excited bodies wrapping them in mystery. the images, completely deprived of words, show the real consistence of the myth, made of crude violence, more and more emphasized by the exasperated reality of the movie shootings. the individual doesn't count anything at all here: he tends to disappear in the mass. what really matters in these fight scenes are the significance of the mass-suggestion, the blind fury of the juvenile assault, sinister eulogies of the power of the mob, even if conceived like separate entities apart from any kind of emotion, with the cold and distant look of an entomologist intent to catalog his insect collection.the second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way. stands out on the horizon the distressing portrait of a self-centered generation in search of its lost time, completely disenchanted about the individual values of men, inclined to rotate on its own axis between opium fumes and making a funeral oration in the praise of its recent defeat."les amants r√©guliers" seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great robert bresson, revised and corrected by garrel's particular sensibility without drifting away from the main argument, trying to expand overall perspectives on the subject of human disillusions that though painful may bring us to the truth. in my opinion, trying to penetrate deeply into the substrate of the story, if a man lets himself go and play things by ear, he probably will find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with dire and irretrievable consequences.

this is a great movie, a must own. i really liked every aspect of it, from the sword fighting, the romance, the costumes were really well done and put together. the scenery is absolutely beautiful. i also loved the mystery and magic. also the message of the power of love, that love is the greatest power there is. i really like the heart of the king in the sense that he desires peace instead of the bloodshed and hate. i wish that i could live in a world like that with flying ships, to castles in the sky. i also think that it was really nice how they brought the animals into the movie. i also thought that the cook was really funny. i have watched it many times in one day and still never tire of it. just wish they would bring it onto a dvd.

this a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart. i got lost in this sweet film watching it at the mann's chinese theatre in hollywood. it's truly romantic with a touching message.the artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so apparent. the frames are like watching moving art. it also has a strong and talented cast of actors. what a wonderful surprise to see joss ackland, he is just a fairy-tale perfect king. sarah douglas is terrific as the villain and christine taylor and tom schultz make a lovely romantic pair. the fact that the movie was made on a ridiculously tiny indie film budget just blows me away. it may not be the slick hollywood stuff we're inundated by but it's a really nice movie to rent and enjoy curled up on your sofa on a rainy saturday. don't forget the microwave popcorn. that's my advice. just enjoy it.

i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say.. it was simply awesome. for those of you whom loves 'the never ending story' this is one that would bring back memories of that movie. even though it is a 1996 movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is, a fantasy. the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song. to those of you who have yet to see it, watch it! i recommended completely!

satisfying fantasy with ships sailing thru clouds with cannons, evil plotters, strange landscapes, manipulations of time, great sets, void of reality, maybe like never ending story or some merlin stuff. if you like that, you'll love it. christine taylor is beautiful. sword fighting is phoney. music is delightful. good wins out, they kiss, all is well, and the cook is pleased.

it is movie about love,violence,illegal affairs and romanian tycoons. a romanian story combined with an occidental adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern european audiences that have long forgotten about the conservative comunist regim over film-making.a film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tensed situations as the movie goes on . a story that impresses because of its view over the hard life from the neighbourhood. two young men do illegal car races. they work together as a team and prosper from their occupation ,but when they are asked by a local tycoon to lose one race things start to get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up creating a very tensionated movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that.brilliant acting both by dragos bucur and dorina chiriac along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director radu muntean also give a unique charm to furia. all this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the filmlovers around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race ,language we speak or country. it is a real hope for the romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced occidental cinema.i hope you enjoy watching it as i'm sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it.

this is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding romanian cinema. i do recommend it being an intense drama with no lack of action and thrills. the movie concentrates upon teen life in the bucharest suburbs trough the main character, not focusing so much on the character's shape or definition but more on the anger that he and other characters feel. the title "furia" means rage rather than anger, but could be regarded in the movie in both senses from the behavior of actors. the rather odd love story (not a typical romantic one, but rather a modern suburban conception) is well shaped towards the end. it is a captivating picture, and cinematography is pretty good in catching the suburban night life thus making it a nice movie to watch and.you won't get bored for a minute, i promise!

this movie is pretty good as it is, but the unreleased producer's cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. jamie's story is handled differently, the death scenes are done 10 times better, there's more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about micheal, jamie and her baby. there is also an alternate ending which is also better. why they didn't release this version instead i have no damned clue. if you can find this version, see it.

for some reason, i always enjoy movies that people hate, when i really don't think they're that bad - and this is one of those films. in the case of this movie, i think it is way too over-criticized, i really isn't that bad of a film at all. in fact, i think this is one of the better sequels. "halloween: the curse of michael myers" begins on the night before halloween, where michael brutally murders jamie lloyd (who was taken captive by the "man in black" in part 5) after she gives birth to his baby. we are then introduced to the strode family, who is now coincidentally living in the old myers house (which seems to change in each film). kara and her son danny are the main characters, along with tommy doyle, the now adult boy who survived the original killings. they must fight together to save jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of michael, while michael himself is driven to kill by an old celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in haddonfield.this is surely one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and i can't understand all of the hate it has gotten. it had some nice suspense, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, i'll admit), some scary moments here and there, and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds. not all of the acting wasn't particularly great, but it was convincing enough for me. marianne hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable. paul rudd plays a grown-up tommy doyle, and is also very talented and plays his part nicely. the rest of the supporting cast (besides the brilliant donald pleasance) isn't much to praise, but it wasn't too bad either, all things considered. i'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why michael kills was completely necessary, but it turned out to be okay in the end and i wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together. the open-ended conclusion was also kind of eerie, but could have been something more. i have also seen the infamous "producer's cut" of this film, the original cut of it, and i think that in some respects, it is better. it further explains the thorn curse that drives michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film, plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion. it felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film. i wish that dimension would release this alternate version of the film, because i personally think it is better. the chances of that are very slim though.overall, "halloween: the curse of michael myers" is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series. this movie isn't the best of all horror movies, but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see michael do his thing. just don't expect brilliance, and you'll enjoy it. 7/10.

wow, "the curse of michael myers" what a great film. suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a clever plot which i love. many hate the 'thorn' concept, i love it. i think that it gives the halloween series some plot. marianne hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance, especially for her first film and paul rudd and donald pleasence are great also. my only complaint is that why wasn't danielle harris in this film as jamie? she wanted to return, but the producers said no. i thought j.c brandy was great, but i love danielle harris. still, i love halloween: the curse of michael myers. i think the shape's mask looks the best in this film and george p. wilbur is the best michael myers ever. incredibly creepy and suspenseful, halloween 6 rules! i adore this very violent, but immensely enjoyable film. the halloween horror series - by far the best in the genre.10 out of 10.

this was a really interesting halloween film. i wasnt to thrilled with the whole thorn theory but it still makes for a good film. i liked getting to see tommy doyle back but sadly donald pleasance died right after shooting. the film had a really really bad director who didnt give a flip about the series, from what i heard treated donald bad, and wouldnt let danielle harris come back as jamie. its like he was just trying to bring down the film, but i still liked it. there were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the producers cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. with those scenes it turns into a whole new movie. check it out if you have the chance.

halloween 666 (1995) the producer's cut review!halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to part five. if you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. a mysterious "man in black" has raided the haddonfield police department freeing micheal myers. in the process poor jamie lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. what they want with her? who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. doctor loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop michael myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). a friend of loomis, doctor wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. another old face from part one guest stars as well.this dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. for some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time. so they decide to dumb it down. then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. no matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. they should have left well enough alone. hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don't they?producer's cut :highly recommended released version: not recommended

this video has heartfelt memories. it has a great cast and all the actors did a great job. i have been searching to buy this video. if anybody knows of where i can purchase, please e-mail me. i really want to add this to my collection.

to understand "crash course" in the right context, you must understand the 80's in tv. most tv shows didn't have any point. the sitcom outpopulated the drama at least 3 to 1. they were still figuring out where the lines were so that they could cross them. (tv shows like "hail to the chief" was quite the bold step!) this made-for-tv movie "crash course" featured an all-star cast, bringing together members from all the 80's classics: "227", "family ties", "who's the boss?", et al. directors must've had a certain penchant for those all-star movies then. still, this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity. and that's not bad sometimes. viva soleil moon frye.

i loved this movie when i was younger, and i have actually been looking for it again!! i would love to watch it again!! the information is all correct, but the cover doesn't look like it would match - i can't say for sure though. from what i remember, the movie was about these kids (alyssa milano, tina yothers, etc.) in a driving class, and it also shows the mischief they get into outside the class. edie mcclurg was alyssa milano's mother in the movie. i remember i really liked it so if anyone knows where i can get a copy (preferably dvd) of the movie listed above (with those stars in it) i would love to know. thank-you :)

i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful elgin theatre. i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least, the bravura performance of al pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy irons.the film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty, law vs justice, and passion vs reason. some might protest that the content is inherently anti-semitic, however they should consider the historical context of the story, and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation.9/10

the inherent problem with any staging of 'the merchant of venice' has never been the pseudo-controversial anti-semitism, but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content; a frothy romantic comedy and a searing tragedy. while mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century (and mocked by shakespeare in hamlet), it rarely fails to grate with modern audiences. as a result, most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other, and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of shylock.like so many of shakespeare's great tragic heroes, shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. pitiful, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be argued over. he is flawed not because he is a jew, but because he is human. rarely do modern screenwriters imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions, and it is to everyone's benefit that we have shakespeare to draw on for inspiration.shakespearean language is wild and rambling, saturated in multiple meanings, word play and metaphor. to be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. when an actor fails, the words pour forth in a torrent of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the english language springs to life with an immediacy and vibrancy that takes your breath away. al pacino is one such actor, and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that, were there any justice, would sweep every award in the offering. he meets the challenge of presenting shylock head on, and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. it would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with king lear.the supporting cast is noteworthy. jeremy irons gives an original take on the familiar antonio, presenting an older, quieter figure that displays the unsavoury contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudice of the time. joseph fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond superficial eye-candy to actually inhabit a character for once. lynn collins is the only disappointment. many of shakespeare's women are underwritten and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life, and collins' gwyneth paltrow impersonation seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that radford is aiming for.the design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of late renaissance venice. the city has not looked this ominous since 'don't look now'. taking full advantage of extant locations and natural light, the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design. all, again, are worthy of award recognition.the financial backers of films such as this must be commended. with a budget of $30 million, they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit, and yet they invest nonetheless. we can all be grateful for it, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a benchmark for many years to come.

michael radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen. he has taken a play with a reputation for anti-semitism, and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews. radford said after the screening, and i agree, that shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a driving, compulsive need for revenge. he also points out, quite rightly, that a man who was anti-semitic could not have written shylock's speech of "if you prick me, do i not bleed?" radford is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from flaws; no character is evil. radford has placed the play in the 16th century, which gives a lush background of venetian politics and decadence on which to project shakespeare's words.if you get a chance to hear radford speak about the film, i highly recommend you take it, since he gives details about life in 16th century venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing. i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary.jeremy irons does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio, a man who resigns himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds. lynn collins, a relative unknown, gives us an absolutely flawless, stunning, and detailed job as portia. not only is ms. collins beautiful - she also gives portia layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a terrific job, with a notable performance by kris marshall as gratiano, and a beautifully subtle work by allan corduner as tubal, playing the foil to shylock. finally, while al pacino pulls out his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words, but you can see all the emotions and madnesses flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing.if you like period movies, i cannot recommend this movie enough.

'the merchant of venice' is one of shakespeare's better-known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. incredibly, however, this film would seem to be the first-ever english-language version made for the cinema rather than television. there were a number of versions made in britain or america during the early days of the cinema, but these were all silents.the reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged anti-semitism, a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the nazis in 1933. (this may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era; in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today). yet in my view the film is not anti-semitic at all. it should be remembered that during shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled jewish community in england; the jews had been expelled by edward i in the late 13th century, and were not permitted to return until the time of cromwell, some forty years after shakespeare's death. as far as we know, shakespeare never travelled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-semitism at first hand. the play is not simply about the jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. it may, in fact, be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between catholics and protestants in tudor england (something of which shakespeare certainly would have had first-hand experience) and an appeal for greater tolerance between them.then as now, traditional anti-semitic stereotypes had always depicted jews as avaricious, but shylock's principal sin is not avarice; if it were, he would certainly have accepted bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount borrowed by antonio. rather, shylock's besetting sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow-jews are treated by the christians of venice. not only are jews in general regarded as second-class citizens, but jewish moneylenders such as shylock are particular targets for abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary to the venetian economy. the play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. not only do views of this sort corrupt the christians who hold them, they can also corrupt the jews who suffer abuse. shylock's vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered. by spitting on him and calling him a dog, antonio behaves like a boorish bigot, but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty. moreover, shylock seeks to revenge himself on antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that antonio has done towards him, but also for all the wrongs, real and imaginary, that he has suffered at the hands of the christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to lorenzo. it is to the credit of the film's director, michael radford and of its star, al pacino, that they understand all these issues. pacino's shylock has, initially, a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally, after his humiliation in the trial scene by portia's reasoning, to pathos. we see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathise with him. in my view, none of pacino's performances that i have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'godfather' films (not 'scent of a woman', for which he won an oscar, and certainly not 'godfather iii'), but 'the merchant of venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks. the other acting performance that stood out was lynn collins's luminous portia, speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. i was less impressed with jeremy irons's antonio, who seemed too passive. antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, part melancholy contemplative, part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. although irons captured the first two of those aspects, it was difficult to envisage his antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures. radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the 'daily telegraph' who, although he admired pacino's performance, disliked the period setting and argued that shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have 'relevance' for a modern audience, citing a recent stage production which set the action in weimar germany. i would disagree profoundly with this approach. the theatre and the cinema are quite different media and, while there have been some striking modernist approaches to shakespeare in the cinema (trevor nunn's 'twelfth night' comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best one. (i preferred, for example, zeffirelli's 'romeo and juliet' to baz luhrmann's). the idea that we can only appreciate shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the elizabethan society that produced him, but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentieth-century man.radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are age-old, universal problems, but also makes for a visually striking film. in the play, the scenes set in venice itself are characterised by turbulent action; those set in portia's country house at belmont are happier and more peaceful. in the film, the venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty, wintry grey skies, similar to the look achieved in 'don't look now'. the candlelit interiors, with faces brightly lit against a dark background, were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a caravaggio painting; i suspect this was quite deliberate, as caravaggio was a contemporary of shakespeare. by contrast to dark or misty venice, the belmont scenes (shot in an enchanting palladian villa on an island in a lake) were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. this is one of the best shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play. 8/10.a couple of errors. we see a black swan on the water in front of portia's house. these birds are natives of australia and were not introduced to europe until well after 1596, the date when the film is set. also, the portrait of portia in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the florentine botticelli, who was active about a century before that date. lynn collins may be reminiscent of a botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a late 16th century venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late 15th century florence.

this movie has a decent story in my opinion,very good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the movie.i think that it was a way better if lydie denier knew karate also or if she knew to use some weapons,her character has become more interesting too and she was a decent opponent to cynthia.i think when the director filmed the final 'battle' between cynthia&denier he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be.all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie.it's not like 'yes,madam'! or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10

when you think of golf movies, you think of caddyshack, but what if there are kids around? go right to this movie! disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy. the acting in this movie, in my opinion, is quite good and the leading cast, for the most part, is very young! this movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique, seeing all the angles of the golf game. i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch. though the ending might be a little predictable, the movie does well on its own! it also shows that you do not need swearing, nudity, or violence to make a great golf movie!

when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video. i finally got around and rented it. i thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show "even stevens". when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. it started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that. all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it. the cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot.

if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time. oversentimental in places? sure, of course it is - and proud of it. it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that. big production values, simple telling, with creative shots: it is not complex, is a very nice and remarkably sweet film. it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton; and i bet his son gets that.the build-up is slow enough to be enjoyed, the conflicts feisty, and the british vs. americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore. i have minor gripes: the score wants to be james horner but is too overblown, and there are too many close-ups, and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent, and good-looking sports film then this is it.so here's the thing, and i feel like i know my film, but i actually liked it more than seabiscuit: which is a better film, but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! thanks, bill.

rainy day with not much to do. we were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting, so we gave it a chance.the more we watched, the more we became engrossed in the story. its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time (1913 i think) was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as seabiscuit and this is also based on a true story.the acting is believable and the casting is brilliant. and . . . . we are not golfers, so please don't miss this one just because its about golf. any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about the people. golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game.bottom line . . . . its a feel good movie. it's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two.

shia labeouf has impressed me before with his acting ability, but i can honestly say that i very much look forward to his next efforts...his portrayal of francis ouimet, a 20 year old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enters the 1913 us open tournament in his hometown...the beginning of the movie does drag a bit, but it's necessary to set up the underdog subplot that shia works so well...the entire cast is well-chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an ending everyone can discover before seeing the movie...but even knowing that information doesn't spoil the fun...josh flitter is delightful as eddie lowery, francis' caddy, who keeps him grounded and loose while at the same time proving to be an invaluable part of francis' effort...stephen delane is outstanding as harry vardon, the legendary british golfer who francis idolizes yet does not fear...and who knows the background francis comes from as he, too, had humble beginnings...bill paxton takes a formulaic movie and makes it worthwhile...bravo mr. paxton, and bravo to the cast...from the imagery to the story to the people who bring it alive, this is a movie to get, enjoy, and revel in...it's nice to have movies like this that we can feel good watching...
