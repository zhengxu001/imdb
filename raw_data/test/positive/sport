nuri bilge ceylan's 2002 film distant (uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white the small town- kasaba), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film clouds of may (mayis sikintisi). the earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. that clouds of may succeeded on any level was a testament to ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. however, distant is ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like ingmar bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding, and he lacks bergman's penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and yasujiro ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation ceylan reconfigures). the bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal istanbul (the fact that it snows in turkey will likely surprise some), which lends the film a definite bergmanian feel, as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from krzysztof kieslowski's the decalogue. the natural images invoke the best of werner herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscapes range from the nearly precisionist compositions of michelangelo antonioni to the cultural hagiography of woody allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from manhattan, save the lack of the brooklyn bridge in the background. in another scene, ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from ozu's tokyo story. yet, like all great artists, ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's needs. distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them, but it does not describe the film itself, for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the istanbul airport, and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. as he watches her, from a distance, we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. will she leave her husband and return to mahmut? not in this film. he pulls back behind a column, and nazan merely turns her head back to her future. mahmut is her past, and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. mahmut will never get it. most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. that some viewers will get the film, and that ceylan gets his own powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. distant does, albeit it at just the right length.

ý thýnk uzak ýs the one of the best films of all times and everybody must realize this movie.i m a turkish boy and a big cinema fun. and in this days our cinema industry is highing up.and uzak is the best turkish film of last ten years.and maybe one of the best films of all times.director nuri bilge ceylan is quite amazing.telling story,characters,atmosphere is wonderful.he is a minimalist director and tells about routine event family,dreams,expects,life.tells about you ,tells about me,tells about us.i promise you will find a piece of your body in this movie.cinema life welcomes a new director.he is waiting to realize.i promise yo you will love this movie please watch it

a study of one of those universally familiar, physical and/or emotional states: isolation. i think the film also comments on cultural displacement too.the film presents the experiences of two turkish men (cousins). one has money (and the comforts that come of having 'made-it' with a steady income); the other has none and goes in search of work. neither are happy. expect no celebration of life here - this is loneliness, warts and all.the film succeeds in offering a powerfully bleak traverse across the 'low lands' of the human condition. brave film-making. well-acted and well-shot in my view (outdoor shots by the harbour being my own favourites). a film that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfilment in life (not to mention employment); everyone else will find a companion in this film. a film with all the warmth and pace of an ice-floe. expect a bitter pill, not a 'happy pill.'

the only complaint i heard about this film was that it was slow. though, perhaps this is the point. the two characters clash unforgivingly and the slow build-up of tension between them is anxiety-producing. the intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience. istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, scenery captivating, and the plot is thrilling - not in that "look, the hero blew up yet another car and he's now flying with his motorcycle" kind of way, though. i had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog engulf istanbul.

perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself. what i want to point out here is that "distant" is not only an art-house film but one of the best art-house films. from all the art-house films i have seen, "distant" is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold. it is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovsky's nostalgia. one commentator got it right, that sex, a jaded, common feature among foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "distant" and in a good way. what is most remarkable about "distant" is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world. fortunately "distant" doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings.

this is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant turkish director, nuri bilge ceylan, whose last film mayis sikintisi -which was very cehovian- was shown in prestigious film festivals. differing from his previous films, the story of 'uzak' is set on istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world. however, in ceylan's film, we do see only minor traces of that huge crowd. rather he choose to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships. the photographer, who -we understand that- has also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited the customs of the city life, not only in material sense. in his relation to his relative, we see him first as caring and tolerant, however, when he could not find a job, our suburbian character starts to be disturbed for sharing his private 'space' with someone whose leaving date becomes ambiguous. i will not reveal the tactics he develops in order to pull his relative out of his life to prevent any harm on your viewing pleasure, but it is enough to say that ceylan shows us the tactics that we acquire within the routine of suburbian life; 'tactics' to keep our own private space, 'tactics' in order not to communicate with other people, 'tactics' to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature (since our own experience, we believe that, is complex enough).ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the borders of modern (or postmodern ?) city by depicting the two characters in different manners. but, he doesn't condemn any of the two characters for doing this, rather he uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference. for example, in search of new opportunities, we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces. even within the house, he prefers balcony as his favourite space. on the other hand, we see the photographer always within the closed spaces, and generally at his home. although there are more than 10 million people out there, and lots of adventures, lots of interesting things to discover (or are there any?) he prefers sitting at home, watching tv, etc. his home is like his temple, a kind of sacred place.everyone living in a big city, and conscious of the experience he is living through, will find something belonging to himself in uzak. if you like this film, i am sure that you will like ceylan's other two films, mayis sikintisi (the clouds of may) and kasaba (the town). go and find them!.

this is not a film to impress you with high budget, high-tech shots, fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director. but it's a film by a director who is also a very good photographer, who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human, not as an half-god unlike most of the directors. this is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best 'performances' with unreal or, at best, learned gestures and mimics. rather, it's a film in which they act as real as it can be. actually, they are not professional actors at all. the dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life. you tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words. you show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest. this is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life. and this is your chance to see yourself from outside, impersonated by the main characters. i saw all of the films of nuri bilge ceylan, incl. his short film koza (cacoon) thanks to those who puts it in the dvd. many would compare him with tarkovsky, ozu and maybe bresson or bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur. and he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life. that is the kind of sincerity you'll find in uzak.

like all good art, this movie could mean different things to different people. to me it means that failing to open your hart to the others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty live. the convenience of the selfishness is like the junk food: it feels good, but eventually could make you sick.almost everything i see in the us is a commercial mass production of action garbage, shallow dramas, and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic movie really touched me. thank you, nuri bilge ceylan (and all the other in the cast)!ivan yanachkov

following the collapse of yesilcam (turkey's answer to hollywood) in the mid '90s few but the most prescient of observers could have foreseen such a recent pique in the turkish film industry, arguably built upon the work of ex-photographer nuri bilge ceylan.uzak is the director's third feature and forms something of a trilogy with his two earlier pictures (kasaba and clouds of may), following similar themes and techniques. the film finds mahmoud, a commercial photographer, living alone in a small istanbul apartment only visited occasionally by his brusque, married lover. yusuf, his nephew, has left his village home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. the younger man stays with mahmoud while fruitlessly looking for work in the city, drinking in cafés and nervously observing young women he never approaches.the film's title is translated as "distant", and the film beautifully illustrates every possible connotation of the word; yusuf's physical distance from his home, mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him and the generational distance between the two men.ceylan's films rarely contain heightened dramatics, instead allowing full and rich characters to develop from within the tightly framed, static shots. he acts as director, producer, writer, cinematographer and co-editor and casts friends and family in many of the roles. such a confined, insulated approach to film-making might be expected to lead to films hard to infiltrate and connect with for most viewers, making uzak's undoubted humanity all the more impressive.ceylan is, however, a better cinematic formalist than dramatist, taking the reigns from such past masters of cinematic language as ozu and tarkovsky. after viewing uzak, i can think of few better suited to the task.

the first time i saw the poster, i was stunned by its tranquility and beauty. then the city of istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since.not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture. it itself is a landscape.actually there are a lot of things going on in the film, but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination, thus creating a really flat life. **(mild spoiler)one can see mahmut's ladylove crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight; one can see mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness. the most dramatic scene in the film to me is yusuf laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece,** and that's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring, lonely life bursting out in such a way.with all the trivialities in life weeded, the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets...and as the story unfolded, i sort of finally grasped their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things intervened, which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost, especially for an irresponsible artist like mahmut.i've just finished my second watching. last night, i crouched into my quilt, had some vodka beside my bed and went through the whole film in a trance. i felt two real lives going on, one outside the screen, one inside the screen. i felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety 'cause the people inside were experiencing it. i just had myself removed from all those things.we cannot deny the universal problem of communication, and loneliness even puts us far towards it, and it becomes a vicious spiral. i bet mahmut still didn't figure out a way of living in the end. that's why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world, the coldness and landscape.

penelope spheeris (of "wayne's world" fame) made her mark with the documentary "the decline of western civilization", about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s. most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which often turn violent). overall, we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: whereas the hippies were into being natural, the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible, what with spiked hair and all. but also, we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads.anyway, this is a really great time capsule. we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it. but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. truly worth seeing.

spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l.a. punk explosion of the early eighties. it's all there: not just great, great bands like black flag, fear, x, the germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh, shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. where is that today? the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. if you need a proof for that, watch fear's performance in decline. unmatched. great film! how come this is not available on vid, ld or dvd? p.s. the follow-up decline pt. ii is hilarious, too

first of all, i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed, the la punks.i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in finland.so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it? i like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, thus i know punks from all over europe & americas, so why do you, who find this music "repugnant" care to comment at all?

i saw this movie in the theater when i was 14 and it changed my life. i immediately cut off my hair and began buying all of the records of the bands in the movie. these were some of the seminal bands of l.a. punk rock caught on film at the peak of their powers. bands like black flag (pre-rollins), circle jerks, fear, x, and the germs have few equals in the history of punk music. i can't believe this film has never been put out on video or dvd. great movie for fans of punk rock.

8/2008. when i originally wrote my comments, shortly after first seeing this film, i took a critical view, feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically "phoned-in" their performances, which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously.but upon seeing it again, it seemed different, especially in view that neither of the two main mega-stars lived a great deal longer after its release.with the exception of spiner, all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience, and likewise unavoidably a lot "longer in tooth" than we've seen in many of their other film and t.v. work. but isn't almost everyone?seeing it again, while it certainly won't be regarded as a "classis" in any of their careers, it is a fun film, with a lot of interesting scenery as well.from my viewpoint, it reminds me that many films, plays, etc., can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint, or looking instead to the lighter side, without expecting a film to be another "citizen kane," "casablance," or (in terms of the two leads), another original "odd couple." it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau, as well as the others in the cast.

i have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore? the timeless music, the tender voices of william holden and jennifer jones leave this grown man weeping through joyous, romantic scenes and i'm not one who cries very often in life. where have our william holden's gone and will they make these moving, wonderful, movies any more? it's sad to have to realize that they probably won't but don't think about it, just try to block that out of your mind. even so, they won't have holden in it and he won't appear on that hill just once more either. you can only enjoy this film and watch it again.

directed by a veteran hollywood director henry king who began his career still in 1915, love is a many splendored thing was one of his last great films. it was based on a bestseller by han suyin called simply a many splendored thing the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem the kingdom of god by francis thompson where that many splendored word `love' was used in quite a different and rather transcendental context meaning the love of god. made in the 50s, the film marked along with works by such directors as douglas sirk and vincente minnelli a sort of renascence of melodrama, its florescence and reaching yet again a peak of popularity.  the story begins when a handsome american reporter mark elliott played by william holden yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible `playboy' roles comes to the hong kong and meets there a young and pretty han suyin (jennifer jones) of half-chinese half-english origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the chinese communists. instantly mark feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by han's heart left cold after the death of her husband (`i believe in human heart now only as a doctor'). but very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell mark and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing, even by the fact that mark is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by han's chinese origin. but still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternalness of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death, prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence. undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made, love is a many splendored thing features fine performances from william holden and jennifer jones, wonderful academy award winning musical score by alfred newman and extremely romantic, touching, heart-warming but ultimately heart-breaking story. don't miss that many splendored film. 8/10

i first saw this film in the mid 60's when i was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact the end scene where han suyin hears of mark's death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief, where you then hear mark's voice saying "give me your hand", and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with it's superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of love of han suyin, just left me sobbing my heart out. i was outwardly crying bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. i just left the room to be on my own. fortunately i do not react like that any more but i always cry at the end. i love everything about the film, the music mostly, the costumes of han suyin, and location. the beauty of jennifer jones and the handsome william holden, they were both at their best. i have the vhs and dvd of this wonderful movie. i also have two versions of the music & lyrics by arthur newman and sammy fain. i also have the book a many splendored thing by han suyin. i recommend this film 100%

holden and jones sizzle in this movie, but not in the way we think of sizzling today -- it's very subtle and under the surface -- yet palpable. jennifer jones, in particular, is so sexually hot in this film (much more than a caricature like monroe ever was) because she creates a real woman -- with all facets of womanhood: she's intelligent, intuitive, graceful. she's desiring and desirable. there's a scene on that famous hill, where she's lying down in the grass, looking up at holden, and the expression in her eyes is x-rated, yet in the context of the scene and character, in makes complete sense. you don't need to have it all said in the dialogue -- spelled-out like the crude obviousness in most modern films. it's all there in her eyes -- sexy yet elegant. what a stunning, under-rated actress she was. (i saw her madame bovary for the first time recently and was equally blown away.) i'll take her over bergman, davis, or the two hepburns any day.

two great stars and a legendary director created a magnificent throbbing love story that is memorable and moving on so many levels.henry king directed jennifer jones in her first hit song of bernadette and he again directs jennifer jones in this film and miss jones is perfect in this role and gives a edgy, beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and bill holden who hit home run after home run in the l950's with a series of smash hit films beginning with sunset blvd, stalag 17, born yesterday,country girl, picnic, and of course river kwai is superb in this role.hard to imagine anyone but holden in this movie i loved the ending and cry every time i see it. for anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. for those who haven't, you won't.

this movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. nevertheless i enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of william holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of jennifer jones. there are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines. the cinematography of hong kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. all in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.

those prophetic words were spoken by william holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous jennifer jones (as a eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. they start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. in hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. beautiful hong kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by alfred newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially jones (directed here by henry king, who also did "the song of bernadette - 1943, an oscar for jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper.

we all want to fall in love... the experience makes us feel completely alive, where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified... it may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon, but that doesn't reduce its value, because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives...i love watching people fall in love... it must have something to do with the excellent chemistry between the main characters...mark elliott, a charming sensitive american war correspondent, arrives in hong kong at the dawn of the korean war... he finds in han suyin an awesome beauty of true grace...han suyin, a lovely eurasian doctor is captivated by mark's tenderness and insight...it was instant attraction when they first met... the two commence a passionate affair, leading them to fall deeply in love...their love is so strong, so wonderfully expressed that highlights elliot's married status, and the difficulties of the troubled time of the korean war, communism and race relations... holden is an inspired choice for the role... not only does he have an imposing screen presence, but he brings the perfect mix of enlightenment, compassion and emotion to the part...opposite him oscar winner jennifer jones, perfect in her oriental look, radiantly beautiful in that traditional and modern asian-inspired cheongsam... jones floods her role with personal emotion giving her character a charismatic life of its own... she delivers a heartfelt performance turning her character into a woman who undergoes a spiritual and emotional awakening...her scene in that verdant hill where she takes refuge is exquisitely touching specially when we heard mark's voice whispering: "we have not missed you and i... that many-splendored thing."henry king - who has established himself as a masterful director of romances - spreads the theme tune (by alfred newman) in the air above the cosmopolitan harbor... his film is colorful, elegant, with excellent cinematography and set design...nominated for eight academy awards, this beautiful and sensitive motion picture won three: best costume design; best music and best score...

this delightful movie tells the story of buds. and it's incredible. you'll laugh, and you'll smile, and you'll laugh. it's really all about the laughs. when jon bon jovi is funny in a movie, it's a heck of a movie! 'nuff said. now go watch it!

homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks, but deserves better. when i first saw it, i had a luke-warm reaction. but, over time, it's really grown on me--no pun intended ;-). the more i see it, the more i appreciate it. the writing is top-notch, as is the acting. throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction, and you end up with a great little film.it's also good to finally see hank azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role. and thornton delivers his usual quality performance. even relative newcomer ryan phillippe delivers, playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety.on a side note, homegrown is simply a "must see" if you're a billy bob thornton fan. it appears stephen gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier thornton projects like one false move and sling blade (though homegrown is certainly a lot more tongue-in-cheek than either). and thornton's role as a character who is both sophisticated and down-to-earth is a perfect match for the actor.

i was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when i first saw it i was only mildly amused! i must say however, that i am still very disappointed that donald o'connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! he was an enormous talent.there is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and matthau has never been funnier.i am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see lemmon and matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. brent spiner proves that "data" from star trek the next geeration is not the only good character he can play.the storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and i laughed heartily throughout this movie and i highly recommend it.

b.b. thornton proves to be a great actor in this little seen movie. thornton really gets into his characters--literally. i caught this on cable one night and enjoyed it. too bad it was released nationwide in theaters the same year as "fear and loathing" and "half-baked."

this movie was good. i can't say it was one of the best, but it still was good. the only reason that i watched it was because of ryan phillippe. he is soo hot! (don't get mad reese). but i think that it was sort of funny- not a laugh your head out kinda thing, but still o.k.

you looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? well locate this little sleeper. john lithgow and billy bob thorton are great in this little plot twister. don't forget the cameo by jamie lee curtis. a touch of the 60's, a touch of "the prince and the pauper", and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a greast little story.

if it wasn't meant to be a comedy, the filmmakers sure goofed. if they intended for it to be a comedy, they hit the mark. our critic says homegrown is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit, recommends it for all audiences, and says that he really liked jamie lee curtis's performance. it deserves a theatrical re-release.

after seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film. i mean, i don't care for stupid "stoner comedies." i'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from the simpsons and some guy named "billy bob." should have been a good time, but the film's just not that funny--too bad somebody had to go and bum their high.unfortunately, i found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters, so i had to wait for the video. i really enjoyed it. nice locations, quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast. looking back at it, the plot twists weren't totally unexpected, but i didn't find it cumbersome because the premise was so engaging.so why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? did something happen to the producer, leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves?

walter matthau and jack lemmon, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. this film is just another example of this.this time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board.of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys. it's hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner rue mclanahan.too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o'connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. matthau falls for dyan cannon, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous elaine stritch. unknown to them, matthau has no money either. the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven, looking lovelier than ever.the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.

jack lemmon and walter matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together. they have made lots of movies together, i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie. out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch. i give the movie 10 out of 10. jack lemmon and walter matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv. they will be sadly missed. god bless you both.

i'm not here to tell you "armored" is kubrickian, hitchcockian or fellini-esquire. nope. referenced directors are more like don siegel ("charlie varrick") and walter hill ("the warriors"). those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies. no skirts need apply. they unapologetically made guy movies. guns, lots of guns. men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. their movies were like a sap to the head. you want a friend? get a dog."armored" is so a guy movie. dueling armored trucks? bloody gunshot wounds? exploding money? if that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited, then stay away.at 88 minutes, "armored" is all muscle without an ounce of fat. we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks, three per truck. the six, led by matt dillon, scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks. their mission one day is to deliver $42 million from the federal reserve (i think). the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse, stash the cash, then stage a hijack. sure, the cops will suspect them, but if they stick together they'll get through it.trouble is, one of the six, played by columbus short, is a holdout. at first. but he faces eviction. and he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother. he needs cash bad.matt dillon cajoles, pleads, persuades the holdout. no blood on anyone's hands. a clean getaway. all good, no bad. you'll be rich forever. blue skies smiling at you ...right.everything goes to hell, of course. it's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up. and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles. in fact, the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay. i happen to like industrial urban decay.kudos to matt dillon, who plays the top bad dog. he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie. love that guy.also, credit is due to the menacing, throbbing, blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy. i am guessing he's heard a few tangerine dream records.also, it's surprising that this is a pg-13 movie. i caught one  one!  f-bomb in this entire movie about violent tough-guy robbers. on some level, i like that. take the kids.the director is nimrod antal, a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called "kontroll." screenwriter is an out-of-nowhere guy called james v. simpson.a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out. i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers.

i just finished watching following and i thought it was great. i rated it 8 out of 10. i plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolan's more recent movie memento. following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for memento. even the music in some parts is very similar.shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. the story and dialogue is really good. the performance of the actors is believable.christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget. i look forward to his next release insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino.

i remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of donald crowhurst in 1968, in the golden globe single handed around the world yacht race. i was a 13 year old, living in england. the previous year francis chichester (later sir francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. i remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white tv!) and then his knighting by the queen. it provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the uk. it all seems so quaint now. chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped half way, in australia, to re-fit his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping.it's important to remember that this was a world pre-gps, when communications on land were still pretty erratic, never mind in the middle of the ocean. now with gps receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth, it's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally, vanish. as donald crowhurst did. a number of yachtsmen signed up (all men back then), including mystery man, crowhurst. essentially a weekend sailor, crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise, including careers in the british army, the air force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. he wanted to do something big with his life, and he saw the five thousand pound first prize (well over $100,000 in today's money) and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business. he signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat, and which meant failure would bankrupt him, and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race. now the brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the 'pros'. (think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race.) the public queued up to see him set off, but his boat wasn't really ready, and even as he started (the last competitor to leave the uk) crowhurst must have known he didn't seriously have a chance. but too much was riding on him to quit.in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife's face. left behind with their 4 children, she is interviewed movingly throughout the film, together with one of crowhurst's sons. she was in a no-win situation. had she attempted to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but afterward she was riven with doubt, as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him. faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. laid up offshore argentina and brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic, thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe. he elaborately falsified his logs, and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan. but as one after another the other competitors dropped out, he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized. unable to face certain detection, his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. his yacht was found. he never was. this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic french sailor, who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize, when he abruptly left the race, unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder, eventually pulling up some 10 months later in tahiti. having spent some seven years working at sea myself, (albeit on very different ships to these) i well understand the pull of the ocean. standing on deck, seeing water in every direction to the horizon, knowing there's a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull, without easy access to tv or radio (even nowadays on most working ships, you feel pretty isolated), it's possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea, the search for self. i strongly suspect that robin knox johnston, the ex navy guy who won the race (and many since) probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off, which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route. those who went searching for something profound within themselves, may not have entirely liked what they found. the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this, (did it really look quite that bad? i don't remember it looking quite so dowdy, but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie. highly recommended.

this is a gem. as a film four production - the anticipated quality was indeed delivered. shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films, well arranged and simply gripping. it's long yet horrifying to the point it's excruciating. we know something bad happened (one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews) but we are compelled to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories, as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him, wondering why they didn't stop him in time. it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very-well made documentary.

deep water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. the testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late 1960's and a ground-breaking round the world yacht race. the personal conflicts of duty to family, self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films i have seen. i was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. the story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed. most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters. this movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense, joy and drama.

this is an account of events that have been covered in print several times, and i had read two books - 'a voyage for madmen' and 'the strange last voyage of donald crowhurst' before seeing the film in sheffield just before christmas. i must say, it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 sunday times golden globe yacht race. these men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no gps, and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece. not to mention the months of solitude, the thundering southern ocean, little sleep, and boats that were often literally falling apart around them.this documentary is excellently put together in my opinion, tightly edited, well paced with superb narration. the archive footage and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life. clare crowhurst's interview footage is especially revealing and moving as she relates the events that led up to her husband, donald crowhurst's departure from teignmouth, the doubts and fears in his mind and her reaction as subsequent events unfolded.i was moved and had even shed a tear or two by the time the credits started rolling, and overheard other people expressing similar feelings.the two books i mentioned above are useful for more detail and back-story which couldn't have been fitted into the 90 minutes and i would recommend those too.this is ultimately a true story of human courage and human frailty. a must see for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human endeavour and real-life heroes.

1931 also presented "an american tragedy", the original tale of "who will he take up with, poor girl or rich girl". this was a truly entertaining film. babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. monroe owsley, unmemorably played babs's husband. i had never heard of him, but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing crosby of "the big broadcast" ('32), even a receding hairline and wingy ears. ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a true movie pioneer going wayyy back. the dilemma is resolved at the end, to the strains of the title and i believe annette hanshaw had the hit recording, although the off-screen voice did very well. i also enjoyed the dance hall scenes. i'm sure they were authentic; the band, a leading one of the time was superb. good job, lionel barrymore!!!!

one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore, "ten cents a dance" stars barbara stanwyck as the dance-hall girl "barbara" in her sixth role. stanwyck looks quite "plain-jane" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. then along comes rich guy bradley carlton (ricardo cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (cortez and stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) then she meets eddie, who's very different from the dashing carlton. the writer, jo swerling, had worked on some biggies (its a wonderful life, guys and dolls, and gone with the wind) so i was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary. the story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru, and is very similar to "the bride walks out" from 1936, also starring stanwyck.... t.b.w.o. is much more clever, but also more tame, due to on-slaught of the hays code...

this is one of barbara stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. she's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall. she really doesn't like the work, but it's a living. her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy ricardo cortez. well, after marrying, it turns out her "nice guy" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy. by the end of the film, barbara simply has had enough, as any sane woman would walk from this horrid marriage.in the 1920s and early 30s, hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. while ten cents a dance isn't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened production code was created and enforced starting in 1934. in some ways the code was great--after all, parents didn't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in ben hur, 1925). however, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no 1934 and thereafter. this is really a shame, as i don't think ten cents a dance was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (barbara stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. even so, allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldn't have been.overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. give this one a look.fyi--sadly, ricardo cortez was actually not hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was jewish. he was an excellent leading man of his time, but today is all but forgotten.

this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun, not great but entertaining.based on a song by rogers & hart that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe owsley. she and owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses cortez, who still holds out hope. she helps hubby get a job in cortez's company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (yup! i know, it's pretty funny....). finally he embezzles $5,000 from cortez, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to cortez....and i won't reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished. owsley is the weak point; he's unattractive and sniveling, while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.while ostensibly a drama, it's filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. but there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point stanwyck says to cortez, "my brains are in my feet, while yours are in...." that's pretty darn suggestive for 1931! there's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the code clamped down and whitewashed everything. an amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.

this is a forgotten classic of a film, and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for "gummo". gummo is good, river's edge is way, way better. its no secret that keanu reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. no, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. but, he was born for some roles: ted preston, esquire from bill and ted, and his role in this film. he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. then there's crispin glover. i think his performance in this film is the best of his career. he is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character. then there's dennis hopper, who is perfect as well. this movie is simply amazing, and if you haven't seen it, run out and watch it today. its brilliant. one of the best portrayals of modern america i've seen.

"river's edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw "blue velvet", you know thats saying something. viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated "kids". the previews for "kids" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. in reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. "river's edge" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better. the only times it goes from being disturbing to distasteful is the constant image of the dead nude body. outside of that, the film is thought-provoking and, for all its minor flaws, quite realistic.keanu reeves, known for being a particularly wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burned-out teenager. ione skye is equally sympathetic and likable. dennis hopper (on the comeback trail with this, "blue velvet", and "hoosiers") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover. crispin glover, while always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group. the best performance however is definitely daniel roebuck. as the murderer john, roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. its a shame he didn't become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than reeves.the film is overall fantastic and daring. don't mistake this for another lame john hughes clichéd high school flick such as "the breakfast club". this is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. fans of this movie are advised to check out a canadian film from 1981 called "out of the blue", directed by dennis hopper. its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, may have been an influence on "river's edge". (7/10)

river's edge is more than just the story of a murder. it's an indictment of the wave of apathy that has plagued pockets of youth for decades now. our main characters are a group of what my high school would have referred to as "stoners". one of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to "talk sh*t" to him. this dangerous young man played by daniel roebuck has an intensity that will startle you. he takes the other kids in the group out to show them his girlfriend's body, and strangely enough, nobody seems really freaked out about it. the balance of the film punctuates the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how guilt is eventually able to worm its way inside even these apathetic kids.river's edge is certainly not condoning or championing the behavior of its characters. we clearly see the dangers presented by such unchecked apathy and having only the desire to get drunk or high. we are shown the dysfunctional home lives these kids have, and perhaps this is meant to explain their awful behavior. but could it only be unstable homes that lead to this type of destructive living? crispin glover is his usual whacked-out self. he drives around town in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. he tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime, but clearly he does not understand what could have made the young man do it. dennis hopper plays an older man these kids get their dope from. though he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the apathy and rage of the younger generation. witness his confused reaction as roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. as wild as hopper's character is, even he knows this young man should not be walking the face of the earth.what will you think of these kids? well, there is really no way to like their characters. some are less despicable than others, but you cannot help either hating or feeling sorry for them. twenty years later, there is still an apathy alive and well in a great many young people out there. when do these kids get lost? what makes so many of them want to act anti-social? this film, and the questions it poses about teenagers will stick with you for a while. that's a fact.8 of 10 stars.the hound.

i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life, and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on.

i think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting to me. it is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on the simpsons. layne is jimbo, john is kearney, and tony is dolph. there is even an episode of the simpsons where jimbo uses the line "i poked her with a stick."the jimbo-layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. kearney has the shaved head, unlike john, but is the big, dumb one. the tony-dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long, parted haircut and even the second-tier status.

crispin glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. he gives layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. as well as feck, which role is done very well by dennis hopper. it's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult. rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers. i really enjoyed it watching. i saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice 80s feel, this is the one that you have to see. i'ts a same that i didn't know of it earlier.

i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie. it was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom "hahaha, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid".um. yeah. turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say watch this movie! it is just.....bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then. this is a good "human interest" and showcases some strange sides of the psyche.

i have seen this movie three times. going back to vcr's, in the 1980's, and again on the encor channel last night (feb.11, 2010). based on a true story which i remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, i've decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again. yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. the creepiest character is joshua john miller, who plays keeanu reeves little brother. (the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet -- just google it. it's about anthony jacques broussard who murdered marcy conrad in milpitas, california, in 1981.) the characters portray generation x pre-grunge, borderline sociopaths, with the exception of keeanu reeves, who grows a conscience.old hippies did a great job raising that generation.for such a young kid, i thought joshua miller was excellent, as the serial killer in the making character. in actuality, he went to yale, and has written screenplays as well as directed. his acting capabilities in this film were amazing. just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll, and tearing up her dolls grave, gave me the shivers. it gave me nightmares. even with whats happening in our world today, in 2010, it still is the most degenerate film i've seen to date. the apathy, and dysfunction, of these families, is enough to make one puke. this thrill kill almost makes the manson murders pale in comparison. crispon glover got a little too much into character. he wound up on david lettermen to discuss his role, and almost kicked the host in the head. apparrently glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. also, fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper. you're one of the best!

to speak relatively, if one were only to see now hector babenco's "pixote" (1981, brazil;pronounced as "pi-shot"), after having seen quite a number of films that deal with street children, juvenile delinquents, kids in trouble (truffaut's "the 400 blows", bunuel's "los olvidados", de sica's "shoeshine", nair's "salaam, bombay!", bresson's "mouchette", nugroho's "leaf on a pillow", etc.), one might be afraid that the plight of the kid portrayed in the film might not affect one anymore, having been "de-synthesized" already after going through the emotional roller-coaster ride put in motion by the previously quoted films.thankfully, that won't be the case. for babenco narrates his film in such a matter-of-fact manner ("artlessly", as one film reviewer put it, in a positive light) and that his central child performer, fernando ramos da silva (13 years old at that time and a street kid himself), gives such a no-frills, wounded performance, raw in its simplicity (that hardened face, those lonely and longing eyes) that one is hard put not to be pierced in any way. (such a feeling may achieve such a heightened realism when one learns that the child had only lived but a short life, having been involved in street crimes after the film and subsequently murdered.)in about first half of the film, pixote and his fellow street kids and delinquents spend their time in a repressive state-run reformatory school, where brutalization and humiliation, rape and murder, are the norm and culture;where they are forced to confess to their "crimes", on the flimsy notion that under the brazilian law, underage felons are not "punishable" for their offenses. for these kids, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation provided by these supposed well-meaning authorities. within the walls of this supposed protective establishment, these young souls are soon to discover that love and care from parental figures are likewise nowhere to be found, if not to a degree worser.(for pixote, the only form of escape comes from puffing grass and sniffing glue, secretly smuggled inside the reformatory.)when the kids burst themselves into a small-scale "revolt" to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to get back to the outside world--their "home"--the intensity and form are of such a kind that one can't avoid thinking of the schoolboys' revolt in jean vigo's influential "zero for conduct". it's only that in "pixote", the "uprising" is made to appear on a gutter level.once pixote and his small group are back on the streets (the film's second half), they engage in robbery, pimping and drug-dealing to fend for themselves, along which they get to meet sueli, a battered but kindly prostitute. sueli willingly accomodates the four lost souls, in such a way that she allows her customers to be robbed by them and that she provides more than motherly care (at least to one of the children).one would have thought that the street kids have at long last found the one person who can provide them the love and warmth that have been sorely lacking in their lives. but as dubious as the freedom that these kids believe the streets are providing, this new-found "maternal figure" cannot but stay forever. jealousy, squabbles, differences, and murder have only set the kids apart--and for good. and during that defining scene where pixote, prompted by the circumstance, gets to shoot not just sueli's arrogant american customer but also his fellow street urchin ditto (more than a son to sueli), he thereafter literally goes back to "infancy", as he sucks from the right breast of the disoriented woman, right there and then materializing his lingering desire for parental affection, the image itself both sad and unsettling.it is so that sueli, in a probable coming back to her "senses", lamentably pushes back pixote from his "nourishing" position and rejects him, for good. thus, in a quietly wrenching moment, pixote, with that young-old face and those sullen eyes (not entirely dissimilar, though in a different context, to the young boy's mien in elem klimov's harrowing "come and see"), gets himself up, puts on his coat and takes his gun (yes, a gun!), and sets off to nowhere, walking along the train tracks and with the morning light just beginning to show up. with that scene, babenco may just be doing an homage (amongst many other homages found in different films!) to the iconoclastic final scene in truffaut's "the 400 blows".but whereas we got to know what has become of antoine doinel three years later in the short film "antoine et colette" (as well as in three other feature films in the years thereafter), we are left grappling in the dark as to what lies ahead for pixote after he finally disappears from the last frame, that being the last time that we'll get to see this real-life street child (notwithstanding the fate that eventually befell him in actuality)."pixote" may not be as nearly as whimsical as "the 400 blows" or as hallucinatory as "los olvidados", but it still stands out among films of similar theme and texture because of its simple, raw power.

pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality. and yet i more than imagine hector babenco owes some of his film-making chops with this film to vittorio de sica's neo-realist style, in particular shoeshine (that film, as with pixote, takes place mostly inside a children's prison). and yet while i might still prefer de sica's film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is, no pun intended, like choosing between two children. they're both marvelous works of raw drama, and with pixote babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions brought on after a world war. this is how it was in brazil- one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in city of god, perhaps in some of the same locations- and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made. some aren't alive some 20+ years later, for all anyone knows.the "star", pre-teen street kid fernando ramos da silva, plays the title character, a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him, and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys. the conditions couldn't be much worse, and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty. there's a riot, and an escape, and halfway through the film we find pixote with a few other youths, including lilica a practical transvestite not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever to get by. none of this, i should repeat, is shown with a kind of ham-fisted earnestness- certainly you would never in a million years see ron howard or paul haggis direct this kind of picture- and yet there's an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is trivialized.nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for pixote, and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn, and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older (though not by much at all) and become things that will haunt this person forever. despite babenco's usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing feels forced. as with de sica, maybe more-so given the consistent conditions of san paolo and rio street kids, he's a natural director of children, and coax's out of ramos da silva and jorge julião and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of "cinematic" drama (that is not so real that it becomes documentary, which isn't a bad thing per-say) and even subtlety in some scenes.pixote may not be as well known as it's later 21st century brazilian films that look back on the horrors of rio, or even neo-realist films, but it should be. anyone wanting to get a good, hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and soak in what is the best foreign film of 1981.

i lack cable-vision and no longer have "directv". so being a rural resident i have to wait for dvd releases. being a lover of blondes but not blonds, i of course not only have "barb wire", but i have "stripperella: the complete first season". i've not yet found "vip" or a second season for stripperella. i have the "baywatch hawaiian wedding" dvd. i have the issues of "playboy" that pamela denise anderson posed in. i could go on. i love pamela! there is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying stripperella. but there are certain elements that i dislike, but live with, for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too, some times. but those are my personal peeves and i try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me. i too was taken aback by the change in animation style, but i adapted. however, the amount of female nudity decreased, and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this. but then again i adapted. one of my favorite episodes of "mork & mindy" was when they got to meet robin williams! so of course one of my favorite episodes of "striperella" is when pamela & tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! if there really is a "season 2" i hope that i can find it, for as a completest, i need to complete my collection. i recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. (hey! psst! "blonde" & "blondes" are the feminine form for spelling "blond"! your software should already know that!)

"stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named erotica jones (voiced by pamela anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as "the tender loins" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as stripperella, a.k.a. agent 69 who works for a government organization. as stripperella, erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun. the creator of the character and the series is stan lee of marvel fame (and creator of spider-man).back in late june of 2003, spike tv (then known as the new tnn) premiered a thursday night block of three animated shows. those shows were "ren & stimpy: adult party cartoon"; new adventures of classic kids show characters ren and stimpy for adults done by original creator john kricfalusi, "gary the rat"; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring kelsee grammar of "cheers" and "fraiser" fame, and "stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by pamela anderson and created by stan lee. i remember seeing all three of the premiers. i was anxious to see ren and stimpy as i love the original show. i was a little let down. it was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. though gary the rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily stripperella. the animation was really good, it had an awesome intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was funny as hell! the show was just so silly, i don't even know how to begin explaining it! after four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because i know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. i was disappointed to see stripperella go but several months later i found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 am. i only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and i was glad to see the show back after all that time, something seemed a bit off....in the beginning of it's short run, "stripperella" had great animation. it was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. the stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. after the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. stripperella received the biggest changes though. before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than peggy bundy's (married with children) if even possible. also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. in short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, "stripperella" only ran one season but it was a very good show. like the tales from the crypt film "bordello of blood", it may be really campy but it's really fun. as long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. i haven't seen every episode because i haven't got the dvd yet for two reasons: #1. paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released tv shows, even though this was the entire show (i would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with pamela anderson and stan lee) and #2. the awesome kid rock song during the opening was replaced. now i'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang was the theme for the show! if your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. the show also had a few interesting guest stars such as john lovitz as cheapo and mark hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. also tom kenny (spongebob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. stan lee has a cameo in one episode too.the breakdown: pros: had a great look to it at first, funny as hell, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, chief strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.cons: the mid-series animation change and the crappy dvd described earlier. aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times i have nothing really negative to say about this.overall: stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. it was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that i hope to see air on adult swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like family guy. check it out even if it is on the lousy dvd. you will laugh yourself silly.rated tv-ma: crude and sexual humor and nudity, runtime: about 25 minutes per episode, score: 9/10

the best bit in the film was when alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. it was also brilliant to see alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.i've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. a brilliant idea by the script writers. alan must be brought back into eastenders so he can do the same to peggy.alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor. watch out if you're a girl and he finds you and pulls your knickers down.

i love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was rose. rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? does our society teach this? can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? to what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? how is a "typical" human alike or different than rose? lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like france or italy? i loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me, while it entertained, stimulated, and kept me guessing to the end! every time i've watched it, i have learned more about the film and myself.

------ spoilers----- spoilers----- spoilers--------just a few small ones saw this on satilite channel, missed the first 30 min of movie, will keep this comment short and informative.the movie is basically about 5 characters,the acting is very bad for afew characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2. this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical, mysterious and ... you get the point; but do to their own, personal, lack in thinking they fall terribly short. like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd - looks the part but his tongue can't speak it. the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly - unknowingly i believe - that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any - exactly as it was said. the ending was bad as well. but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady, although she, as well as the rest, had a lot of cliché s.so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above? simple, i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller - one sexy a$$ momma. she is fine lol. i am an appreciator of beauty, and she is exactly that. but don't get me confused because i'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way. their is somethin about her i cant explain, but i like it. i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out, bumps into keller. she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance. he throws her down, kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down, no panties ;). now, although she has an amazing ass - and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think - it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted it, and that look had me thinking i was behind that. i would have torn that booty up! after that expression, i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore, i was in love. lol. i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn't playing the lead role, i would have changed the channel.. well... after i had seen the scene i mentioned above. i am a lisa keller fan know, but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor, seeing this 2003 movie is her latest. but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it.

i'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. however, seizing me is really an amazing piece of work. the story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. my partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. it was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to "get tea" and i felt compelled to have a shower. the story was gripping but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one straight shot. (it delves into the gritty and grimy side of people, but doesn't leave you there). i thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time. i would highly recommend this one. still be prepared for an experience you might not be expecting.

clayton moore made his last official appearance on screen as the masked man in director lesley selander's epic adventure "the lone ranger and the lost city of gold," co-starring jay silverheels as his faithful indian scout tonto. selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit. this fast-paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of native americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in hollywood oaters after director delmar daves blazed the trail with the james stewart western "broken arrow." racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the robert schaefer and eric freiwald screenplay. having written 13 episodes of "the lone ranger" television series, schaefer and freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula, but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing. our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. the mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don't have to guess what is happening.although the violence in this selander saga appears tame by contemporary standards, the fact that the lone ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double-crossing accomplice by hurling a tomahawk that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious. the television series never went to this length, and when the lone ranger wielded his six-gun, he shot the gun out of the villain's fist rather than blow him away. the other discrepancy here is the indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman. douglas kennedy didn't have the villainous statue of lyle bettger who menaced the masked man in director stuart heisler's "the lone ranger," but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful indians."the lone ranger and the lost city of gold" opens with a recap of the masked protagonist's origins as an ambushed texas ranger and his transformation into the lone ranger with tonto serving as his sidekick. this opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series-oriented character off to a start so that everybody, including non-lone ranger fans, is on equal footing. the primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and callednot surprisinglythe hooded raiders begins with them killing indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. the lone ranger and tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. taking the baby and the dead indian, they ride to a nearby spanish mission supervised by padre vincente esteban (ralph moody of "the outsider") and turn the infant and body over to him. initially, the padre has to assure an indian maiden, paviva (lisa montell of "gaby"), that the masked man means them no harm and is their friend. padre sends tonto off to town to fetch the doctor, dr. james rolfe (dean fredericks of "gun fever"), and tonto promptly runs into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman, sheriff oscar matthison (charles watts of "giant"), who abhors indians. tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff's jail and matthison's men start to rough him up when rolfe intervenes and rides back to the mission.eventually, the lone ranger and tonto are able to capture one of the hooded raiders, but an indian redbird (maurice jara of "drum beat"), and his fellow braves abduct the henchmen and take him back to their village. they stake him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. chief villain ross brady (douglas kennedy of "hell's crossroads") and his cohort william (lane bradford of "devil's canyon") ride out to the village and brady uses his winchester to kill his captured henchman. little does brady know that his henchman talked. the lone ranger and tonto arrive not long afterward and reprimand redbird for his perfidy. redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the lone ranger decides to adopt a disguise so that he can learn more. he masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent.despite its concise 83-minute running time, "the lone ranger and the lost city of gold" lacks neither excitement nor surprises. selander keeps the action moving ahead at a full gallop. the dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable as schaefer and freiwald push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises, but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good indian theme. there is also a scene where the lone ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when supreme court chief justice earl warren had embarked on the high court's landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation, civil rights, separation of church and state, and police arrest procedure in the united states. one thing that differentiates "the lone ranger and the lost city of gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the spanish conquistadors with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. generally, lone ranger stories confined themselves to the 19th century without dragging in european history. no, the lone ranger wasn't the first movie to deal with spanish conquistadors. robert d. webb's "the seven cities of gold" (1955) concerned the spanish searching the southwest for the eponymous places, but selander's western beat gordon douglas' "gold of the seven saints" (1961) to the screen.

this second full-length lone ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. the ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. there are more killings and violence usually associated with lone ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. the ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice. clayton moore and jay silverheels star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus country of old tucson to good advantage. the music score is good but the familiar william tell overture theme is nudged aside by vocals that are interesting but lack the flourish and beauty of the ranger's traditional theme.

the lone ranger & tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the lone ranger discovers from a conversation with the indian chief tomache that each man possessed a medallion. the five medallions given by tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. can the lone ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it? is there really a lost city of gold somewhere upon native land? watching this, i kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed really familiar until eventually i realized i had seen this exact same movie when i was but a little kid..suddenly the memories flooded back and i remembered having quite a fun time as a child enjoying this one with a bunch of my friends. as an adult though, the plot is somewhat predictable but you know this, while not quite in the same league as the 1956 film, remains a lot of fun to watch. clayton moore is perfect as the lone ranger and jay silverwheels as tonto steals a lot of this movie as he's probably in more action scenes than even the lone ranger. there's some very familiar faces on hand here including douglas kennedy as ross brady, headman of the hooded raiders gang, charles watts as a bigoted sheriff, and ralph moody as a kindly padre.

a wounded tonto standing alone to protect three innocent lives. a devious woman masterminding a deadly plot. racial tension. smart indians.these are things we rarely if ever saw in the tv series, but this movie adds them all into the mix. while this is most certainly a lone ranger movie, it mixes up the formula just enough that those who grew tired of the series would probably still enjoy it. definitely recommended for any fan.

back when in the states, i was like about 7 or 8, i always woke early, just to watch this, together with a whole bunch of other cartoons like hootkloot, the road runner show, the pink panther. but this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funny animated works out there, and i still find it very funny today, i'll never forget the episodes, like the one where two aardvarks were fighting over the can of chocolate ant pudding? or the one where the aardvark is trying to reach the island where all the ants are at, and my personal favorite, the one where the ant, the aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital, which would later be the basis of a similar looney toon cartoon with sylvester, tweety and the bulldog. this is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there in which anyone would love to revisit, i would. an excellent series.

after seeing meredith in "beyond the prairie" i had to buy another film with her staring. i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. it's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen. save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on "beyond the prairie". it's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. perhaps some of her latest might fit but i haven't seen them. she has the smile of a cathrine bell and eyes of dana delany with a much younger body.

a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.all too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. full ride's matt sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre. matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager, both over-confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical by turns. influenced by amy, matt grows into a man of character and heart. he, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player.full ride has all the elements we love to see in a movie--great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, poignant drama, and a love story. still, while one may have seen these elements in other films, full ride is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally, even moving. perhaps what's most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality. although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree, (clearly a disgruntled student who, for quite obvious reasons, received a poor grade in his film class) director mark hoeger grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town. these characters are real people rooted in realistic situations, which often create the most compelling entertainment. on one level it is a love story, on another it is a character study, and yet another it is a simple football film. all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.

the make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other. matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. he's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. he overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail amy. he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice. when they do talk he can't show her who he really is. she empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments. she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit. (for me.) i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty, . . . girl next door pretty, i call it. so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up.funny things happen with the coach, but matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. the football scenes at the end were perplexing. matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back. folks, he isn't the right size! he's fifty pounds too light for that position. but i thought his acting was skilled. i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe. the film was all right. meredith m was better than all right.

to sum this story up in a few sentences: a teenage girl (amy) uses her hot body and "supposed" virginity to entice a young troubled guy (matt) with a potential football scholarship to provide her a "full ride" out of town. come to find out she has quite the reputation & has slept with many football players in the past hoping they would offer her the same deal. both of these kids have come from troubled & dysfunctional homes. matt's mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends & amy's mother had a bad reputation herself & got pregnant with amy at a a young age. matt falls in love with amy & tries to straighten out his life for her. very predictable ending. the actress that plays "amy" is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenager!

i liked this movie. i wasn't really sure what it was about before i started watching it, but enjoyed it nonetheless. it was about a girl (meredith monroe) whose mom didn't want her to turn out like she did. she meets and falls in love with a boy (riley smith) who is town for a charity football game. it's a good movie. i just hope it will be on again or comes out on video.

i saw this movie when it aired on the wb and fell in love with riley smith immediately. i would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more. i wish they'd air it again or cast riley smith in another movie!

beautiful coming of age romance about an english boy and french girl who run off, and grow up.i saw this movie as a teenager and loved it. i saw it again this year and loved again.

when i first heard about this movie, i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. i noticed the music was by elton john, so i figured i had nothing to loose, so i got it. what a surprise!!! the movie was awesome. it was true love is all about. the characters (paul and michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. i recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked. i think that only made the movie more realistic. the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert

i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. the music and scenery are beautiful. i purchased the vhs tape a few years ago and watch it frequently. i would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older elton john music.

i too saw this movie when it first came out. i was a teenager at the time, and i saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. i remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. the cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. the boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. i thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. i have not seen the movie since and i wander why it has gone to the wayside. i would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as i remember. the elton john sound track was excellent.

my wife and i saw this when we were 17. the only good thing my father ever did (get us in). this is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". michelle's song is "our" song. yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? the movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. she is left alone with child. it is a love story and a "growing up" story. the music is fantastic, and the story is one any person could relate to. may be someday this will be released on dvd.

i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. what a movie. i am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and i would like them to see this movie. i would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older elton john music.i have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.i bought some old movies like " melody" in hong kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this. i am also looking at the sequel, paul & michelle.can anyone please tell me how to get a copy of the vhs or dvd or vcd.really appreciate it.many thanks.

i was drawn to "friends" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston. i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called "seasons", then i found the elton john song "friends" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. anyway, the flood of the emotions of "friends" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary-eyed at the end as i was. i'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. so many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. "the graduate" "easy rider") now just seem silly and i don't want this to fall into the same category. but, i will find it and if it turns out silly, then at least i'll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. when we met, we went through this with "last tango in paris". the youngsters i work with (i'm 56) respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little "aged" now. i just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. "friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. it will bring back a lot of special feelings i'm sure. by all means, rent or buy a copy... indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today.

this film grabbed me right from its start, where a sweet-looking teen-aged girl is shown visiting a grave alone, then elton john's powerful song "friends" starts playing while she's shown walking alone through the streets of paris, carrying a suitcase, naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her. the entire film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of scenes of young love, holding hands, living in the country, wild horses running around freely, fields of wildflowers, sunsets, toasts of wine, evenings by the fireside, having fun, and general innocence, all set to romantic music by elton john. it's magical.somehow i missed seeing this film when i was growing up. i'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if i had seen it then. i remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971, talking about how it was a special movie with music by elton john, and with the chorus of the theme song "friends" playing in the ad ("makin' friends for the world to see..."), but i never heard anything else about it in those days, and never got to see it until i rented it 35 years later from a video store. by then it had been edited, censored, and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film. what can i say? the world has gone insane since then.the story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in paris after both her parents die. (it was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene.) one day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15-year-old boy, they hit it off, and agree to meet the next day. the next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident. it was his father's car, he can't bear to go back home to face his father's wrath, so the two teenagers begin living in the french countryside together, with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home. they settle into an unoccupied cottage, the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves, their supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl becomes pregnant, and they successfully have a baby at home. all the while the boy's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son. on the 1-year anniversary of the couple's flight together, the police finally locate the boy's employer by an in-person inquiry, and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. the next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work, saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend/wife, and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye. at least that's how the video version i saw ends. it's an unexpected though well-timed ending, presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered.as beautiful as the story and images are, the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived. i think it's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person's dream-come-true fantasy and to go no further in analysis, because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth. why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year? what did they plan to do when the owners returned? why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him? didn't they think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? how could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society? how could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around? where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free? how is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo? (the elton john song lyrics just don't fit.) why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it's about to get cold? and so on. the scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls, as is the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance," and all the back-washing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes, the running through flower fields towards each other, the haze filters, the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground, the baby ducks, and so on. it works, but it's definitely contrived.still, this is a movie about youth and freedom, and that ideal hasn't changed since the 1970s. young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world, and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom. therefore the message is universal. it's clear why a sequel wouldn't work: this story is about a magical, year-long reprieve from the real world. such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely, assuming that it could even happen in the first place, and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence. i really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt. but i hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the '70s learned something from it, and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others, instead of perpetuating society's various hatreds and repressions, especially on their own children.

great movie! the sound track is awesome! very relaxing sound. elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. the sound tracks written by sir elton complimented the movie to a t. rex morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "honey roll" and poem "i meant to do my work today" by richard le gallienne was incredible! kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film! it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field.

i haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and i have been searching for it since. at the time i was 12 and the story excited me; and now, the ending eludes me. it was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention john's vocals and taupin's lyrics. the story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. i am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run. if this movie didn't excite your curiosity, then you were just too old. i look forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! if nostalgia is in your venue, i'm sure this is an interesting movie to see. it's innocence is simply astounding and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.

my girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released. the controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. we were close to the same age as paul and michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. we were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. this movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have. i still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic (albiet syrupy) final scenes.

michelle, anicée alvina, was so nice, and i really fall in love with her. she died a few months ago! friends? really the best movie of my youth. the "seasons reprise" of elton and his arranger paul buckmaster sings in my head forever... please, if you know where i could find a vhs of the film, mail me!! my husband of 26 years & i saw this as juniors in hs. yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. i think we both cried our eyes out. i think possibly we were drawn to the movie by the elton john music in it, but were then swept away by the teenage angst of it all. paul and michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie- so very easy to identify with!! it is wonderful to hear that sean is doing well, i am also in the "helping professions" (an rn). i thought his performance was good and very believable. "michelle" came across as very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. i think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the "real world" then they could be happy and continue to be in love. how many times have all of us wanted to just have a "calgon moment". if we all had no outside worries and could just deal with our "basic needs" it could be somewhat easier. i have a 15 yr old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie.. kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame. for those of you who are trying to locate the cd my husband (a huge elton john fan) was able to get a 2-cd set which came out in 1992. it is called, "elton john-rare masters" polygram studios. this has all the friends songs as well as many others. as far as we know this is the only cd with the "friends" music. we also had the lp years ago and were thrilled to find the cd. good luck. i recommend this movie for anyone who loves the "young love" theme. i only wish it was on dvd now!!

i was in my mid teens when i saw this movie, and i was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. it amazes me to learn that alvina has recently died, that bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years, and that both would be in their 50s.the elton john soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion. i have seen the movie poster, billing it as "deux enfants quis'aiment," which apparently means something like "two children who like each other"--the english language distributors were wise to abbreviate the title!paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an english businessman living in paris, meets michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. the two take what they intend as a day-long holiday to michelle's late father's rural cottage, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. they fall in love, michelle gets pregnant, and they have the baby alone at home. after the baby's birth, the police come to paul's work place and take him away."blue lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise. so sad that "friends" has never been released on dvd.

well.....i wouldn't want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film. i saw it for the first time in 1976 (i was 14) and then one more time a year later. that was it. the rest of it was the pink lp of elton john's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. how deep? a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present. (no dvd's yet). boy....was i surprised!! poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty, love, god, idealist pursuits, stay with you forever. since they occur mostly at the heart's level (no intellect yet!), they define your soul's contours like a sculptor would do with a stone. if sometimes we didn't tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute, of every decision, of every turning point of our lives. so, i confess i feel nostalgia. but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again, and through this trip back in time, enriching that understanding of why we, people from the 60's, grew up as we did. the spirit of those times is all here: a genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success, make love not war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into "adults". i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as naïve and foolish. guys, be serious!! cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments. and this is exactly what "friends" does in a masterly way. it reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were 15. i'm now a musician and i feel some of us, artists for that matter, still dream about it!! how else could we live? that's "friends", that's "brother sun sister moon", that's "hair". those were the times, still alien to aids, alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody, to pornography presented as "sexuality", to this barbaric new "world order" growing after september 11th. what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. what a trip back to the very core of our hearts: to paris, to elton john at his best, to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 cv citroëns and the vw beetles. what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in camargue, surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. they made us who we are, as did serrat in spain, brel in france, peter paul and mary, joan baez, luther king, the beatles, the early bee gees, belafonte's spirituals, gandhi, the gospel of elvis. people still hoping: get this picture. start with innocence and grow from there. you'll find out what it's all about. and from there you'll have a solid and more truthful foundation; some ideals to look for in life, a way to handle personal and world affairs. we need so much of this today! give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end.

due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in italy, at least) i didn't expect much from this movie. thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house ("la casa maledetta" means "the cursed house"). well, i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different... this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller! very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot... ok, i've tried not to spoil the viewing of "7 hyden park" for you, which i'd highly recommend to everyone. p.s. am i wrong, or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand (she's paralyzed from the waist down) her feet and legs move a little too much? (... and i'm not talking of the "bad dream" sequence.)

the last film by underrated director alberto de martino ("the antichrist", "the killer is on the phone") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. there are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! what is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy? when the anonymous man, dressed up like a priest, assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs, it really sent cold shivers through my spine! years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair. she inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive-minded. she  joanna  falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away. naturally, he's only after her money and starts terrorizing joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her. the repeated images of a sinister looking priest, guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme, provide "formula for a murder" with a ton of genuine scares and alberto de martino's directing is very resolute. the acting is quite competent, with david warbeck ("the beyond", "the black cat") in a glorious greedy villain role. due some plot holes and a lack of originality, this movie might not be able to compete with italy's best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. many formerly obscure and unknown italian gialli received marvelous dvd-releases and, hopefully, "formula for a murder" will be given the same treatment really soon. in the meantime, good luck tracking this baby down!

a very suspenseful giallo from the director of "l'anticristo"(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.however the main story is about maniac(david warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.the plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.the score by francesco de massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in lucio fulci's "the new york ripper"(1982).highly recommended for fans of italian cinema!

a formula for murder isn't a well known giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! the film is directed by alberto de martino, the man behind cult classics such as the antichrist and blazing magnums. the film was released late on in the giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters. the film is, perhaps, not as exciting overall as many other films in the genre; but this is more than compensated for by the assured way that the central situation is fed to the audience, and the tension resulting from that. the plot begins by showing a fake priest raping a young girl named joanna, before pushing her down a flight of steps. we then fast forward several years and the girl is now a woman, who is unfortunately in a wheelchair. she is being trained for a sports event by craig; a man who also has romantic designs on her. however, his proposal isn't met with glee by joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic designs on her.the film features a plot twist half way through that makes up the backbone of the movie, and while it's not exactly logical; it's good to watch and hints that you're in for an interesting movie. director alberto de martino is clearly not afraid to show a few outrageous gore scenes, and the best of which in this film features a priest being battered to death by a spade - and i personally wouldn't hesitate to name that sequence as one of my favourite giallo murder scenes! the plot can be a little uneven at times, but generally the action is very good. the director spends what seems like an eternity on the conclusion to the film; but it's absolutely packed with tension, and the way that it plays out is good in that it takes advantage of all the plot points that have gone before it. the musical score, taken from fulci's the new york ripper, works well in this film also and, breaking a giallo tradition, de martino's film also features some rather good acting performances from cult veteran david warbeck and christina nagy, in her only feature film role. overall, this film isn't one of the easiest giallo's to come across; but its well worth tracking down and comes recommended to fans of this sort of film.

i admit to being in awe of the sea and have spent a number of years in the navy, so i am somewhat biased on this one. i missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on dvd this christmas (2002) and i got it! some of the film is amazing and i have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton blue whales 'cruising' through the sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. i like the level of information and facts conveyed through the narration, it is just right, i don't want to know a load of science just some of the basics, to see these things is enough for most people. the bbc has a knack of putting things at the right level for the intended audience.a really great documentary, up there with 'the world at war for' me, the dvd is of excellent quality. if i had a minor criticism it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there, i think they detract from some of the scenes. but well done to the bbc and discovery.

as a scuba diver, i can appreciate the incredible physical strain the cameramen must have endured to get the shots underwater. this series is much more than that, though. the narration is perfect, the scenes bordering on implausible and the subject matter enthralling. the day to day struggle for life taking place out of the view of we terrestrial dwellers is mind boggling. this dvd set has open my eyes to another planet right here on earth. i urge everyone to watch this series.

the bbc's blue planet is simply jaw-dropping. i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film. from familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths, next to nothing is left out. weighing in at a hefty 8 hours, some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film "deep blue" but i would heartily recommend you give the series a go. i don't think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by pixar's finding nemo i'm sure they will love this too. i just wish all television was this entertaining.

david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!the cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! but the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen. but, in contrast to this documentary gem, they make them pretty lame! but to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment!overall, this is the best tv series of 2001, with no competition, and, maybe, the best tv series of 2000s!

what i enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of corfu, being greek i adore my country and i liked the flattering director's point of view. based on a true story during the years when greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, nazis and hardship. an italian soldier and a greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. nicholas cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. i adored christian bale playing mandras the heroine's husband-to-be, he looks very very good as a greek, his personality matched the one of the greek patriot! a true fighter in there, or what! one of the movies i would like to buy and keep it in my collection...for ever!

this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. everything about the movie was perfect. i just saw the movie yesterday and i want to get my own dvd asap and watch it many times over. the story ends as it started i was very happy that he came back and i was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. she honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. the character had many shades. christian bale is also an phenomenal actor. some stories do have happy endings. aside from the love story angle i thought about how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people...government makes the decision whereas the people suffer. her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. i loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and i also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake. they were survivors.

i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a "10" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on "in love" and "loving."also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium. this is a "10" sci fi movie.do see this film. ignore the previous user's comments. one -- especially the ladies!! also do visit my website at my name as one word and a "dot" com.

captain corelli's mandolin is a beautiful film with a lovely cast including the wonderful nicolas cage, who as always is brilliant in the movie. the music in the film is really nice too. i'd advise anyone to go and see it. brilliant! 10/10

forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book. so what? this is a film after all. it is a sheer joy to watch, made entirely on location in cephallonia, gorgeous photography but with dark, disturbing moments as well. the only problem i have is with the obvious miscasting of nicolas cage as captain corelli. apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise.

once you can get over nic cage playing an italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love, not war, you can get down to enjoying this beautiful-looking film. this could be used as an advert for tourism in the mediterranean. john hurt is great and penelope cruz isn't bad, as you might expect. christian bale's character is somewhat one-dimensional, which is a shame.the main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book - having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots, i feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline.

"capt. corelli's mandolin" is an old fashioned hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity, and supposedly no americans. the story takes place on a greek island during ww2. the italians arrive to take over the island, but with german supervision. there is a romantic triangle made up of a greek couple and the italian captain. nice performances by all the actors; penelope cruz's best work yet.

this movie gives us some wwii history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. nicholas cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. and so do the other principle characters. one key charater, the physician/father played by john hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love i've ever heard. some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but i excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. my wife and i really liked the film. and it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy. one man who left the theatre near us said to his wife, "now that's the way to wage war!" i think you'll see what he means when you watch the italian occupiers of this lovely greek island.

these critics need to find a new job!!! this movie is based on a true story, which has made history. it illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. the breathtaking chephallonia of greece has captured my heart and soul as if i too were there. the blue eyed cage & the delightful cruz were amazing! together they perfectly portrayed how a mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. this movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!!!

just exactly how director john madden come to settle with nicolas cage and penelope cruz playing the roles of an italian officer and a greek villager in an honourable story: "captain correli´s mandolin", just escapes me! witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by cage amid horrendous over-acting, with cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled latino opposite johnny depp in "blow" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a greek nurse... ay, it was painful. but there were saving graces.the story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability. next, a superb performance by john hurt (cruz´s father, the village doctor) of oscar callibre, as well as by irene papas, each as village elders, as well as by christian bale (papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by cruz and cage. nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it´s teeth-gnashing early on. finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed. john hurt already has two oscar nominations and this would be a third; i hope he gets it as his performance as the doctor makes this film worth seeing. the true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close.entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar. see it if you haven´t. rating = 3.5 stars (of five).

a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. i think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. one thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'mandras' and pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot. irene papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, living in a island during the 40's, who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. john hurt, pelagia's father, also acted great. he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions.

captain corelli's mandolin is no oscar contender but it was pretty good. i have to admit ms cruz can really act. she puts on a very good performance. in fact she our does her boyfriend tom in drama. john hurt was great as usual. nicholas cage seemed to be enjoying himself. i bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an italian. however, i did learn something. one more chapter in horrors of nazi germany the many italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and germany's eventual surrender.

i really enjoyed this movie. during the movie, i felt that i wanted pelagia and captain corelli to get together. i heard myself screaming: come on, kiss her! the movie has a happy ending. good movie to watch in the evening when you want to chill.

captain corelli's mandolin is one of nicolas cage's better films. he turns a fine performance as the title character. this is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. john hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by penelope cruz, some honest advice about love. this movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. this movie also allows cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it. again, nicolas cage did not disappoint.

to say the truth, i went to see this movie only because nicolas cage is my favorite actor. folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. i haven't seen a movie with penelope crus before, so i was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. so, here's what i think:the movie is good (i haven't read the novel, however). some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple. so the only thing that could save the movie, which (an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning) would either end tragically or happily, was the performance of both cage and crus. and it was great, great, great!!! in the latter part of the movie i even liked a rather broad accent of the actress (spanish, but for those who don't speak greek that's ok, and she even looks like a greek girl). overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony (fans of classical music will surely have fun at some moments:)i give it 9/10. you should see it!

warning: if the coen brothers or david lynch define your taste in film, disregard this review and move on.yes, i borrowed the "one line summary" from the book about president ronald reagan, but, among other virtues, this movie emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings. this film is full of honest, decent people, and they have integrity to spare. in a word, they have "character."a small nitpick: unless you know the history of ww ii, you probably don't know that, from captain correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of mussolini, 3 and one-half years have passed. the average viewer might think the romance was of the "whirlwind" variety. that is not so. the romance develops slowly, which gives it both dignity and meaning. the film's deliberate pace may be the director's way of marking time.some reviews have criticized cage's italian accent. the italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good. the history was right on the mark. yes, the germans turned against their italian allies, who, for the most part, were reluctant allies from the start. if you find that shocking, keep in mind that the french mediterranean fleet was blown up by the british in 1940, just after france's capitulation, lest it fall in the hands of the vichy government, or worse, the nazis.the depiction of the italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization.this film was beautifully photographed, and its story was lyrical. the script was not thought-provoking, nor was it clever, but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed, nor would they have been appropriate. the story is tender, and the message is uplifting. the characters are honest, brave, earnest, sympathetic, and likeable. it's a nice little film. 8/10. 

in my opinion, this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography. too bad the story is not all that good and mr. cage sometimes loses his accent. but two thumbs up for lighting and the dp!

'captain corelli's mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. it is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. the views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! nicolas cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. i think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. louis de bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon. go and see this film with an open mind-you'll love it; because underneath is the touching story of love and war.

here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. the portraying of the italian and german occupancy of greek island kefalonia is well-done. john hurt as pelagia's father and the island doctor is superb, nicolas cage does a good job as the captain from the title, penelope cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at cage. there's heroics and humor, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island.oddly enough, a very similar, or should i say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by louis de bernieres. this wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful pelagia, daughter of doctor iannis, and their life on kefalonia during wwii. pelagia's fiancee, local fisherman mandras, enlists when the italian army invades northern greece from albania under false pretenses. when the axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the germans, a garrison of italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and captain corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. as mandras joins the partisans, charming corelli and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. of course, this makes it a novel about love. but it is also a war novel, a summary of greek history, a tale of communist uprising in post-war greece, a portrait of the madness of mussolini, and, most importantly, an ode to island life on kefalonia.some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. i am glad nobody ever tried.the movie 'captain corelli's mandolin', however, is worth seeing. just make sure you read the book *after* you see the movie.

once again john madden has given us a magnificent film. a simple but beautiful story located in a real paradise and the music can't be better, stephen warbeck delights us once more, and good actings but.........why on earth is penelope cruz in this film? i asked myself that same question while watching this movie. of course her greek accent is not believable, she's uncapable of acting decently not even in one scene. not even at the end she did a good job, after so many events, after years she finally gets to see corelli again and she couldn't change the same face of stupidy we had to bear during the whole film. anyway, cage was very good in one of his best characters; hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching. this is a beautiful film that not even mrs. cruz was able to spoil. so far i think it's madden best work so no fan will be disappointed.

a beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so-called reasons. the performance of cage and cruz were quite impressive, but it is to the older greek characters that go the highest praises. irene papas is as gorgeous as ever! though some scenes seems a little long at times, this film will be a heavy oscar contender.

at first i didn't think i would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. i love music and i was impressed with how well cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. my son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how corelli won the girls heart. the acting and the story were both well done and well directed. at first corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. the twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the germans. i would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. i also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again.

after a somewhat slow start i thought this movie about the italian occupation of a greek island during world war ii picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. the love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because i know it happened in various places under occupation. penelope cruz played pelagia, a young greek girl engaged to be married to mandras (christian bale). i had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when italy invaded greece, and mandras went off to fight. after german intervention, greece is conquered and the island pelagia lives on comes under italian occupation, during which pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with captain corelli (nicholas cage.) this, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. as they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. i just finished reading an interesting book about the german occupation of britain's channel islands in which this was a major issue. once mandras returns to the island, pelagia is torn between them.the second background issue is the italian occupation itself, which i thought was quite realistically portrayed. first was the contempt with which the island treated their italian occupiers. greece defeated italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the germans. the refusal of the town to surrender to the italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a german officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. i loved the line, "we would rather surrender to this german's dog than to you italians.") the portrayal of the italian troops also struck me as believable. the italian army was never enamoured of their german ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. although hitler and mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. here, the italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the german troops on the island simply can't understand,) and are ecstatic when italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the germans. it was all quite well done, i thought.it falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise.7/10

i have to admit that i approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. louis de berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. all the way through i found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. the ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and i could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. still, the plusses (john toll's magnificent cinematography, stephen warbeck's great score, etc) i felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script).but, two days later, i was queuing again to see corelli, and although not perfect, i have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of penelope cruz and john hurt perfectly. david morrissey is quietly effective as weber, the nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. and the fine greco-italian supporting cast bring de berniere's sundrenched world of cepholonia dazzlingly alive.on leaving the cinema second time around, i finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of ww2 cepholonia in cinematic terms. my hat goes off to john madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the british critics (any director who has had a major success like shakespeare in love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!),has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now.if you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious mediterranean atmosphere, and discover corelli, pelagia, mandras, dr iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay), and i guarantee you won't be disappointed. in fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or dvd.8/10

being of cephallonian descent, i was happily surprised when watching the movie. i have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. it is all true, the italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. the earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. if you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of italians in love with cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of cephallonian women were taken to italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history.

as is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost. here director john madden (shakespeare in love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. the cinematography by john toll (cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall, winning oscars for both) is splendid. working with madden, the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous.madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film. there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. however, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. while the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. by the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features.nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. when fight he must, cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.penelope cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as pelagia. in part this is because cage so dominates the screen, but cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. she allows the character to be objectified as corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine. however, christian bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as pelagia's fiancé.i rated this film an 8/10. despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing. the photography alone is worth the price of admission.

obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious "mandingo," this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint: the evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves. director mario penzauti and screenwriter tecla romanelli cram this fetid filth with a teeming surplus of sizzling sleaze: we've got nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross), copious female nudity, brutal whippings, vile degradation, lots of lurid soft-core sex, and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest, murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid inhumanity of slavery. special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actress paola d'egidio, whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of depraved and lascivious wicked bitch rhonda positively burns up the screen. moreover, marcello giombini's funky, throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot. maurizo centini's fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick. a satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill.

incredibly hilarious mid-70's italian rootsploitation with lots of non-consensual s&m, lesbian sex, gratuitous racial cruelty etc...few redeeming cinematic qualities, except for the fairly cool theme music with dubby "african" drums and flute. brilliant sample dialog: white slave owner (to white plantation manager): "you're so dumb, i'll bet you forgot to interrogate that n****r midwife!"white plantation manager: "not only did i interrogate her, i did it so well she died before i could get any answers from her!"all the black actors have 70's afros, and say "yes, massa" in a high-pitched voice. the female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze.

spike milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'puckoon' is sadly no exception. the novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'puckoon' of the title ). due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in northern ireland, the other half is in the republic. locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. a dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him.'puckoon' is a sort of irish 'under milk wood' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore. the lead character, dan milligan ( renamed 'madigan' in the film ) is impishly played by sean hughes, and has conversations with the narrator ( richard attenborough ). also in the film is milo o'shea, griff rhys jones, david kelly ( from 'robin's nest' ), freddie jones, joe mcgann, and elliott gould.interviewed for the 'making of 'puckoon' documentary, writer/director terence ryan expressed undying admiration for the book. it shows on screen. but, alas, like the ill-fated film of 'the hitch-hiker's guide to the galaxy', a good book does not necessarily make a good film. the trouble with 'puckoon' is that, like milligan's other books, they simply do not work on the big screen. 'puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot.no way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'sex lives of the potato men', 'fat slags', and 'lesbian vampire killers', but then neither is it as good as it should have been. the last half-hour involves a lot of running around by the police, the british army, some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin, and is really tedious to sit through. ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film.the other problem is the total absence of charm. 'waking ned' had this in spades, while the 'father ted' television series was funnier by far. spike lived long enough to see the film, and apparently enjoyed it. his daughter, jane, has a cameo as madigan's bride.the highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning: "i don't mind dying!", said spike: "i just don't want to be there when it happens!".

saw the film at the closing gala of the ealing film festival in west london(england). enjoyed it immensely. although the crow & the chinese policeman don't appear, and dan milligan becomes dan madigan (played by sean hughes (i)). the interaction between dan and the author (writer/director) voiced/played by lord richard attenborough, works very well.the rumour is that lord attenborough and elliott gould (as dr. goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.

i hope, from his seat on heaven's comedic throne, spike milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as terence ryan and ken tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it "nearly turned me mad" into a joy to watch.the film tells the story of the irish town of puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between northern ireland and the republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard. this causes some deceased, buried in the catholic churchyard, to now be in the protestant north - and so the local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals, aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness, and so avoiding the bureaucratic british border guards.it was inspired work to cast the irish comedian and poet sean hughes to play the part of madigan. he brings an innocence to the part, especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of richard attenborough, playing supposedly the writer/director of the film). daragh o'malley playing father rudden is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from the household names like elliott gould and griff rhys jones to people with what would normally be called 'bit parts' - such as spike's daughter jane who plays madigan's wife give 100% the credit for this goes, in no small part, to the wonderful characterisations given by spike in the original book.i could argue that the film is slightly too long, or that elliott gould's irish accent left a little to be desired, but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film.

if you've never experienced the thing that is zasu pitts, here is a zasu zinger! in 1933 mae questel caricatured pitt's voice for the character olive oyl for the fleischer studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip popeye. zasu (pronounced zay-sue) does her best "olive oyl" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. i kept waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead it's "something always happens to somebody." the first time i saw this film i loved zasu and found her character really funny. i've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining, uptight, fragile-flower routine. so, upon watching this film again i started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust. but, there are some funny comedy bits here, and it's also a mystery movie as well. it's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. the mystery plot holds together well through the camp of zasu pitts and james gleason who plays arthur crimmer the policeman. the haunted house is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the attic! well worth the watch. read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/

1930's comedy mystery about "the crooked circle" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by zazu pitts and james gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of hildegarde withers films after edna mae oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (i don't hence the lack naming). a breezy hour long romp, the movie doesn't make a great deal of sense with mistaken identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people not being who they seem. its the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night viewing when one is nostalgic for the late late show.

the "old dark house" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.the crooked circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on col. walters (berton churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. they decide he must die that very night. meanwhile the colonel's own group, the sphinx club, is determined to protect him at all costs. this does not sit well with thelma (irene purcell) fiancée of club member brand osborne (ben lyon, late of the mega-budgeted hell's angels (1930)) who wants him to quit the club and stop endangering his own life. brand promises to resign after saving the colonel's life. everyone heads off to walters newly purchased mansion on long island to await the assassin.the colonel might be the new owner of melody manor but it's an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbours (like raymond hatton as a local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. top billed zasu pitts is nora, the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit around every corner. throw in a cop (james gleason) who is certain brand is a criminal and we have a picture which is packed with action and surprises.you will notice right away that the script writer was at a loss to come up with too much dialog because a lot of characters repeat the same lines over and over. yoganda (c. henry gordon) a hindu mystic (which movies of that time were loaded with) says "evil is on the way." many times and i lost count of how often ms. pitts says "something always happens to somebody!". there are many suspects and two characters (mr. gleason as the stereotype dumb cop and roscoe karns as mr. lyon's pal) who serve as comedy relief. the house itself is appropriately spooky looking (in fact i think the same set was used in the phantom (1931)) with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms but somehow you never really get a feeling of danger. maybe it's because no one in the movie, and i do mean no one!, is entirely what they seem to be. it all comes out right in the end though; but to go into any more detail would spoil it for you.watch carefully for robert frazer (from white zombie) and frank reicher (best remembered as capt. engelhorn from king kong) to pop up among the suspects.the crooked circle is a fun film. some aspects of the plot are predictable and then again several others are not. i suspect you will enjoy it.

i really enjoyed this movie about a dog who becomes a duke. it would have been very easy to mess this one up, but along with the humor, the script was filled with warmth and even some profundity about nobility and class. it's a feel good movie that the whole family can watch.. even the adults!

it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. sophie heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to sophie and she got a copy from her. if someone is reading this i suggest buy the movie and i guaranteed it won't be a bad decision. i've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance.

the duke is a very silly film--a dog becoming a duke! but it's a very fun movie. it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have, but (thankfully!) no bodily function jokes, as so many animal movies feel compelled to have! mostly, it's just dogs being dogs and people being. . . well, people. the 'good guys' are likeable and appealing. the 'bad guys' are ridiculous, and of course, the pun of many jokes. but there is something dignified about this movie, for even though it is silly, it's not out for every cheap laugh like "home alone" and others.crocket, simon and copper do an excellent job playing black and tan coonhound "hubert" who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a real duke, dies. for the most part, they just act like dogs, no 'talking,' or human-like emotions and attitudes. however, they do stereotype poodles, and hubert does fall for her, just because she's a poodle. come on! these are dogs--they have a different view of beauty!!!overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.

let's be fair: there are no rules for scriptwriting, so i won't say the movie should be something other than it is. i'll just state my opinion. ok, i really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. however, i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. since this movie was directed by joão falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical. it's the man's first movie, for cryin' out-loud! what i'm saying is, there are parts in the film - like the city of nordestina, which slightly resembles the set of "hoje é dia de maria" - that feel like we're not at a movie theater. we're at the theater! lines are spoken too formally, characters are moving choreographically, and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage. sure, maybe that was the intention, but that's been done. on stage. wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie - the beautiful "closer", for instance. when i went to see this one, though, i didn't feel like i was watching a movie. but overall, it was a good one, worth watching. it's a nice love story, funny at times and sad at others. my vote is a 7.

very touching film, a great surprise to come up from brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... magical realism is a very hard task, and i believe joão falcão has made it wonderfully. it seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. another mistake is to think that falcão has been influenced by the series "hoje é dia de maria". the tv series produced by globo was made after the film, but aired before... unfortunately.the negative point is the photography, by walter carvalho. it seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept falcão has created. the story is captivating and universal, in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in brazil. that could take place anywhere in the world. a great movie, i strongly recommend.

years ago i read the book 'a máquina' (the machine). as i re-read this little book again and again, i could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the brazilian culture.when i knew about the movie, i was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.i can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text. also i can't recall such a powerful performance like gustavo falcão's.you can see and feel how colossal his love for karina is. you can realize that he'll move mountains and do anything for this love.do see this movie, watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you, enchant yourself!

i rented this movie, but i wasn't too sure what to expect of it. i was very glad to find that it's about the best brazilian movie i've ever seen. the story is rather odd and simple, and above all, extremely original. we have antonio, who is a young man living in nordestina, a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of brazil, and who is deeply in love with karina. the main conflict between the two is that, while antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it, karina wants to see the world and resents the place. as a prove of his love for her, he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her. he'll put nordestina in the map, as he says. and the way he does it is unbelievable. this is a good movie; might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job, but i think that it's also that that improves the story. it's just fun, and it makes you feel good.

in nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in pernambuco, antônio (gustavo falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. when he is a young man, he falls in love for karina (mariana ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. antônio promises karina to bring the world to nordestina, and once in rio de janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. fifty years later, antônio (paulo autran) tries to fix what was wrong in his travel."a máquina" is one of the best brazilian movies i have recently seen. the refreshing and original story is a poetic and magic fable of love that will certainly thrill the most skeptical and tough viewer, in a unique romance. the direction is excellent; the screenplay is awesome; the cinematography and colors are magnificent; the cast leaded by gustavo falcão, the icon paulo autran and mariana ximenes is fantastic, with marvelous lines; the soundtrack has some beautiful brazilian songs highlighting geraldo azevedo and rento rocha's "dia branco". if this movie is distributed overseas, please thrust me and rent it or buy the dvd because i bet you will love the story that will bring you into tears. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "a máquina  o combustível é o amor" ("the machine  the fuel is love")

well this was the wwf's last pay per view event of the millennium and it ended the year and millennium right. the huge story line of stephanie and hhh started right here at this event when steph turned on her dad. vince mcmahon had a great match with hhh and this event is very good i give it a 9

the subject of this movie is disturbing. how could some otherwise intelligent, religious, hard-working, and sincere white afrikaaners treat the native blacks so cruelly for so long?the movie answers this question, and also explains how some afrikaaners are changing in a positive way.

final solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. it shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. jan ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. he was raised to be that way. then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, pastor lekota. will he change his ways?. the film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy. the movie shows the world of how apartheid affected the psyche of blacks and whites.this is a great film that everyone should watch.

i know gerrit. he presently lives in the u.s. this film is based on events in the lives of both gerrit and celeste wolfaardt. it's a remarkable story. it inspired me to read "cry, beloved country." the film is well-produced. the music is beautiful.the story is told in flashbacks. you learn the stories of a white racist south african (gerrit) and a black south african (moses). their lives intersect violently. the ending is not typical hollywood -- it's unusually realistic and ends on a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes.be sure to watch through the credits -- you'll get to see footage of gerrit in real life.

this movie, based on a true story of gerrit wolfaardt, is one of the best films i've seen on race relations in south africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's south africa. i put it in on the scale of american history x as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the aryan doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.it's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today. the violence is well done as to show the severity of gerrit's crimes and greatness of his transformation.one word about jan ellis who played gerrit wolfaardt. he carries you through the darkness of gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. he went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended on his performance.another standout performance was that of mpho lovinga who plays moses moremi, one victim of gerrit's crimes. he was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance.very good movie to show the teens.

if you are looking for a phony hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. if the truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. from a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in south africa (and many other places).for historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as "the pianist," "schindler's list" or "nuremberg." millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. this movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper.

the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo, regardless of the age of the oav. the plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.this might sound picky, but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would you feel comfortable there as a human? would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? i doubt it. there are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters. seems sloppy to me.the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, though no light is shed on this. little light is shed on the backstory at all, a great pity. the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we don't see any character depth. the groundwork's all down, yet we're left with no finished product. a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode, once some character sub-plots had been established.the highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action/espionage.the flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to digest all the goings-on, so i couldn't recommend this for owning, but it's certainly worth a watch or two! whilst this review is mostly negative, i really do think it's worth your time to watch this, but it's not something to rush out and buy. in a nutshell: a watchable wasted opportunity.

based on the manga (comic) of well-known artist masamune shirow, this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me.the story is good, but the animation is merely "ok" while it could/should have been mindblowing. the movie is imo adequate, but seems somehow flat & uninspired, if you know what i mean. a wasted opportunity, if you consider that another work by shirow, "ghost in the shell", is considered a classic in many respects. it set new standards for japanese animation, and spawned, among other things, a brilliant series called "gits: stand alone complex".i consider this worth a rental, unless you're a fan of shirow and want it all. do check out the original manga, which comes highly recommended.

pretty decent for his early work and no kokaku kidotai without it, and gets an 2 points extra for the easter eggs. for shirow definitely a rung in the ladder. i am biased as a shirow fan but this was a big step from dirty pair which was what i knew of him. violent fun with a porno soundtrack! you cannot help but notice that. i know people appreciate him for ghost in the shell..but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in appleseed. eswat killing terrorists, the struggle for humans to stay viable as bioroids phase them out, and deunan staying thin despite her intake of junk food. definitely like the characters even the traitor..and i do not know why.

as i have said before, i am not a fan of tweety. he's just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers. the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. if only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating canary forever. but, as cartoons starring tweety go, this one is quite good, but it's all thanks to that brilliant cat.

funny, yes. a freleng classic! to watch sylvester turn green is always a treat, and it brings us back to the days when cartoon slapstick was brave and geared for the adult mind.loved it!

in tweety's s.o.s, sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and granny, his owner. uh-oh! once again, tweety and granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. and the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. so now sylvester can blow fire! i'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by friz freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo. tweety's s.o.s is most highly recommended.

i thought that the storyline came into place very well. i liked this movie a lot. if you're going to rag on a bridget fonda movie, you can just rot. i thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. apparently somebody doesn't think so. i rather enjoyed the movie. i'm even thinking of buying it. i want it to be my very first dvd for my room. that's how much i like it. i rather would not start an online argument with someone i don't know & have it be over a movie. if someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline, i would be more than happy to retract my insult. however, if they feel that i am not worthy of a retraction, i might just feel that they are not worthy of one either. but i can't control their actions, i can only encourage them in the right direction. hey, they don't have to make a retraction, but i would greatly appreciate it.

the snowqueen is one of the best love stories i have ever seen: much better and deeper than luhrman's romeo&juliet or spielberg's titanic. gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. this story encourages me to fight like gerda for the only one, for the love of my life, for mister right. patience is one of the keywords of this movie. i cry every time when i realize all the suffering of gerda and kay. and i wish that it ends soon... snowqueen tells although my life, i deeply identify with the story and the characters. thanks at least for hans christian anderson and the director.

"snow queen" is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) andersen's fairy tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one retains the spirit of faerie, an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many, especially among americans. talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons, and demons, are not to be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story. nor is the story bound by modern hollywood rules of composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least).with this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales, "snow queen" is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting, and great sentiment. the only flaw in the movie was, i think, not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.

this is a video version of a stage production, with extra shooting for the video edition. the result gains both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film. the set by george tsypin, with sculptures and masks by julie taymor are superb.jessye norman is terrific, and one gets to hear (and see) the young bryn terfel. this production is stunning, emotional and majestic. if you don't see this you have missed out.

i wish i could have met ida lupino. when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner, well, for me one person would be her. i think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry. her life story would make a great tele movie (hey, mr bogdanovich........). ida lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. i can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly aip film is the late 70s. she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. ugh. i should have contacted her then as she died not long after.. more from the part than the worm too. from high sierra, roadhouse and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground, ida lupino was often the producer and the lead actress. later, with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today. one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a monogram pictures copyright. monogram changed the company name formally to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits. this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the innocents and the haunting made 8 years later. really chilling and very creepy, this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film ida lupino made and was responsible for. try and find it...you will always remember it and as i feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress/producer.

i first caught up with jennifer years ago while out of town when it showed up on tv in the middle of the night; i fell asleep before it ended but it stuck with me until i had to track it down. its appeal is that, though there's not a lot to it, it weaves an intriguing atmosphere, and because ida lupino and howard duff (real life man-and-wife at the time) display an alluring, low-key chemistry. lupino plays a woman engaged to house-sit a vast california estate whose previous caretaker -- jennifer -- up and disappeared. (shades of jack nicholson in the shining, although in this instance it's not lupino who goes, or went, mad). duff is the guy in town who manages the estate's finances and takes a shine to lupino, who decides to play hard to get. she becomes more and more involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending stairways and locked cellars. the atmospherics and the romantic byplay are by far the best part of the movie, as viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit of a letdown -- there's just not that much to it (except a little frisson at the tail end that anticipates brian de palma's filmic codas). but it's well done, and, again, it sticks with you. extra added attraction: this is the film that introduced the song "angel eyes," which would become part of the standard repertoire of ol' blue eyes.

the movie jennifer with ida lupino and howard duff is film noir magnificence.this is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see.jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time, which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times. i love the stark black and white film noir movies.film noir in color is not as good.the cast and script is excellent.the rather creepy music is fun to listen to.ida lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screen.i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like.she was not only breathtakingly beautiful,she was a fine actress.the first movie that i remember seeing ida lupino in was roadhouse with richard widmark and cornel wilde.i never forgot the movie,or her. i saw her last films like food of the gods and women in chains, and even though the movies were not her usual fare, she was still delightful in them as an actress.howard duff is always terrific to watch.i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone.i have this movie on vhs tape.

rating: 7 out of 10. directed by barbet schroeder. if you like hitchcock's `rope', then you will like this movie. `murder by numbers' stars sandra bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie mayweather. her partner is sam kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by ben chaplin. the teenage killers are high school students richard haywood (ryan gosling) and justin pendleton (michael pitt). these young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.the supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. the movie reminds me of various `hitchcock' movies crossed with the tv show `law and order'. we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.the other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story.`murder by numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should i say dangerous, murder mystery. for more thrills and suspense, try `se7en' or hitchcock's `dial m for murder'.

sandra bullock paints a believable picture as the troubled detective, though seeing her as a cynical man-eating victim-turned-persecutor requires a leap of faith (or two). the two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by ryan gosling and michael pitt. i do have quite a bit of trouble getting ben chaplin into the equation (same problem arose when watching 'the truth about cats & dogs' (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/). i mean, when you put an englishman into an all-american movie, shouldn't there at least be a reason to put him there? shouldn't there be some story leading up to the fact that an englishman is serving as a detective on an american police force? shouldn't there be some dialog pointing out and explaining that rather obvious fact? or even some jokes about him being that english? he looks out of place here, as he looked out of place in 'the truth about cats & dogs'. producers really should take notice, it distracts and annoys the audience (at least me). nothing wrong with chaplin's acting, it's just a matter of making an actor who is 'out of place' believable and not putting him somewhere without a good reason or a storyline. the movie itself: well, thrillers, especially those dealing with solving a complicated crime, require some suspension of disbelief. this one's no different; actually, it requires quite a bit more effort than usual. in order to make bullock smart enough to crack the case despite of all the pressures requiring her to let go of it, some unrealistic assumptions are being made about the evidence, and i'm sure a lot of people who watched it had a few moments of 'come on, this is highly unlikely under the circumstances' or even 'hey, you can't brush evidence aside like that to wrap this movie up!'. like i said: reasonably entertaining and watchable. just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams. there are no shortcuts there.

i find it hard to believe this could happen at all. we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past. the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. so the first crime they commit is murder? just to play and jostle with the cops? how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it? also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle. hmmm. this whole concept is really hard to believe. that said let's move on. i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then. as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive. the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess. sandra does a superb acting job. she sure made me believe she was one angry cop. as for solving the crime, i thought it was great. this movie kept me planted in my chair. loved the acting of all but sam. he had no get-up and go. the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene.

sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. this movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first few times a movie i could not watch to completion. it was too real....and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle. seeing these three men and their families deal with their hardships, one in particular, often hit me too hard. now, i have watched in its entirety without interruption several times, and i realize what i always suspected. this movie is a masterpiece. the writing, the acting, the blending of several stories without being even the least bit choppy, everything about this movie is exceptional. seven academy awards? no wonder, it certainly must have deserved them.

blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals, and unconditional surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation, this was the summon substance of the united states victory in world war ii!! the celebration on times square as well as everywhere else in the united states suggests a national zenith!!! america is on top right!! one thing, one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing..the period of adjustment!!..the actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished..now everyone needs to get on with their lives...only one problem though...they have to get new lives...the old lives are gone forever...polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!! everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!! once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other americans touched by world war ii, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of world war ii and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!! for now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...frederick march and myrna loy had to start over!! dana andrews realized that he should never have been married to virginia mayo in the first place!!! theresa wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!! las but not least, the character, homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!!the reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way, once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new united states and the new world overall, tragedy from wwii was recognized, and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride, and dealt with accordingly!! frederick march and myrna loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage, homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him (i.e. half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and thresa wright's involvement with dana andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...this is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the indianapolis 500...the characters in the movie are the typical post wwii americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their lives...happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice!!...world war ii did not just happen!! it will henceforth dominate the social patterns of american living!!!the aggregate catastrophe of world war ii has mirrored most americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well!!i loved this film and so did afi, probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo!!..bottom line, see this movie!! nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and/or readjustment, coping with your life when stricken-ed by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today, however!! this is 1946!! very new to americans then....remember that!! director william wyler has illustrated how americans feel about the aftermath of wwii in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back!!! take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was!!

thirty years prior to the deer hunter came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the american family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. a truly ironic title, the best years of our lives is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of myrna loy, the best years of our lives focuses more on the stories of the men. al stephenson (fredric march) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife milly (myrna loy). fred derry, upon returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to marie, a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. homer parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.at almost three hours of length, the film never seems long and drawn out. there is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of dana andrews as fred derry, harold russell as homer parrish and virginia mayo as marie derry. even then every character has his or her moment on film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in american films (including the ones made around world war one, which did not dabble in such topics). while there is never any overt violence, it's all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male leads' faces, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse, to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. this is the film in which coming home and born on the fourth of july are indebted to. at a time when america fled from war films, to come up with this when the end of the second world war was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film-making.

one of the great things about the best years of our lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post world war ii era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on v-e or v-j day of 1945. the problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.and while we don't often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the united states of america did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous world war. the gi bill of rights is mentioned in passing in the best years of our lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. so many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like fredric march, dana andrews, and harold russell who you see here.all three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the usa could identify with. they all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, boone city, iowa.war is a great leveler of class and distinction. bank employee march, soda jerk andrews, and high school football star russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like boone city. but they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.march is the oldest, a man with two children and hollywood's perfect wife myrna loy. he settles in the first and the best. he has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.i also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. watch march's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. you can feel him read the man's soul. it's what got him his second best actor oscar for this film.harold russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the pacific. he got a special recognition oscar for his performance. because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the supporting actor category which he also won in. his performance, especially his scenes with cathy o'donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.dana andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the army air corps. of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. he also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. that uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got virginia mayo interested enough to marry him. the problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.while mayo is fooling around with steve cochran, andrews has the great good fortune to have march's daughter teresa wright take an interest in him. they're the main story of the film, andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. not all veteran's problems were solved with gi bill.myrna loy gets little recognition for the best years of our lives. my guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at mgm. still as wife to march and mother to wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.the best years of our lives won for best picture for sam goldwyn, best director for william wyler and a few others besides the two acting oscars it got. it was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film sam goldwyn ever produced. it remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. it's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.the best tribute this film received came from frank capra who had a film of his own in the oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. in his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague william wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.by the way, the film capra had hopes for was it's a wonderful life. the beat years of our lives can't get better praise than that.

well as you can see, i got to this party quite late but, have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. i found this site by happen chance, when i was looking for other marine corps films. so, let me start by telling you that i played a marine boot in the movie, pvt. labarsky, and was stationed at mcrdep, san diego at the time. jack webb and his crew selected 15 permanent personnel, of which some of us had the speaking parts, and another 15 marines that had just completed boot camp. that made up the platoon and the marines who portrayed the various "dis". to the best of my recollection, the capt. and pvt. owens (don dubbins) were not in the marines. we spent about three weeks up in hollywood (studio city film lot), ca shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with, and then they completed the other shots after we left.so as i ramble along here, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous entries as best i can. "cuff daddy" was commenting about the ability of our platoon to yell "yes sir" without moving and etc,, yes we did the yelling for the sound guys, and it was while shooting the scene. as you fellow marines remember, when the di or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it, you had already taken your breath of air enabling you to yell at the top of your lungs the proper response. that is how it was done."74sooner" commented about walking through the same building at paris island, however, as i mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in studio city, ca . they were built from photos taken at paris island and from on site trips and marine advisers from paris island. sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets."schappe1" brought up many good points, but, about the incident with the platoon at paris island at the time all that jack webb said to us was, "the movie came about because of the accident, and the marine corps didn't want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the marines that died that night. although, the marine corps would provide any marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a marine di does what he does".as mentioned by a few of you, i also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been cleaned up to much and obviously isn't how it goes down in real life. back in the 50's,that is how it had to be done.one story i would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us marines and the movie crew, and between the movie crew and jack webb. from the start by custom the marines replied "yes sir" to anybody that moved. going into the second week it was getting more common to hear "yes sir" coming from all directions. on stage someone would bark out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a catwalk above the set a reply of "yes sir" would sound out. to all of this at one of our informal gatherings, jack webb stated. "if i had known that i would have gotten this much respect from this crew, i would have brought you guys up here years ago." there was a lt. brought up from san diego to play the role of the di from the other platoon and the one jack webb fights with, but during one shooting secessions he was up to take number 32, and still webb kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didn't show any lack of patience with him. the next day they used the paris island adviser who was a di sgt. from paris island and he worked out fine.at the time i was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the still camera man to get some pointer from him and as it turned out he would give me still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used. those film strips i cut up and made slides out of them. after the movie came out in vhs tape (the di, 11706 b&w/106 min.) my kids and the grand kids have a blast when they try to se who can find me the most times on the screen.

i was a marine at camp pendleton when the d.i. came out (1st marine division, 11th marine regiment, 3rd battalion, i-battery). i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the "star" theater in oceanside, california.we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea (i believe they were all real drill instructors too). as good an actor as jack webb was, he just couldn't "call cadence" like a real marine drill instructor.all of us got a laugh when the "problem" recruit's mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain. never in a million years would this have happened, but that's hollywood, and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie.i went through boot camp at mcrd in san diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d.i.'s could do to you. the "ribbon creek" event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at mcrd - san diego.i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt. moore's "stiffness" around his girl friend. i believe this was just webb's acting style, and although they could have deleted this part of the movie, it didn't really hurt the production that much.one minor note, the character (uncredited) of "pvt. rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, sgt. peter j. o'neill. sgt. o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor. we secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. he was a great drill instructor, and i thought he did well in his bit part. also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. i have often wondered if he is still alive.

the d.i. (4 outta 5 stars) wow, i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did. i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day. i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d.i.s as portrayed in "full metal jacket" or "an officer and a gentleman". boy, was i wrong. this is probably the best work webb has ever done... far and away better than his one-note "dragnet" performances. the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant... done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you *know* that the guy means every word of it. the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling. even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song "if'n you don't, somebody else will"? webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever... and he's under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but, by golly, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming! great stuff!

i had the good fortune to be at perris island in the fall of 1959. the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks, plt 162, b co, 1st bn, 1st itr.although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie, we could hear those that were laughing. it's one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pi.at some later date, i got to actually see it in a theater. i'm still convinced that, to date, it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done. no one has done it better than jack webb...

jack webb is riveting as a marine corp drill instructor in the d.i.. webb play sgt.jim moore, a tough but fair marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat. no one could have played this role any better that jack webb. as a former marine,i can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the corp. extremely entertaining!

of course i'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen.i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. it took about two or three days as best i can recall.webb and don dubbins were serious and businesslike.during the filming of our short scene--which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old--webb was very conscientious about getting things (marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception--that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses. never happen for a host of reasons.i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force (no brag, just fact).what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles. that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done. the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language. when the di was made, cursing wasn't allowed on screen. despite the lack of profanity, it's still a great movie to rent.ooooo-rahhhhhh!!!!!semper fi, do or die

it is always a well-known, and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes. in the crucial opening scenes, the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film. here, in "mute witness", we find a prime example of this.*scene spoiler* in the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens to a very hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. she's wandering around, applying lipstick, dolling herself up, and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose. of course, the serial killer is in her house, and monitoring her moves, knife in hand. she hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. at the very point of her screams, she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act.......then something odd happens. as the woman convulses in her death throes, the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish. before he finds his lighter, his cigarette is lit...from someone else in the room! the camera pans out, and we realise that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some filming, some recording the death, and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die, and making a very hammy job of it too. when the audience realises what's going on, and the whole scene is part of a film, the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour.*end scene spoiler* i have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. firstly, it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly. a thriller in the style of hitchcock or de palma, with some very disorientating, and even blackly humorous moments. - it conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a 'movie screen death' and a 'snuff film death', an issue which is elaborated on later in the film), and finally, it introduces the viewer to the characters, all as silently as possible.the plot of mute witness centres around billy hughes, an american special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film, being shot in a large warehouse in moscow. billy cannot speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. after the end of an evening's filming, billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident, and in her attempt to escape, is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film, but turns out to be a snuff movie. suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death.without doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping. billy's saving grace, and her handicap is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound. (in fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock-full of women screaming). there are some utterly disturbing moments, and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (the corridoor, and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). the timing is fluid, and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself.the second half of the film introduces new concepts. while there are still several suspenseful moments, the focus is on plot twists. new characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on. while there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film, it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half. there are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from billy's sister and her fiancée, who happens to be the director of the movie billy is working on), that almost ruin the film, just because they are badly misplaced and/or mistimed and ruin the pace. - at the end, the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed, and the climax of the film is, appropriately, as tense as the first half.there are several things that really make the movie work. the barriers of communication that billy must face, both as a mute, and as an american in moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. the actress that plays billy, natasha zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an engaging on-screen prescence, and a brilliant performance, and finally, the direction as a whole, but most particularly in the first half of the film, which truly is a study in alfred hitchcock's suspense/thriller film techniques.as i have already said, though, the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. there is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of karen hughes and andy clarke (the sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com. however, despite these shortcomings, the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group viewing at halloween. (certainly better than the usual slasher horror film...!)

if you enjoy suspense this movie has it. the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. alec guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. i'm not sure if evan richard's part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. i thought the cinematography was excellent. this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done. i would call it overall good entertainment

i went into this film expecting a slasher, and while mute witness does take influence from said style of film-making, this is much more than just your average slash flick. there are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (blind terror, wait until dark, cat o'nine tails to name a handful), but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed, and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of. our mute witness is billy hughes, a make-up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in moscow. she finds herself locked in after hours one night, and after attempting to phone her sister for help, she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick, but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! she tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen, but finds that no one believes her story...recently hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country, but this film did it first and actually does a better job. it's maybe not quite as nasty as eli roth's opus, but the gore is more effective, and since director anthony waller (who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'the guilty') implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings, mute witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch. the director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides, as this one never stands still. the plot is put into action quickly, and waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film. the acting isn't bad for a b-movie, with young performers marina zudina, fay ripley and evan richards delivering good performances. the atmosphere is gritty, and the russian locations are suitably unfriendly, which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere. overall, mute witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be. the plot flows well, and the atmosphere and tension are spot on.

billy hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in moscow by an american director. one night billy gets locked in the movie studio. later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out. that's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered, while being filmed. after escaping the clutches of the murderers, billy informs the authorities, only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act. billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance.i don't know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by, but i thought it was a much older flick. there's one thing though, it's got to be one of the most jarringly, and intense thrillers i've seen in quite a while. it's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! the first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation. underling this is a humorously wicked black streak. faults do pop up in the story, as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between fay ripley and evan richard's characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful. in the long run, it probably could have done without. despite some cringe moments, this aspect didn't hinder my enjoyment of it. for me, the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right.the interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods. so multi-facet was the context and its thrills, there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists. really, they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation, by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke english and so we are caught up in the confusion too. the delicate marina zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the american mute girl billy. the way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability. director anthony waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish, well-timed and skillful manner, without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you. the only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by alec guinness. the performances by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turns by oleg yankovsky and igor volkov as the russian murderers.this riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller. highly recommended.

a couple of years before scream spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.this movie was mute witness. starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by sir alec guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, billie, who is working on a film on location in russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend andy. she is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence, a chase ensues, and finally she is rescued by andy who take her home as they alert the police. the trouble is... there is no body, no evidence that anything of the sort took place. even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on billie's side of the story....and to say more would be criminal. mute witness is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate, clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller, it's one that pays its dues to movies like wait until dark and the best of hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless, and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap. even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy, the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. very smart.

lifeforce was one of cannon films' biggest flops. it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe hooper's career in the wake of the spielberg/poltergeist controversy. all of this is unfortunate, because lifeforce is actually a really great movie. it is supremely entertaining, moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over-the-top direction, production, performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen! it must have looked bizarre on paper: the producers of the delta force, the screenwriter of alien, the director of the texas chainsaw massacre, the composer of breakfast at tiffany's, the special effects wizards of star wars... audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness.what more do you want??? we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats! we got a sexy, naked space vampiress sucking out people's souls! we got exploding bodies! we got zombies! we got possession! we got an s&m interrogation! we got the entire city of london on fire! it's dracula meets night of the living dead meets quartermass and the pit meets earthquake. it's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror/sci-fi/comedy/action/disaster/erotic/apocalyptic epic ever unleashed, that is, if there are any other ones out there.try watching this movie while chemically altered. perhaps then you'll understand. a genuinely f***ed up experience, and one of director tobe hooper's most underrated movies. maybe one day, it will find its audience.

danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. that honour belongs to lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley's comet running amok in london end-of-the-world movie ever made. tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. plus it offers space vampire mathilda may, the best thing to come out of france since simone simon, spending the entire movie naked. which she does very, very well. just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered, she's also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." it's a pitch meeting i'd have loved to have sat in on: astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley's comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue ("i've been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me." "assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter." "don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex."). oh, and we'll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil, the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster. sounds like a winner, here's $22m  have fun. and they do, they do.true, there's enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted 'plague' offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the go-go boys at cannon, what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan 10 from outer space. it's full-to-bursting with delirious inanity, be it frank finlay's hilarious death scene ("here i go!"), peter firth's grand entrance ("i'm colonel caine." "from the sas?" discreetly shouts michael gothard across a room full of reporters: "gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. this is a d-notice situation" he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offering mathilda may's naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people, the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs gorgo lost junior at battersea funfair and went on the rampage. and that's not mentioning the "this woman is a masochist! an extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's "it'll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me" line while a lead-stake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply "i'll do just that!" in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero's mind, steve "i-never-got-over-playing-charlie-manson" railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full-on "helta-skelta!" mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable aubrey morris (the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained) playing the home secretary sir percy heseltine as a kind of demented brian rix, peter firth (one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no-one was watching it anymore) hamming up the blasé public school macho in the hope that no-one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid-psychic-tornado to bring in more drugs. as if they needed any more in this film. it's just a shame that frank finlay's mad-haired scientist who isn't qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for klaus kinski) missed out on the action in that one.no matter how mad you think the film is, it still manages to get madder still, whether it be a zombie pathologist ("he too needs feeding") exploding all over the home secretary's suit, patrick stewart's blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st paul's cathedral into the world's biggest laser-show to transport human souls from the london underground to their geostationary mother ship. i loved every gloriously insane moment. in it's own truly unique way, this might be the greatest film ever made.the dvd offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited 101-minute us version, which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar, but also fully restores henry mancini's score to its original glory (the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie). although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb, with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards. sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras, though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hooper's originally intended 128-minute cut: from what's on display here, these might just offer even more comedy gold!

though it hardly compares to other sci-fi film giants like 2001: a space odyssey or close encounters of the third kind, lifeforce does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements. somehow, despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same, it manages to work because of a few highly different elements.loosely based on colin wilson's 1976 novel "the space vampires", this film from director tobe hooper (poltergeist; the texas chainsaw massacre) focuses on a joint us-british mission aboard the british space shuttle churchill to study halley's comet. led by an american commander (steve railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma. and when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. later on, the churchill reaches earth's orbit, but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission's home base, the space research center in london. columbia is launched to rendezvous with churchill, but they find the entire ship gutted by fire--all except for the alien beings encased in glass who, far from being untouched by the fire, look absolutely perfect. the aliens are bought back to earth...and that's where the incredible happens.these space vampires escape from the space research center and, instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds, suck their victims' lifeforce totally out of them. one of them is the space girl, a thoroughly nude vampiress played by mathilda may. railsback, the only actual survivor from churchill, is bought in by the src's chief (frank finlay) and a british special agent (peter firth) to track may, who is in telepathic contact with him. pretty soon, however, the vampires have turned london into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies, and the threat by nato to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large. railsback finally catches up with may, and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre.undoubtedly disjointed, unquestionably uneven, but nevertheless worth watching, lifeforce, despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting, benefits from some drop-dead excellent special effects work by john dykstra (star wars), some of the best ever seen. the other working element, and a surprise one it is, is the incredible orchestral score by henry mancini, almost wagnerian in the same way john williams' score for star wars was--and mancini, like williams before him, uses the london symphony orchestra, to boot!largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, lifeforce, if for no other reason, should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre. there had never been a film quite like it before, and there will certainly not be anything like it again.

like several other reviewers here, i'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. dan o'bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'alien' of 1979. because it and 'star wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'used' or 'dirty space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.rather than dismiss 'lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of british horror and science-fiction - specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass (specifically 'quatermass and the pit', 1967), doctor who and 'the day of the triffids' (1963), if not the works of gerry anderson ('ufo', 'space:1999' and 'thunderbirds'). but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o'bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'queen of blood'(1966) and 'it! the terror from beyond space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'alien' (1979).granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'an american werewolf in london' and 'the company of wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects.neil jordan's 'wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'american werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film. it's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'scream' franchise, 'i know what you did last summer' and 'final destination'. but these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'lifeforce' belong a canon of british sci-fi - even if this one was written by an american.in many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('independence day', 'armageddon', 'deep impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone. at the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn't examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade 'solaris'...the goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity.7/10

** and 1/2 stars out of **** lifeforce is one of the strangest films i've ever seen, so ridiculous, yet at the time it's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull. whether it's due to the nonstop nudity, the large amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.the spaceshuttle churchill has been sent to investigate halley's comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock. a small team, led by colonel carlsen (steve railsback), has been sent to search the area. what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (mathilda may). they decide to take all three back with them, which results in a catastrophe.when london receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. when they dock with the churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dessicated beyond recognition. the humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to london.after various tests, the scientists still don't know what these beings really are. then, late one night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held. he touches her shoulder, and she awakens, stands up, and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner. she approaches him, and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his lifeforce, sucking him of all of his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy).she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind. another man, colonel caine (peter firth), is brought in to track her down. then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process. the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours, and takes the lifeforce of a doctor. it seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. with the help of the churchill's sole survivor, carlsen, they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late.lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment. it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, loads of nudity, blood/gore, and plenty of special effects. this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, species, thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.the performances range from decent to terrible. faring the worst is easily steve railsback, who overacts to no end. much better are peter firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the gorgeous mathilda may (she's as beautiful as french actresses sophie marceau and emmanuelle seigner). may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. there are times when she can be quite creepy, being simply seductive. most of the film manages to work because of her.

daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood.comon paper, "daisy" sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true, directed by "infernal affairs" co-helmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl, popular korean actress jeon ji hyun. unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam , the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance.the plot follows hye young (jeon ji hyun), a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam , spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists. one day, she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge. one day she meets jeong woo (lee seong jae, also in "holiday" and "public enemy"), who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands .with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. however, it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi (jung woo sung, from "sad movie" and "musa"), an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate. inevitably, the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life.although "daisy" is ostensibly a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery. half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain, with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration. director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy, rather than yet another gloomy hit-man love story. as such, the proceedings have a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of "fulltime killer" and john woo's classic "the killer".almost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst, with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. park yi in particular, as the kind of overly emotional, socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema, is faintly ludicrous, from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing. this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow, and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence.fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama "the uninvited" than "my sassy girl" or "windstruck", and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there, her performance is certainly more subdued.the film benefits from glossy production values, and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery, playing on the contrast between the grey, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside. unfortunately, he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert. there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, though these are few and far between, and whilst well staged, seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse.despite its flaws, "daisy" makes for engaging viewing, and the story grips almost in spite of itself, mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with, but to see who will lie dying in her arms. the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre, and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy, weepy romance.it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but reorders some of the scenes, making the narrative less linear. although this new version is perhaps too long, it is surely superior, as without these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development.wai keung lau (director) / jae-young kwak (screenplay) cast: woo-sung jung . park yi sung-jae lee . jeong woo david chiang . cho ho-jin jeon . detective jang ji-hyun jun . hye-young dion lam . yun joon-ha

a young korean artist lives in amsterdam. she is a bit of a loner and has never had a serious relationship, insisting that she is "waiting" for the right person. she works in the public square, drawing portraits for passersby but, for herself, she also indulges in painting her favorite flowers, daisies. but, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 4:15, usually daisies, yet she can not catch the sender in the act. this is because, unknown to her, her beau is a korean hit-man, and he wishes to remain hidden, for now. one day in the square, however, another attractive korean man sits for the artist and happens to be carrying a pot of daisies. she concludes that he is her shy hero and, also, the man she has been waiting to find. this second gentleman, too, has a secret; he is an interpol agent. the assassin can see everything that transpires in the square, due to having an apartment close by. naturally, he is disturbed that another man has entered the young girl's life. how will this shadowy love triangle play out? this is a beautiful picture to watch. the setting in amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is very, very lovely. add in three most attractive young korean actors and, visually, any viewer has a stunning panorama in front of them. the story is quite nice, too, being a mixture of drama and action, with a dash of the unexpected. costumes are very fetching and the production values, high. in short, anyone searching for a quality foreign film with a compelling story and great scenery would find this movie a wonderful choice for a diverting evening. should you have someone's hand to hold during the view, so much the better.

i saw the korean version of daisy first. it came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish. i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive.then i got the dc and watched it. wow! i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen. amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! the dc is laid out like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. it moves at a slower pace than the korean version.the variations between both versions are so drastic, it seems like two totally different movies. i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again, toughing it out just to look for the added scenes. that wasn't the case. it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie.while the dc is 20 minutes longer than the korean version, you'll be hard-pressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed. 2 seconds chopped off here. a second added there. an entire scene added here. another erased there. in both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or chopped up and reordered. in some scenes, entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered - while the scene itself was untouched. even simple sound effects were added/omitted from each version - having a major impact on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad, somber one in the dc. the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. as far as i can tell, both versions end a lot different, and were intended that way.i'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film, and will find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring. if that's the case, look for the korean version. same movie, but different feel. i think there's a deluxe 3-dvd version that contains both cuts of the film - not sure.the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair, i'll watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies. alone, i'd say the korean version is a nice love story that i'd watch once in awhile. the director's cut, i'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, as i find the pacing dull. but they just go so well together! for what i consider the best experience, i'd say watch the korean version first. then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about.the editing is the real star of the film.

flowers! if it's one thing you'll take away from this movie, it's gonna be the flowers. they feature so prominently and are used as plot devices, you'll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends.set in amsterdam, daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. one a professional hit-man eking out a living, the other an interpol agent. featuring a pan-asian cast (korean, hong kong) and crew (director andrew lau from hong kong, writer from korea, and a thai post production team), i could imagine the headaches in coordination.park yi (jung woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for painter hye-young (played by the pretty jeon ji-hyun). it's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where her clumsiness caught his attention. however, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, do little (or perhaps big) things for her in an anonymous fashion, but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4:15pm. he becomes her guardian angel from afar, shielding her and keeping her safe from harm.hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. she is constantly waiting for him to appear, but i really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery. nonetheless, she's terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. however, as the stars would have it, interpol detective jeong woo (lee sung-jae) chances upon hye-young at a town square during one of his undercover missions, and he too is captivated by her. in a similar fashion, because of his profession, he is doubtful if he should make the first move.which is where the audience would find it frustrating. the lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy (then again, it's the "good" guy), park yi being infuriated by jeong woo's pursuit, but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself, and jeong woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly. it's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up.that aside, it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. and it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers, or their loved one. but fret not action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of infernal affairs, as well as ample gunfights, although i felt the ending could have been scripted tighter.what rocks is the clever editing. telling the story in a non-linear timeline (no worries, it ain't that bad, you'll still be able to follow the narrative) from the points of view of all the leads, keeping you in suspense, and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event, which i thought was extremely well-done.it's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares, with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul. as with romance movies, all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads, while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! ok lah, at certain angles) jeon ji-hyun.if you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action/tension department, then daisy would be your choice. if you prefer a more conventional weepy, then the other korean movie making its debut here at the same time, you are my sunshine, would be your alternative. and yes, i totally dig the ending scene, which i thought only the koreans do it best? kinda reminded me of the jsa one.

good to see i'm not the only person who remembers this great film. i have very fond memories of this movie - seem to vaguely remember back to when i was about 8 and i'd watch the kids tv shows after school (broom cupboard anyone?). this was the first and last film to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever! like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention. the lovely cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! i'd love to try and find this movie again - see if it still hits home!

i saw this film early one morning in the early 90s when i was about 12.i have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did!i remember enjoying it and being a little bit freaked out at the ending when it showed the gravestone of the young boy and his ghostly face!please could anybody let me no if i can get a copy of this as i would love to see it again.i remember the kid getting stuck down a cornish tin mine and then befriending a boy.cant remember that the kids were stuck there with miners but must have been.the boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who had died while working down there i think.

this film has "haunted" me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old. i didn't know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally. i remember being quite scared, because i'd just been to a tin mine in cornwall when i watched it, so could imagine it all. fortunately i didn't see any ghosts of dead children there, but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger. i've certainly never forgotten it, even though i couldn't find it anywhere. i seem to remember the children's film foundation films being generally good, but they don't show them at all any more. i also remember programmes like the children of green knowe in the same era on bbc - equally unsettling in its own way.

i remember watching this as a child as part of the children;s film foundations friday film specials on cbbc and have recently happened upon a copy.in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing.it is an atmospheric tale which entices with cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner billy.shot in the wonderfully scenic port loe area of cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable.there is much packed into this cff drama, something long since lost from children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy.

so after years and years i finally track this film down! i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, i remember chills running down my spine. watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. if anyone wants a copy, private message me.the story itself is fairly standard bcff stuff. its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that 'ghosts are here to help us?' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') there wasn't even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. however, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. the captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. oh well.

being cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining, this film is quite special to me. filmed in and around various locations in cornwall, it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of miners.the 'haunters' of the title refers to the 'spriggins' - ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there. events take place with an american wanting to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local kid josh is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy, he and his american 'girlfriend' set out to unravel the mystery behind his death, climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the spiggins save them.top film, albeit low budget and short, but worth a look if you're from cornwall and/or into tin mining!

this film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. indeed, at a first sight, it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money. but..let's take a look on the other side...what do you see? you see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have:should i do the right thing, or should't i? and... what's the "right thing"? le's make a deeper analyses... -what does it mean a little town in the border? - it means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't... - what does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture? - it means the dryness that sometimes take possession ot our offensed hearts... - what does it mean the phrase of the character (kristen) :"now i belong to him"? - it means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated deeds. in my opinion that's the writer of the story and the director tried to "tell" us. by the way...do you remember what another character (jack barnes)said:"nothing is so simple..."

i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels.... i was hooked from the very first minute. nothing is as it first seems, lots of suspense, great acting from mr. van dien, and i did not mind the "heat" in it one bit ;-) ... and, best of all: you are in for a surprise ending!!!

this film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir western - after the ill-conceived opening flashback sequence anyway. the scenery is beautifully desolate, the characters achingly isolated. while some of the acting is less than believable, the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look.

this movie moves and inspire you, it's like you are one of the family. just to see and witness life during the depression era, makes you feel humble and grateful. jonathan silverman delivered well, so convincing and very witty! a must see for teens!

blythe danner and judith ivey deliver wonderful performances here as jonathan silverman, as eugene, recounts his life in 1937's brighton beach.what makes the film so good is the relationships among the characters with a backdrop of extremely wonderful family values.bob dishy had a marvelous opportunity here as the father of the clan. he gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family.his sons played by jonathan silverman and brian dillinger are fabulous. there are certain scenes when silverman is skating or hopping where i'm reminded of jerry lewis.as for danner and ivey, they too are wonderful. their mannerisms, intonation and idealism of the jewish culture are beautifully realized by them.the cinematography is just wonderful. beautiful brighton in 1937! even as the inevitability of war loomed, the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. in a sense, you don't have to be jewish to experience what the family is going through.a must see for nostalgic buffs, and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.

as has already been noted, the short film "every sunday" (1936) could be considered the first music video. this was a happy accident resulting from mgm's need to crank out a variety of short films for exhibit with its feature length material. they had a couple fresh young singing talents (judy garland and deanna durbin) available and essentially slapped together a blend of music styles in a kind of norman rockwell concert in the park setting. who would have dreamed at the time that they would capture the best collection of images since eisenstein's "odessa steps" sequence. it's sunday with some inattentive folks sitting around a small wooden band shell in the park while a tired looking ensemble play strauss. events unfold and the next sunday judy and deanna save the day. the operatic deanna sings "il bacio" (the kiss) and garland follows with the contrasting "waltz with a swing". the climax nicely blends the two styles into a duet of "americana". a must see.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

every sunday is an eleven minute short subject featuring the talents of two of its young juvenile contract players, a pair who would develop into players of note in the future. it's interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of judy garland and deanna durbin as they perform at a sunday concert for deanna's uncle.of course no one knew how big both of these young ladies would get to be. i've always wondered why mayer kept garland and let durbin go to universal. l.b. always had pretensions to culture and this was the guy who had jeanette macdonald at his studio and later on hired such lovely soprano voices as jane powell, ann blyth, doretta morrow, etc.judy certainly had her glorious career at mgm, but she paid a heavy price for it. deanna, along with abbott&costello and several gothic horror monsters preserved universal pictures. she was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick.so, in their salad days, deanna durbin and judy garland.

this one reeler produced by mgm in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young stars under contract, judy garland and deanna durbin. in a way, these short films were promotional trailers that featured new talent in front, or behind the camera. felix feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public.the story is simple enough. the orchestra that entertains in a public park every sunday doesn't get the attention it deserves. enter two music aficionados, judy and edna, who love to hear the band play conducted by one of their grandfathers. two of the town's elders sensing there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience.the two girls embark in a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know, calling and running errands and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise they will attend the park concert next sunday. well, that day comes, and to their surprise, hardly anyone comes as the music starts. the two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing. the result is clear, people all over the park flocks to hear the talented young singers, thus ensuring the orchestra's existence.of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing by the two stars who are wonderful in their rendition. ms. durbin's operatic voice blends well with ms. garland's natural one creating a lovely duet.don't miss it whenever it shows on tcm!

canthony is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young judy garland (fourteen years old!) singing with a slightly older (by one year) deanna durbin. but i must disagree with everything else he or she said, including the running time -- which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (a single-reeler).the song is not her best, obviously; but it's enjoyable and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch on turner. the duet with durbin is quite interesting: two conflicting styles that nevertheless dovetail reasonably well.the short is just a throwaway, but it's nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer made it out to be. honestly, i enjoyed it.dafydd ab hugh

although little more than a pleasant 11-minute musical diversion (it's rightly billed as a "tabloid musical") every sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history, since it provides an invaluable look at the burgeoning talents of two of the screen's most talented and beloved musical performers: deanna durbin and judy garland.although often cited as an screen test of sorts, produced by mgm to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractees durbin and garland whose options were reportedly coming up for renewal, this assertion is not entirely accurate. by the time every sunday was produced in july, 1936, deanna durbin's contract with mgm had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by universal a month earlier, in june 1936.however, a provision in durbin's mgm contract permitted the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days, providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio. as durbin's debut vehicle, three smart girls, was still not ready to begin filming, mgm chose to exercise its' option and, although officially under contract to universal at the time, durbin found herself back on the mgm lot filming this agreeable short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful, judy garland.this, along with garland's far more extensive prior professional performing experience/training (which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts), may explain why every sunday often seems to favor judy garland over deanna durbin, giving garland more lines to speak and an original song ("americana") to sing, while durbin offers the popular classical art song, "il bacio" by luigi ardiiti. certainly, it would make perfect sense that mgm would want to favor one of its' own contract players over another from a rival studio.ironically, although garland's character is the more overtly pro-active one of the two girls in this short, it would be durbin's feisty and impulsive "little miss fixit" screen persona at universal which would propel her to instantaneous worldwide super stardom as the world's first "teen idol" with her debut vehicle, three smart girls, while garland's more passive "wistful wallflower" adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner mickey rooney and (in ziegfeld girl) the up-and-coming lana turner. not until her fifteenth mgm feature, 1942' for me and my gal (which was also her first fully "adult" role) would garland achieve the solo above-the title billing and "solo attraction" status of a true superstar that durbin had attained instantaneously six years earlier.it is entirely inaccurate, therefore, to assert that garland was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, as durbin attained this status with press 'n public, almost a decade before her mgm rival. literally in foreclosure at the time of her signing, the on screen evidence strongly suggests that universal was much quicker to realize deanna's full superstar potential than mgm was with judy, and it's worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment garland achieved at mgm, from superstar billing, to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal, to being invited to plant her footprints in the forecourt of graumann's chinese theater, to receiving an "honorary" oscar" in recognition for her talent, deanna durbin received well before her gifted mgm contemporary.in any case, every sunday is a delightful, utterly unpretentious musical short. its plot line (durbin and garland use their singing talents to save durbin's grandfather from being forcibly retired by the town council from conducting his sunday concerts in the park), presages the plot lines of both garland's "let's put on a show" musicals with mickey rooney and durbin's 100 men and a girl. unlike garland's later babes films, the short never treats the insubstantial storyline seriously, and consequently, its' eleven minute running time flies by.of course, the true magic of every sunday is in observing the already remarkable performing talents/screen presences of durbin and garland at the very beginning of their legendary careers. both girls, even at this early stage, possessed remarkable screen presences and are utterly natural and unaffected in their presentation as both singers and actresses. garland fairly explodes off the screen with vitality as she literally punches out the lyrics to the jaunty "americana." as she socks across the number with appropriate hand gestures, judy literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she screws up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can do.by contrast, durbin's presentation of "il bacio," is far more demure and subdued. although entirely appropriate for her "classical" selection, durbin's delivery of arditi's waltz is much more of the traditional "stand 'n sing" variety than garland's physically emotive turn. nevertheless, though "miniature diva" deanna does nothing to call attention to herself, with her candid eyes, dazzling smile and artless delivery, she easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" judy, and their delightful duetting of "americana" in the short's finale makes one regret all the more that producer joe pasternak was never able to realize his dream of pairing durbin and garland in a musical feature film (because universal refused to loan "number one asset" durbin out).a priceless document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents. see this one if you get a chance!

i'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie. i think it's a lot better than most of the teen films that have come out recently - ten things i hate about you ( can we say teeny bopper film and what was with the principle writing those porno novels ? ), cruel intentions ( where a character gives up their virginity because of a fun car ride ), and she's all that ( mediocre ). if your looking for something that's just fun - i say go with never been kissed. my mom loved it and she hates movies ( one of her favorites is beaches ). this is a great fantasy about what you would do different if you could go back to high school. people who were outcasts in high school will probably like this movie better. it reminds me of 'romy and michele's high school reunion'. and the ending puts me in the best mood. sure the plot has been done, but how many recent movies can you honestly say haven't been done in one form or another. the cast is also charming. and for those who think drew can't be geeky - she pulls it off just great. another good teen comedy that i recommend which was made recently is election but it's more of a satire on school and politics.

there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it is a tad predictable. drew barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film - excellent casting choice. what i found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her - in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how awful drew's character was (ostrich feathers?) at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away, regardless of what rumors her brother drums up. (and does "kole slaw food" really make him all that popular? i doubt it). as for rooting for drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, i would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. a bit contrived. having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much.

"the china syndrome" launched a whole string of films about the potentially devastating effects of misused nuclear power, a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over america for much of the reagan years. it's a well-made and effective drama, given an extra punch by its high-power stars, notably jack lemmon who plays a senior official of the nuclear power plant who suffers a crisis of conscience. but one can't help but think that it was the serendipitous timing of the three mile island nuclear accident that occurred just a couple of weeks after this film's release that has given it its lasting appeal as a classic from the 70s. as watchable as it is, it's certainly no classic.with a red-headed jane fonda as a news reporter and a bearded michael douglas as her camera man (and the film's producer, by the way).grade: b+

i saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it. i moved to norway four months ago, and have tried ever since to find the origin of the strange emptiness i felt. when i saw this film i was striken with the brilliant snapshot of this society. yes, this is all true!!! i too found a great job with a great pay, and i live with my norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment downtown. but, so far everyone i have met have left me with that tasteless, empty feeling i had never had before - this is what this movie is about. dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but emotionless comments, long silences, no stress, a creepy calm, and frozen smiles of niceness. this scandinavian nightmare is perfectly rendered in den brysomme mannen. see this movie!!!

andreas arrives in a strange, inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. he's given a good work, everyone is kind to him and to everyone, and he really doesn't trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend. but in this no-named city andreas finds soon that a perfect commercials-type world is really not a paradise. really one of the better movies i've seen this year. the attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component (cool desaturated photography; cold symmetrical design; unemotional acting; slow, highly controlled camera movements) helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end. a sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh ant think, as only best films are able to do. nothing new, probably, in the analysis of the modern de-humanizer civilization, but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it. simply beautiful the amazing scene in the metro underground.

one of the best films i've seen in a long time, precise in its vision, and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization. i can't say much without giving it away, and i don't recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing--just see it.but ah, one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on imdb. conundrum. what can i do? tell you about the film? nope. can't do it. i think i enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no preconceptions. please you do the same.i suppose this can be said: the acting is excellent and understated, and what i have come to love about foreign movies is that the movies are actually about the movies, not the stars.

what we have here is a film perfect for anyone that participates in the world of post-industrialism: those who sit in their privatized home, earning money by buying and selling sensual-less commodities and perpetuating a system that values little other than the preservation of self.the beautiful filming (i always appreciate fix 35s and soft boxes) makes it an even stranger place to travel through, both enjoyable to look at but frightening to comprehend (perhaps that's overly dramatic, but its true).andreas' journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. his quest is honorable, laudable, and precious. the conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he's better off, which is the perfect conclusion.breve! highly recommended to all people who view their world with a critical eye and especially to those who don't (perhaps it will encourage a reflection or two).

the movie was excellent, save for some of the scenes with esposito. i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series, and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to nbc...). it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human, and most basic persons. braugher and secor did a great job, but as usual will get overlooked. it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide. memories, tapes, and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday. but the movie did its job and did it very well, presenting a great depiction of life after al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. i enjoyed this a lot.

my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film. does it work? yes. gee runs for mayor and gets shot. the homicide "hall of fame" turns up. pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series. a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too. the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up. and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox. this is a good film.

following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc, it was decided to do just one last super installment. the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block-buster of a tv hour. it had always had a sizable, hard core of hard corps of followers. it was almost as if the series with the full title of "homicide: life on the street" (1993-99) was a sort of "mr. in-between" of series. it was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of 'rabid ratings ravings' over. during the precarious tenure on friday evenings, they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas. there, i've said it artistic, artistic!! but please, remember we mean artistic, but not just phony, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct preaching.when at last, it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for "homicide"; this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie. looking at all the past seasons' happenings and parade of regular characters, the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off.our story. as we join the story, we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer, lt. al giardello has "pulled the pin", retired from the job, that is. but 'g' isn't ready to really retire-retire yet. so, instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod, we find that al is running for mayor of 'charm city.'while out in the city, making some campaign stops and speeches, the former detective lieutenant takes an assassin's bullet. alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the hospital. news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned, we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance. there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead.the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story. they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones. the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way. but at least for now, we'll leave that as "classified".in wrapping up everything into a neat, little package, this tv movie surely gets our endorsement. as for grading "the homicide movie", we must give it an a or a+, even. but, no matter the grade here, it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode.

homicide: the movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted series. loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season. the entire series, and especially the movie, provided a life-like look at life (and death) in baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore, but once i experienced life here for myself, i realized how realistic it was. and the movie certainly retained that spirit. i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series, but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city.

what can i say? an excellent end to an excellent series! it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia, but by far, the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison. ever! the end of a great era. sorry to see you go...

in all truth, this really isn't a "movie" so much as an extended final episode; by this i mean that, had you not followed the tv series (homicide: life on the street) i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie. having said that, "homicide: the movie" is still a great watch. i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return, many after years of absence, to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. the movie brings out that sense of "family", not only amongst the characters, but amongst the actors, as well. it's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide. story-wise, i found this film somewhat lacking. giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived, and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position, as leiutenant. also, det. bayliss's extreme plot twist, which was left hanging at series end, is finally resolved, but i, for one, never felt that it needed to be; i enjoyed being left with a mystery (let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run!). as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie, and the fact that it even got made after h:lots had been canceled, but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series. now, if they'd just release it on dvd...

i have always been a huge fan of "homicide: life on the street" so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up, i couldn't wait.let me just say, i was not disappointed at all. it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen. it was great to see everyone back again, but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back, because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show.

i became a fan of the tv series `homicide: life on the street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. it was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. homicide: the movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. after lt. giardello (yaphet kotto), now a candidate for mayor of baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. in addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. the intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. all in all, a terrific tv movie.vote: 9

this film is so different to anything you would have seen before. it's an honest and chilling account of an entire family's battle with a terminal illness. 'the closer she gets' is shot in a very unique style. craig oulette films in a very different way.... using different angles and viewpoints, in what i find is a very eye catching manner (perhaps due to his experience with photographic works). his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing, but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with. a very sad, but extremely interesting and unique film. one i would definitely suggest watching.

the closer she gets... is an artful documentary dealing with the death of a person i actually knew. it allows a glimpse into the private moments of the family involved in the most trying time of their lives. parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case the subject of the documentary went above and beyond. she was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. it is a most touching work of art, weaving the serious, serene, and lighter sides of life for this family. the story is one which can make you laugh, but also cry as it addresses issues we all must face. i highly recommend this documentary to those unafraid to cry, and are willing to deal with the issue of mortality in a most human manner. this film will touch you.

i saw this documentary film at the 2005 slamdance independent film festival. this documentary is shot, directed and edited by a son (craig) of his mother's year long battle with cancer. shot over the course of one year "the closer she gets", is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inside look of a family's struggle with battling with the cancer, the viewer gets an inside point of view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the entire process. i have never seen such an honest film, this is a powerful and raw film, and since it wasn't shot by an outsider you get the true emotions of everyone involved. many documentaries are shot by an outsider, but having this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film, unlike any i have seen before on this subject or any other. this is a touching story that everyone should see, and can relate to. i would highly recommend it.

i went into "the closer she gets" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. i expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. and although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. it shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. they refuse to lose faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. the most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. in this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. we should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.

there are so many episodes that make me howl over the storiesthat i wish i could pick the best ones , rocko and bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and bs their way out of hard time just to drag dan into their life of crime .canadians will notice the odd joke for toronto or the federal government, and because the cbc axed a really good show by the frantics that dan was part of , the show takes shots at them and in the episode "dan's umbrella" the cbc is raked across the coals .when dan says that the cbc would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture , rocko enters the room and gives dan back his tape of friday-night with ralph benmurgue , this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the cbc's history for making shows people don't watch or axing good shows that they do watch.

so totally unique and entertaining! another great canadian invention. a regular "joe"(dan) and a bunch of misfit delinquents (aka puppets), all share residence at a half-way house. its dan's job to keep an eye on four 'menaces to society' and help them to rehabilitate. bill, the homicidal dummy, rocko the cigarette smoking dog, buttons, the nympho teddy bear, and cuddles the comfort doll. the five of them find themselves in all sorts of odd predicaments. despite their homicidal, and often overtly perverse sexual tendencies, it's hard not to find them lovable.i give this show a 10/10 simply because it provides good entertainment, without needing a huge budget, and exudes a canadian flair that makes me proud.

remember greg the bunny? it was this show that started on the independent film channel, but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox. my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny, beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tv-pg material. puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe, where puppets live in the same world as people, and like us, take on jobs and lives of their own. let's just say if you couldn't handle that, then don't bother watching pwk, as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse, hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half-way house. there's plenty of violence, sex, and bad language (so it would never make its way to u.s. network tv). as if sociopathic puppets weren't enough, the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing (btw, the government pays for this), and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this. i don't know where you can get it in the u.s., beyond extra satellite tv, but i'd advise you give it a try. really funny stuff. (it airs on the comedy network in canada)

a refreshing interview with the legendary italian cinematographer-producer-director who passed away in 1999 with close to 200 features to his credit as director. a large portion is spent on d'amato's softcore sex films including his notorious emanuelle entries with laura gemser. they also briefly cover his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade or so. more interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and action efforts. d'amato has plenty of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film-making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2,000-year-old catacomb. other interviewees include george eastman and al cliver. i would have liked a bit more conversation about his stateside filmirage productions (not a single question about troll 2; granted it wasn't the cult film then it was now).

i was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite italian directors. d'amato has dabbled in everything from horror, post-apocalyptic to hardcore porn. he has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like buio omega and emmanuelle & the last cannibals. this documentary is a lenghty and informative guide to the films of d'amato. he is interviewed throughout with english subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen. the excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator (with english subtitles). the documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored "emmanuelle in america". here d'amato explaines the faked "snuff" scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories. in fact, good ol' joe is very warm and funny throughout, always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette. the one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on d'amato's horror films like anthropophagus and the brilliant buio omega. it spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post-apocaplyptic films. but, i can't complain. it is wonderful to see d'amato get the respect he deserves. highly recommended for fans of d'amato. may he rest in peace.

this documentary is as unique as it's subject. and while d'amato's staple was erotica, the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time, late night cinemax... one problem... joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica, even mixed in his gore films. the gore films are cult classics, going for like $20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net (not peanuts for 20 year old films, folks.) i want to see why those are cult classics. also, as sweet as joe seems (he did seem more elegant than one might expect,) the dude liked to shock. both "caligula: the untold story" and "emanuelle in america" show us hardcore rape, snuff, and beastiality (in both, you'd be suprised how far he goes in "caligula ii" with that one, if you can track down an uncut print.) although these scenes may be disconforting in a documentary of a persons career, hey, he did it... also, i would have liked to see more interviews of people joe worked with... maybe that's just me wanting to see what laura gemser looks like these days... i still think she's a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre.

i suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds. the copy i saw focused heavily on joe's erotic films and referred to his horror output in passing. there are numerous x-rated films presented in their x-rated glory and emmanuelle in america's legendary "snuff" footage (the breasts being cut off) is given generous screen time.the interviews with the highly likable joe are informative and candid. he is an unassuming, articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to mix erotica with horror, and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay.his friendship and working relationship with indonesian beauty laura gemser is touched on, as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore.joe d'amato personifies an incredible period in continental cinema that has now passed. it is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine, unique work.rip, joe.

"watch the skies" (2005 - 60 minutes) is an excellent documentary about movies of science fiction. it was produced and directed by the critic richard schickel, author of more than 20 books on this theme. mark hamill is the documentary narrator. schickel joins directors as steven spielberg, james cameron, george lucas and ridley scott to carry through a trip in time and space to show some of the most memorable science fiction movies of the fifties and also some more recent classics. the documentary shows six different approaches: the paranoia of the atomic war; the fantastic trips to the moon; the enigmatic planet mars; good and evil aliens; the after-apocalyptic world; and the humanity future. it presents comments and scenes of the following classics: the flying saucers, rocketship xm, destination moon, the space children, the beast from 20,000 fathoms, godzilla: king of the monsters, the incredible shrinking man, attack of the killer tomatoes, a trip to the moon, the angry red planet, forbidden planet, the thing from another world, earth vs. the flying saucers, i married a monster from outer space, invasion of the body snatchers, the blob, the war of the worlds, the day the earth stood still, et: the extra terrestrial, the omega man, the planet of the apes, the terminator, 2001: a space odyssey, things to come and metropolis. highly recommended to science fiction fans!

i was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what i considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made. growing up in l.a. during the 60's many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations. i even remember a friday night show called "strange tales of science fiction" that showcased a different sci fi flick every week. this documentary however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic movies of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmaking.that is not what i was hoping for in this documentary. it really could have been a comprehensive examination of the decade instead of a brief highlighting of the most well known films of the era. anyone who has studied or been interested in these films are pretty familiar with standouts such as war of the worlds, forbidden planet, the thing, the day the earth stood still, etc. i would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these movies. i would have to agree the documentary was way too focused on spielberg's opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of war of the worlds.

despite the previous reviewer's screed, this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci-fi films that influenced spielberg, lucas and others in their more recent efforts. i agree that spielberg's films aren't even in the same league as the films discussed here, such as william cameron menzies' brilliant invaders from mars, to name just one of the many titles examined, but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid sci-fi. yes, it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of war of the worlds during the last fifteen minutes; you can turn that off. the rest is surprisingly good, and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them, even if they can't begin to match the originals.

um .... a serious film about troubled teens in singapore, a country i have not much knowledge on but have the previous wrong impression that all the kids there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government. well, i guess i am wrong, just like other cities/ countries, they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs, fights, bad language, and .... many other obvious signs of being a bad boy. the surprising part of this film isn't really about how these kids running around causing themselves and others trouble, but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so call loyalty between them. the bond between these "brothers" may very well originated from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys. though it isn't uncommon for str8 guys to have very close friendship with each other, but watch this film closely, it should be entering all sorts of gay film festivals and i would not be surprised that it may win itself a lot more awards toward this direction!

i'm totally agree with garryjohal from singapore's comments about this film. quotation: 'yes non-singaporean's can't see what's the big deal about this film. some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually 'get' it.' it's still not quite the truth and as a malaysian-chinese, i do 'get it' although i don't speak hokkien because we do have the similar 'problems' in malaysia too. i know that it's really hard to understand and to accept this as a reality but it is definitely not a 'no real story'. i was pleased to see this film outside malaysia because it will and definitely be banned in malaysia too. which means either you get it in 'illegal copied vcds or dvds' or hope that someone to be kind enough to 'share' it in the internet. this is not an 'another violent teen drama.......' because it portrays the reality which exists in singapore (and in malaysia too) in an interesting way (sad+humour). i was just a little sad to know that this film got about 20 cuts in censorship. what a waste!

this is the first movie i've seen from singapore and it's great. if you don't know a lot about asia, its languages and its culture, then this film may be a bit confusing for the non-informed people. as an asian-american who's double majoring in two asian languages (one of them being mandarin) and has taken some asian american studies classes, this film was easier for me to understand, but even without that kind of knowledge, i believe this movie is still accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that it's a coming-of-age type of movie. the film is definitely worth seeing just so that you get the chance to see what kind of issues singapore's young teenage boys are struggling and having to deal with. this is an awesome coming-of-age movie, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. the actors are outstanding.

yes non-singaporean's can't see what's the big deal about this film. some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually 'get' it. but i plead with you, foreigner, look at the other crap that's been churned out from singapore and compare it to this film. it's like comparing a mule's diarhhoea chunks to a little diamond. this film is the first to truly show some the singapore's seedy underbelly - something the forces that be, pretend does not exist. and there's a part in the film where a gangster(ah-beng in our unique colloquial 'ingris') curses in 4 languages, namely tamil english malay and hokkien. well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time. the sad thing is that viewers from foreign contries will have an easier time getting their oily little claws on this gem, in its country of origin, it was banned initially, only to be given and r-rating, and that too with about 20 cuts to it. it's nice to know you that one of the best, creative, edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain unadulterated, uncensored; halfway across the world than in your own nation.

the chasers war on everything. 5 words that i love to watch. the chasers war on everything is an excellent australian comedy. as the name suggests they wage war on everything. they seem to love hitting the politions most of all.the chaser is one of the best comedies i have seen and is the top of the line in australia. it is on the australian broadcasting corparation (abc) which is where some of the best comedies are.it has won the australian film industry (afi) awards but did not win the best comedy at the logies. last year (2006) the chaser was aired on abc on friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it. well they have been moved to wednesday nights at 9pm (a heaps better timeslot) and the best thing is if i miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can download it from www.abc.net.au/chaser.

this program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. australia produces very little good programs - most of the tv which i watch (and i live in australia) is from the us and england.the funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is. like when they went past numerous security barriers at the apec summit pretending to be canadian diplomats.the show is made up of pre-filmed stunts, general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on-stage skits. these all come together to make a fabulous, extremely funny tv show. the segments like "ad road-test" and "message from osama bin ladin" are hilarious. for anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical tv comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch.all the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour.i would rate it 10/10.

if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life, i would definitely have to pick "the chaser's war on everything". of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television, i found "chaser" to be the funniest of all. it is just so amazing, the boys aren't afraid to do anything.whether it's dress up as hitler to get into a polish club, or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the tourism ad's or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with $2.40 to buy some water. the chaser boys will go there.in agreement with the comments above (and/or below) "the chaser's war on everything" is more popular than their previous program "cnnnn". but cnnnn was just as funny. some unforgettable moments from that show... clean up cambodia!!! classic.so anyway to stop me from ranting further, i strongly advise you to at least give chaser a chance, you'll more than likely find it hilarious!!!!

for one used to the comedies on television now- whether sketch, sitcom or animated, it's nice to watch something truly refreshing.the chaser has to be the best comedy of this decade, seinfeld being the last's triumph. it follows the hosts urban crusades to fix situations, do 'ad road tests' and try to get the facts from our politicians the good old fashioned way.despite being very controversial at times, the shows excellent quality, from the well made and truly funny opening credits to the sketch style investigations (sketch style only in time, they are not scripted, at least, not the ones at the other end of the joke) is certainly worth watching. even the most cynical and intellectual viewer won't be disappointed, and the show deserves ten stars.all in all, well done to the abc for showing this and i recommend it highly.

i don't particularly care from michael jackson. aside from being a pedophile, i really do not like his music, with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album, thriller. this is one of them. i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made.this was directed by john landis, best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london. this music video is not so much a music video but more or less, a short horror film. m.j. and his date are at a werewolf movie. when they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when michael jackson does his famous "thriller" dance.you know, this actually is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats. this and "beat it" are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over. i especially love vincent price's cameo as the narrator. his distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. even if you don't like m.j.'s music, you need to see this video at least once. by the way, he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose.
