ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day. the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. they know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at albert hall in london.the movie is rich in hitchcockian incidents. a friendly but opaque frenchman seems to grill the innocent stewart -- a doctor from indiana -- a little too intensely to be merely idly curious. later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers some information about the murder plot to stewart. stewart tells his wife -- doris day looking very saucy indeed -- but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life.instead the couple try to track down the assassins, buy them off, and get their son back, taking them from morocco, where hitchcock has given us his usual tourist's eye view of the customs, locations, and food, to london. there is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set-to between stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. the staff are more concerned about guarding their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. in the course of the scuffle, stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill, but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger, the action boosted along by bernard hermann's bumptious score. the scene ends with stewart rushing out the door. hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion's head gaping at the slammed door. there is also a running gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in london, waiting for things to be explained.there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on. one is the relationship between stewart and day, which is not as rosy as it ought to be, considered as a bourgeois ideal. she's been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. and she's given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. that's understandable in, say, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right. it isn't delved into, but the edginess is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe dimaggio and his then-wife marilyn monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea. "oh, joe," she gushed, "did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer?" "seventy thousand," muttered joe, former hero of the new york yankees.the second problem is one of allegiance. who is of greater social value? one's own young son? or an unknown ambassador. do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the albert hall. her solution opts for allegiance to political stability, although her motives are problematic. does she scream to save the ambassador's life, or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her? (cf: alec guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "the bridge on the river kwai.") the photography is extremely good, and the settings can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of london. it's mid-day, and stewart is alone and determined, but frightened too. there are footsteps echoing on gulliver street from someone, somewhere. is he being followed? is his life in danger? and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street? hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him.the director had a rare disagreement with francois truffaut while being interviewed for truffaut's otherwise laudatory book. truffaut argued that the earlier version of "the man who knew too much" lacked the depth of the later version. hitchcock replied, "it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional. no argument there.this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenith.

"the man who knew too much" falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense by any means, but an awful lot of fun nonetheless.james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue. the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert, where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score. the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is, so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist.so much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy "foul play" that i have to believe that film was inspired by this. neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy.grade: b+

dr. ben mckenna (james stewart) and jo mckenna (doris day) travel to morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named louis bernard (daniel gélin) on a bus.the next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells ben a secret; an assassination will take place in london.the crooks kidnap the couple's son hank (christopher olsen) making sure ben won't reveal their plan to anybody.alfred hitchcock's the man who knew too much (1956) is a very intense thriller.the acting is superb as it always is in hitchcok's films.james stewart is marvelous.doris day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well.the song que sera, sera has an important part in the movie.this movie is a movie of many classic scenes.in the final scenes at the albert hall, done without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes.this movie is fifty years old now.time hasn't decreased its power in any way.

hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of mckenna marriage(james stewart, doris day, in the first version leslie banks, edna best) along with their 11-years-old son travelling through morocco during vacations. in a bus they know a sympathetic french person(daniel gelin, in the old version pierre fresnay). while they are in marrakech they also know a couple(bernard miles and brenda de banzie) and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing, the dying whispers a political message.then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and mckenna gets help to morocco's inspector buchanan(ralph truman).this is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by james stewart and doris day. this exciting film displays suspense, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama well written by john michael hayes and charles bennett . packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician: innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny, intelligent villains. colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in morocco and london studios by cameraman robert burks, though with excessive transparency for marrakech scenes. lavish sets by henry bunstead, hitchcock's usual, and working until his recent death. of course,the highlights are the happenings of the famous royal albert hall of london assassination where a sneering killer, reggie nalder, tries to execute while composer bernard herrmann is conducting orchestra. besides at the climax doris day singing ¨que sera, que sera¨, meantime her son suffering risks, the song won oscar for ray evans, jay livingstone . the story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. rating : better than average, hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it.

i put this second version of "the man who knew too much" to my top 10 hitchcock movies. together with "frenzy", it's probably the most argued film among the fans of hitchcock. i consider it far better than, say, "rebecca", which has gained unreasonably much appreciation.the film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but that's something to be expected from hitchcock. it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used for preparing the following happenings, which are full of intriguing suspense.if you can ignore the clumsy rear projections, the only weakness of this film is the main villain, played by bernard miles, who is a rather flat and undeveloped character. luckily, there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie nalder. and hank, the little boy, isn't as irritating as most kids in old movies.

the movie, which was directed by alfred hitchcock, was brilliantly made. it starts with a family of three, a doctor (james stewart), his wife (doris day)- who is a former stage singer, and their young son- my guess is about 10 years old, who are traveling through morroco for leisure. on the bus, the bump into a french government agent, and they are a little too nice to him. he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought. he wants to carry this information out to someone, so he goes to the only person he, even slightly, knows: james stewart. the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. stewart has to travel to london, because that is where his son is, and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be. the movie is very suspenseful. there are many twists and turns (typical hitchcock movie). also, it has just the right amount of comic relief. in addition to all of that, it won an oscar for doris day's performance of "que sara, sara." this movie is very good. it is hard to find a problem about it. i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. i give this movie an "a-" only because it is a little bit predictable.

"the man who knew too much" (1955) is alfred hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (james stewart and doris day) on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder, espionage, assassinations and the worst of all, kidnapping of their 10-years-old son. the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun. stewart and day have a good chemistry together. the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense. the inclusion of "que sera, sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like "que sera, sera" did in "the man who knew too much". hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin "storm cloud cantata" for almost ten minutes while scene in london's royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.

a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception - it's a remake! doris day is in it! she sings! - hitchcock's second crack at 'the man who knew too much' is his most under-rated film, and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.this is, in more ways than one, doris day's film. not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against james stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. this is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? consider: day's jo mckenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. this seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. but look at the way stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage over her concerns about louis bernard, implying that she is jealous that bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career. this is clearly a recurrent joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement, and that they both realise it.after their son has been kidnapped, stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. this is a cruel scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage - he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions, in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career.the potency of that voice is demonstrated in the ambrose chapel sequence, when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. at the albert hall, it is her need to cry out, to exercise those impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the embassy finale, it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. by contrast, all of stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall, and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed, thus depriving the police of potentially useful information. it is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice, in the rescue of hank from the embassy, that he actually succeeds in doing something useful.far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing, 'que sera sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the mckennas; 'the future's not ours to see' indeed. it also neatly prepares the way for the finale, in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day.the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature - the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall. this lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. we see people conduct conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. we don't need to - the images say everything. it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds. the editing is incredibly tight, matched to the music perfectly. there isn't a frame out of place - anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is playing out. it builds slowly, but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable. when jo screams, it isn't just a relief for her, but for the audience.the ambrose chapel sequence is witty, and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick-in-the-mud nonconformist church. the embassy sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that preceded it on first viewing, but second time around actually seems more effective, with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background, reminiscent of the music-as-ambient-noise in 'rear window'. the score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music from on-screen sources to be foregrounded effectively.bernard miles is a low-key villain, a little banal, but with a dry wit. he's outshone by brenda de banzie as his wife, who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin - her stance is pure gangster's moll, belying the middle-england exterior, but she clearly has a soft side, and possibly maternal feelings towards hank.stewart is excellent, although if hitchcock really did always cast him as 'everyman', as the director's daughter seems to think, then it confirms that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive necrophiliac in vertigo. day is nothing short of phenomenal. just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdoes anything, but neither does she sell it short. this is one of hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the mckennas; they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.

many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much, which i have not had the opportunity to view. by itself, the '56 version is a very well done film. the run of mid-to-late fifties hitchcock films (including "rear window", "dial m for murder", "vertigo", and "to catch a thief", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career. in the man who knew too much, jimmy stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always. doris day is very believable in the role of an atypical hitchcock blond. i thought there was nothing fake about her performance. her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "yes, dear", pretty thing on jimmy stewart's arm.there were some really clever lines written for hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- it's too bad christopher olsen read them so woodenly. it's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though. most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, though- most notably the assassin (played by reggie nalder). some little touches that make this film undeniably hitchcockian- the use of non-english dialog, especially french (something hitch did on a much larger scale in "to catch a thief"); the use of foreboding, arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; stewart and day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the albert hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect hitch used at the end of "spellbound", also).all in all, the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch. it's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ("vertigo", "strangers on a train"), but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces.

alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 british film, "the man who knew too much". this 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. mr. hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next, thus keeping a standard in his work. robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini's editing shows his talent. ultimately, bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture.james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr. hitchcock. in this version, he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son. when we meet him, they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins. his wife is the lovely doris day at her best. she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. the film has some good supporting cast, brenda debanzie, bernard miles, daniel gelin, alan mowbray, among others, do a great job in portraying their characters.although this is a "light hitchcock", one can't dismiss it as a failure. "the man who knew too much" is a change of pace for hitchcock's fans.

many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message, thus confusing the hero, not to mention the audience...dr. ben mckenna (james stewart) and his wife jo, a former musical star (doris day) are vacationing in morocco with their son, hank (christopher olsen), when they meet mr. and mrs. drayton, a british couple (brenda de banzie and bernard miles). they are also befriended by a charming frenchman, louis bernard (daniel gelin), who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute...the mackennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the draytons, when they spot louis bernard... the next day in the market place, they are caught in an assassination intrigue... while they are wandering in the local market, the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers... dr. mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms, a knife sticking out of his back... gulping his last breath, the dying man mutters some words and collapses... dr. mckenna is completely taken aback when the arab's hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise... mckenna is left knowing too little, but as far as the assassins are concerned, too much...to prevent dr. mckenna from revealing what he knows, the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage... the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnappinghow to get the little boy back safely... the subplot about the assassination is just the setup...the film is a breathless escapade... the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it... stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor, accidentally involved in political intrigue... his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly humana person we could easily identify with... it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film... by 1956, the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer... she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth etting's biopic, 'love me or leave me,' but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents...the casting of character actor reggie malder as the assassin, is brilliant... the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil...

this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union. while nice guy dean jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons. so, it's up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day.this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8--it was that good. however, for the life of me, i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about westerns. his forte was drama--and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts--just set in the old west. strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job.as for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting. as usual, randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance. i was surprised, though, with robert young being also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision--he was supposed to be a harvard-educated easterner. when i saw barton maclane was also in the film, i pretty much assumed he'd be the "baddie" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of playing jerks! as for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.

western union tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west. siblings dean jagger and virginia gilmore work for western union, and randolph scott and robert young work for the creightons. indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop america's progress. this sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and vibrant color photography. scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways, and both he and engineer young vie for the attention of the perky gilmore. lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward.

this is a sort of hidden gem. it has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! one of the great directors of cinema, fritz lang, has created a real gem in this excellent western. a fine cast led by randolph scott (in probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy dean jagger, robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors: chill wills, slim summerville, john carradine, barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country. it has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects. it's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it. at very least this is a damned good western!

here's another of the 1940's westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc, because although it may be flawed historically, it is extremely entertaining and well acted, plus it's got randolph scott, my favorite actor second only to gary cooper-well, ok, fourth behind coop, charlton heston, and gregory peck. but the film itself, to me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before, well acted and "flows" very well-i bet i've seen it 50 or 60 times, and enjoy each viewing more than the one before. i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd. see it if you haven't- i guarantee you'll like it!

lang does hawks as well as hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling down into typical deterministic, dark and guilt-haunted lang for the finale.this is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. vance shaw (randolph scott) is on horseback and being pursued, we know not why -- he stumbles on wounded edward creighton (dean jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but discovering that creighton is in a bad way, decides to fix him up first. this is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief, clipped dialog - in 2 minutes we know that shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. shaw ends up helping creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.cut to a few weeks or months later, with creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from omaha. he hires shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he finds out that creighton is in charge; but creighton wants him anyway, repaying a debt and sensing something quality. also hired is a tenderfoot, son of a benefactor of the project, but atypically the easterner richard blake (robert young) is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco-busting sequence. both of the hires vie for creighton's sister sue (virginia gilmore) who - again not typically - seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. the camaraderie between the three men, the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of howard hawks' "red river" or "only angels have wings" than most lang - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter, and doesn't alter our pleasure - if it does perhaps change our expectations - as the more usual langian themes of the haunted past, dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier, destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward; attacks mount on the crew, and shaw has to wrestle with what, if anything, he is to tell creighton about his tortured relationship with jack slade (barton maclane), leader of the outlaws.beautifully shot in early technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations, this is for my money easily lang's best western and one of his very best films, conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. scott is as good as i've seen him, showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog, and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. the inevitable showdown between shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a longtime lang devotee such as myself; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. you can get a shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back.genius.

this movie is a perfect example of barkers cinematic gifts to the horror/ monster genre. i thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comic books (or actually, the comics may have come second, i forget). this movie was made for barker fans. it helps to have read the book beforehand, but isn't that important if you can follow a film. i saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film, read the book, then re-watch the film. you might find a new respect for the movie. i came to this movie a big fan of barker already, and having read the book prior, loved the film instantly. there are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing, etc in this film. this movie does something that most monster/ horror movies fail miserably at, show the monsters. they are there in full color, not hidden in shadows, and taking most of the screen time. unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque, and casts them into the forefront as the good guy. two thumbs up clive. we're waiting for the thief of always :)

i absolutely love this movie. i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday. this movie brings up several questions. one is. who are the monsters of this world? to be different is just that. different. the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. they are those that everyone considers "a nice quiet bloke" who "didn't bother anybody". or they are worse they are the characters such as played by croneberg. men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood. i love the shapeshifters, people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon. this movie touches on and explores what is normal. who are 'other' and what fear does to some. even though i gave this movie 10 i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median. my other complaint was why didn't they ever make a second film. i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end

it's a horror story alright. but perhaps not as you know it. the real monsters in this flick are humans. while the monsters, are human and prey. as weird as that may sound i see this as "monsters inc" for horror film fans.sure, the effects are of a std horror film, the monsters are there as in any monster based film, the gore is there as well, there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker (played by david cronenberg; i see flash of cillian murphy as dr. jonathan crane in batman begins here - or is it the other way round?). and it is decker &c who are the bad guys. the monsters want mainly to mind their own business, warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided, wanting to join there society.by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes....

i'd love to see some tie-in between nightbreed, the fury, and the x-men series, sort of the way the second outer limit's series would tie-in particular stories and plot-lines after the fact, to create a story arc although one was never intended. i'd also like know if some more information - anecdotal or otherwise, exists anywhere about the relationship and/or collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg. i simply can't get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film. does any additional information on the subject actually exist? finally, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and i had hoped there would've been a sequel by now. does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition, or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel?

as an avid reader of clive barker, i truly anticipated this film prior to it's release... i was not let down. "nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror, yet showing us the other side of the coin. here the "monsters" are the hideously beautiful beings, while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence. we soon learn that we were wrong all along. by far my favorite performance by the often under-used craig sheffer, and the added bonus of david cronenberg as "decker" is a cast best seen then believed. the "monsters" are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of english creature masters, whom many also brought the "cenobites" to life in "hellraiser", including "pinhead" himself doug bradley. "nightbreed" is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who needs just a little (something) more out of their horror story. this is clive barker at his finest.

i enjoyed this film. the way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. plus, david cronenberg as philip k. decker was great! it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except for the killings of course).i was impressed with the creatures for this film, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget, the mutants/creatures/monsters looked great, especially from 1990. this is definitely a unique film and not crap. it makes me want to go find a read the novella it's based off of. this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are the one with humanity.

i just watched nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and while i remember liking it at the time, i don't remember being blown away by it like i was today. i really can't complain about anything in this movie. craig scheffer is excellent as the lead character of boone. i never understood why he hasn't had a more successful career, because most of his early work is outstanding. as good as scheffer is, cronenberg is even better. his portrayal of the psycho dr. decker is unforgettable, and steals the show. the rest of the cast, which includes doug bradley is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff. the visuals are good, and in some shots great. the danny elfman composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work. the ending was epic, with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes. overall, nightbreed is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker, and ranks as my favorite of his movies, just slightly ahead of hellraiser. 9/10

why didn't critics like this movie?? i don't get it. this is easily my favorite clive barker effort. "hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, "lord of illusions" doesn't move at all!!! i have loved barker's writing for years, especially his "books of blood". terrifically entertaining. he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king. he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. i love love love love it. i also realize , however, that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. and fantasy just isn't my bag. puts me right to sleep. always has. i also think barker works best with short stories. his novels tend to wander a bit. that was my experience when trying to read "the damnation game". it started out well. then 100 pages in i thought "where is this going?" because it wasn't going anywhere.i read "cabal" (the book nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. i especially like the elaboration on decker's character. the way the mask talked to him and controlled him. i like the way barker simply presents it. black and white. there it is. he gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable. when asked why decker kills he says (simply) "because i like it". probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point.but i actually liked the film nightbreed better than cabal. i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films. adore it. i think it is just beautiful. lord of illusions had some of this as well. some of the drawings in the beginning, during the nightbreed credit sequence. it's like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the nightbreed world. i'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist.nightbreed is also (i think) barker's most entertaining film. it moves very quickly. well edited. it doesn't drag like lord of illusions does a little bit. very quick. everything in it is just perfect. it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. that mask is frightening. i'd be curious to know if barker designed that as well. it's not just a hokey jason or "scream"-type mask. something about it is really disturbing.anyway, this is a great flick. definitely check it out if you haven't seen it. highly recommended. one of my favorite horror films of all time. in my opinion clive barker's best. it is scary and violent though, be warned

if you're looking for an original horror flick, this might be the one for you. it's strange and at times lingers on stupidity, but it's just such a good looking, nice sounding and original movie, it never fails, except maybe during the over long climax. "nightbreed" is a must see for horror fans, or for fans of monster movie make-up.boone (craig sheffer) has been having dreams of a town called midian full of mutant creatures. in therapy, his psychiatrist dr. decker (horror director david cronenberg) has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer, and gives him hallucinogenic pills, and tells him to turn himself in. after almost getting killed, boone ends up at the hospital, where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about midian, and tells boone where to go. midian, located in a graveyard, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let boone in. after escaping with only a nasty bite, boone is shot dead by the police, who were lead to his location by dr. decker. but boone isn't dead. the bite causes him to live, and he goes off to midian. meanwhile, boone's girlfriend lori (anne bobby) tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this. when dr. decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues.the plot seems long and complicated, but it really isn't hard to understand. the plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. the make-up effects are astounding. the creatures look unique and amazing, and make this a very appealing film. to add to more senses appeal, we have a musical score by danny elfman, that is both lush and bouncy, and fits the film like a glove. the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully. the cinematography is lovely, and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken. even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great, menacing performance as the man, who for one reason or another, wants to see boone dead. it's odd for a horror film to be this well done.the problems with the movie...well there are a few, but the positives outweigh the negatives. the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor, but almost every one falls flat. the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted, but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera. the worst part of the film would have to be the climax. it takes so long, and is just constant chaos. it's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots, to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about.overall, this movie is amazing to look at. it's a well done horror film, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in character's lines, and a messy climax. nonetheless, this is one to check out.my rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. r for strong violence and language.

adapting his own novel "cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outré horror and fantasy. craig sheffer plays boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. the cops gun him down in front of midian, on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society. when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including boone's sweet girlfriend (the very cute anne bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a most enjoyable david cronenberg)."nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don't see in movies all that often. for one thing, ralph mcquarrie, an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three "star wars" entries, helps barker to create excellent visuals for "nightbreed", starting right away with the opening credit sequence. the visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. it's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. and of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions.great supporting performances add to the fun. cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while charles haid is a fine love-to-hate-him type of antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. doug "pinhead" bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. hugh ross is great fun as narcisse, as is catherine chevalier as rachel (as an added bonus, she bares her breasts in one sequence). simon bamford, who played the "butterball cenobite" in the first two "hellraiser" pictures, turns up here as well. there's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci-fi star john agar.danny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores, and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown."nightbreed" is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it. i give it a hearty recommendation.9/10

nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie, i've worn more than one tape as it is. the make-up is awesome, the story is lovely. it takes a few different twists and isn't quite as deep as the story it's based on (cabal, by clive barker) but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material. the only problem with this movie were the producer's vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie, hence the changed ending to allow for sequels *eye rolls*. apparently someday we're going to be getting a director's cut that will (i hope) clear up this bit of nonsense. until then, i'd suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddy/jason/micheal type slashers. i really don't know what would be comparable...

don't ask me why i love this movie so much...maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it is the amazing monster effects, maybe because i enjoyed the novel "cabal", but it's probably because i love clive barker. i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end. at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons. the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it. the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the "button face/mask" decker character. this is a movie about the monsters! about fantasy! about a place called midian! it's a story where the monsters are the good guys. there is truly nothing else out there like it! it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive's many great works. sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian - where the monsters are.

nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other barker's movies, which never lack originality. an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. for the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references. certainly a lot of fun to have, a a bit to think about, if one cares to. and, not to forget, a nice music score. well, the special effects, as usual, get old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. i've just seen it again after ten years, and i still find it something to recommend.

a lot has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the noise i just want to say a few words on the two female actors.it has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star, in a sense, versus the spectacular monica bellucci, but romane bohringer pulls it off to sensational ends. a film starring monica bellucci where i fall in love with the other girl?? that's not supposed to happen.it's been said a thousand times, but monica bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema. i have never before seen such innate sadness. she would not be out of place breaking lon chaney's heart.

since the plot like vertigo or brian depalma's obsession, till to the score by peter chase that reminds the sounds of bernard herrmann, this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. remarkable playing by romane boeringer and vincent cassel in a bohemian paris portrayed from the famous thierry arbogast. a little cult! it is a pity that the only version available on dvd are the french one and the english. directed by a controversial artist as gilles mimouni, it could be considered a little homage to the cinema masterworks. it is a french movie, and as all of them, not for all, we could say a d'essai cinema. even if not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reason.

all credit to writer/director gilles mimouni who fashioned this winding, twisting tale of deceit and betrayal. while keeping the utmost control, he maintains the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on. even his clever denouement has you guessing.the three central performances are also top class, with vincent cassel, romane bohringer and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. jean-phillippe ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role. to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair.thierry arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma, and cardine biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script.many may say gilles mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love. for me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. only the french are capable of such tantalisation. hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending.monday, march 2, 1998 - hoyts croydonno-one does thriller quite like the french. when they get it right, they really get it right.vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max, romane bohringer obsessive as the new lisa, and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa. the plot from gilles mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires.all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot, and the performances from the three leads. as lucien, jean-phillippe ecoffey is strong and emotional.friday, january 15, 1999 - video

this is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships: playboys (max), manipulative women (alice) and the fools who may be indeed in love (lisa, muriel and lucien).max and alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark. but as the profusely discussed ending tells us, as veteran players as max and alice were, they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself. lisa, muriel and lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship, only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers (as far as what we were shown is concerned....who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen).this is a very fast-paced, delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast. it also deserves some deeper thinking: how much is real in a game of relationship?

i just saw this film again, i believe for the sixth time. i will doubtless see it many more times. this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made. although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, gilles mimouni. for ten years he has not made another film, and this was his only one. the story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly paying homage continually to both hitchcock and buster keaton. the split-second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on keaton in 'steamboat bill junior', and he is only not killed by inches. in this film, people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares, and if they had been one second off, they would have collided. the storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, or you will miss something crucial. the haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by peter chase is reminiscent of hitchcock's 'vertigo', and the whole film has the same eerie quality, but whereas hitchcock had one woman be two women, mimouni has two women be one woman, thereby inverting the plot structure. there are passing references to other hitchcock films, but it is 'vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this film. the theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. that is why it is so easily transferable from lisa to alice, when it is realised that it is alice who is more mysterious than lisa, and it is alice who truly embodies the eternal mystery. the film is ultimately 'made' by romane bohringer. she is so fascinating that she outshines monica bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that bellucci is a knockout beauty, whereas bohringer is what the english call 'plain'. however, romane bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the art of 'personality dominance', whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because romane is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls, and you end up only thinking of her. most of us remember, i'm sure, her father richard bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film 'diva' many years ago. i would rather watch romane than richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating, because richard bohringer is spellbinding too, and he isn't even a woman. romane looks as if she may turn into anna magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an oscar, if someone can only write another 'rose tattoo' for her. the girl has so much passion inside her, she could set the seine on fire. wouldn't it be wonderful if she and julie delpy teamed up? this film made wonderful use of paris locations. but where is this 'square in the luxembourg'? it looked like place furstenburg to me. maybe i missed something. i must watch the film another six times, just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom, and make sure i've got it right. the whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster. how thrilling it all is! romane, you can look through my window anytime! mimouni, come on over, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikelihoods, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible. and once again, we have here the spirit of breton's novel 'nadja' embodied in a great french work of art. more! more! more!

apartmente'l is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen. i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite. that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. as of now i haven't rewatched the movie and i don't think i will.the story follows the experiences of a man, max, who is engaged to be married to muriel. he remembers his old girlfriend lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to lisa talking on the telephone. thus he tries to find lisa. here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa. there are many layers to this movie. there are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion. the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. the main character, max, has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect. i don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice.the character of alice is even worse. her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, i guess). the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character. it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. in the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. the ending lends a cynical touch. because it seems as if max's love for alice is temporary and fake. it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e lisa or alice). in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way).the performances deserve high praise. vincent cassel as max gives a great performance. he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. but the real star of the movie is romane bohringer as alice. her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max. the scene where she screams "i am a nutcase too" really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her.btw i also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. alice's actions can be explained in many ways. and her unreasonable obsession with lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. it may be far-fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend. she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time. that may lead many to question her sexual orientation.overall i would give it a 9/10. i think it deserves it but i subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. i think it is a perfect movie otherwise.

this sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters. so, there are a lot of flashbacks, of re-shooting of the same scene. but, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result! and it would worth it, because it's for me, just one the best french movie ever made! it has everything: cast: first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel! such a presence and such voices, even for a hard-of-hearing! it's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie!directing: his camera is bright, alive, plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close-up "à la david lynch".cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love!a never-seen before paris: it's a paris out-of-time of more accurately, a composite of a lot of districts! huge search here! it's look like gotham city, modern and old at the same time! music: not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames. and the song of charles aznavour made me discover this great singer! ah,  the story! as i said, it's a love story but rather tragic: saying that love can be for nothing, that it doesn't make all people happy or isn't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn't often told! love is passion, which is derivative from the latin "pain". you can suffer a lot when you are in love! because of the why .. ?, of the endless waiting, the lack of courage, the indecision. and when you can ease yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back , just because you arrive too soon or too late, and above all, because love means 2 in a world of billions! a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! so, what's love? personally, i lived some moments like this: in a car with the dear one. her mobile rings and you know it's her "special friend" whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together). so, you want to go out of this car to leave them together, to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't, because an amazing hard rain just started! i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else!

when i watched l'appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "how complicated!" and she is right, of course. when you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero vs crook schemes, l'appartement is hard to follow. a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points. other whine about the confusing flash backs. come on! this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes.the first 3/4 of the movie centers about the question: why did max and lisa split? the film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. having experience with french movies, i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right. in the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that max and lisa were manipulated by alice. max did not know, that lisa had left and why. lisa did not know, why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to paris. the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut.after both max and lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can alice's manipulations be undone? well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed.many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy. there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. l'appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. in the first half alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure.acting is simply great. vincent cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. monica belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. jean paul ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. romane bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret.the only reason i did not gave it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfying end. of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. after all the events max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. alice has paid for her sins. but still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. max too easily exchanges lisa for alice; alice too easily decides to reject max, who has been her dream for so long; max too easily returns to his fiancée. but then again, i don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. i guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.

a wonderful story about the consequences of obsessive love with the beautiful romantic back streets of paris as its location. we're transported through time and see the plot develop from the perspectives of the three main characters as the mystery unwinds.

i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before...there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special. this film is one of them. a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in romane and monica. while monica is very beautiful, romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits.i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters' own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched. like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation. americans make brilliant films, but not of this type... perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english version...for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. for those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like this...i would describe this as neo-franco-noir, but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist. i think i saw him doing an add for four-and-twenty-pies. he thinks romane bohringer is a type of french mayonnaise...it is arty in the way that pulp fiction is arty...but with more gallic savoire faire...10 out of 10 with every viewing...and has anyone got romane's phone number...she is the perfect french salad dressing...

forget the recent dire american remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the french original by virtue of the director's involvement in both. this is a deftly- drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns. it works best as a gallic ode to hitchcock's rear window, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay. the story is stunningly realized, like a picasso painting, offering multi-perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer's participation throughout. the settings, music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast. watch it more than once.

this is a fabulous film. the plot is a good yarn, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. what was deliberate, and what was coincidence? who is in love with who? you get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth. with a bit of effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people. take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen. more than keeping you guessing, the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - i defy anyone to predict! but more likely you will need more than one viewing - i saw this at the pictures on its original release three times, and it got better each time. the acting was very good, with a standout performance by romane bohringer as alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble. a classic. the second-best film of the 1990s.

"l'appartement" has to be among the best french films i have ever seen (along with "hatred", also starring vincent cassel, and those great gerard dépardieu/pierre richard movies). cassel and bellucci are amazing in the leading roles. aside from "brotherhood of the wolves" and "dobermann" i have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple. "l'appartement" sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end. fragment storytelling really hasn't worked this well since "pulp fiction". let's just hope there won't be a godawful american remake of this unique romance/mystery-thriller. (edit: guess what! a godawful american remake has been made!)!

this is an astonishing film: a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs. everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. this is a story told in light, in colour, in many almost-parallels. every time i watch it, it fills me with delight.the acting is great too. romane bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine; but no less excellently: shifty and sympathetic at the same time. and monica bellucci - ah!, monica bellucci, well, put simply, she plays (is?) the world's most perfect woman. there's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile; yet in that instant, says more than hours of hollywood junk.one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement, the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story. yet when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so deftly, that on reflection it makes you gasp. only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point. but the confidence is justified. cinema doesn't come much better than this.

on the outside, this film is better because of vincent d'onofrio (law & order: criminal intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version. in some ways, the 1999 version is better because it's more up to date (a decade as compared to the 27 years. the actors in this film were great, like terry kinney (mcmanus of hbo's "oz") as james daly and tony shalhoub (usa's monk) and gary sinise (csi:ny). obvilubuly, dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences, nut much of the writing remained the same. there were stuff that wasn't in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy, but in the end, this film was just as great at the 1982 one. character-wise: vincent d'onofrio playing phil romano was excellent, better that paul sorvino. it's a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james. as for george, i would praise shalhoub. and between martin sheen & sinsise as tom, i would say sinise wins.

this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. there are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach's house) that are really used. it's primarily at the coach's house, however. a movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. one is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. one wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. one wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. one is a traveling alcoholic.first off, i love the actors in this film. they've all been household names to me. they proved their worth here.one of the most pivotal moments is when tom, played by gary sinise, blows up on the coach. he yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. his blows the coach's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - "forgive me father, for i have sinned!" it's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them.

this movie is based on a play, and is the second adaptation of this work. paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago. they have all met for a reunion. terry kinney plays james, a junior high principal, and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role. vincent d'onofrio, as phil, plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of "money" cockiness. tony shalhoub is george, the current mayor of the town, and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown. gary sinise plays tom, a writer, turned alcoholic, and in my opinion, is excellent in the role. while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship, conflicts, jealousy, and fighting abound. as the men come to terms with what was, and is now, they are forced to look at their lives in a non-pleasant way. it's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been, and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other. it's not the best movie i've seen, but it's certainly good enough for a viewing.

this is a great example of very none hollywood film making which is very thought provoking, moving and not without a sense of humor, kevin mckidd and paula sage are superb. i actually watched it on late night tv and i can see why i missed it in the cinema, its not the sort of film that the multi-screen "mega" cinemas show nowadays, mores the pity. i am going to look for the dvd. not for those who prefer, the current trend towards special effects and no story. if you liked the best selling book "the curious incident of the dog in the night-time", you'll enjoy this film. this film ranks beside the best of scottish films, such as "small faces" and "trainspotting". all films which kevin mckidd also star in. highly recommended.

not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sage's touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline. this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special.(7/10)

a very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. sound a bit too heavy? it is a little, but this is all treated in a realistically straight forward way within a story of the changes that take place to the family who have to deal with these things. this is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isn't overwhelm by the subject matter.afterlife is beautifully shot and crafted film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues. it is a character driven, enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances.unfortunate it is not the sort of film that always performs well at the box office, so catch it while you can.

i agree with andy, this is a good movie. kevin mckidd's character is believable throughout the film. we're forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him. paula sage who plays roberta puts in a good performance too. it's thought-provoking and emotive without any slush over-production. credit to director alison peebles and writer andrea gibb for that. a very worthwhile viewing. the pace of the film is just right, raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in, rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style. nice little soundtrack to go with the film too, again used sparingly, not to distract you from storyline. recommended.

the film's subject is poignant and very real. it happened. one can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter. the subject is what makes the film tick--nothing else. i saw the film for the first time after the real phoolan, was gunned down in new delhi and had served several years as an elected member of parliament in india. by the way, she was not the first untouchable elected to parliament, as some reviewers stated. the so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the indian parliament for decades in reserved constituencies.while shekhar kapur as a director is a hero to many india, because he made commercially accepted international films---"bandit queen" and "elizabeth" (and a tolerable kiddie movie called "mister india", which was accepted by the average indian audiences)---and even got oscar nominations for elizabeth, i do not place him as a top notch film director from india. he fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above-average performances from his actors. subtlety, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films--melodrama brims in them.his idea of using nusrat fateh ali khan's vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film, was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of "bandit queen". and then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence. otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them. if you are looking for a good living indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality--it is not shekhar kapur's movies you should see; it is the later works of three indian film-makers adoor gopalakrishnan, mrinal sen, and girish karnad and of course muzaffar ali's "umrao jaan". it is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership. for instance, sen's "oka oorie katha" made in telugu, or satyajit ray's "sadgati" based on munshi prem chand's "kafan" are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in india. sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them. of course, sen's nugget did not make headlines, while kapur's effort hogged them.to kapur's credit, he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences. for that effort, i salute kapur. but "bandit queen" will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it.

irrespective of the accuracy of facts, bandit queen is a true story, its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994. this movie is violent, powerful and thought provoking.the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood, whose adversity brought out the best(or worst) out of her. keeping the subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that phoolan's character from a young girl of 8, who is married off by her father to clear a debt(pun intended), to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste, has evolved into a champion in her own right. her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre.i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, bandit queen needs to be 'studied' in the indian context, and not just checked out in stereotypes. i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience, its a shame that the movie had a delayed, overtly censored release in india.bandit queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india, being a woman and that too a lower caste, her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life, which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess. she responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be. call it divine justice or judiciary failure, had she killed a single person she would have been hanged, she killed 24 and got revered, respected and glorified.p.s # whoever found her character "psychotic", needs to be sodomized at 8, gangraped by 10 men at a go and paraded naked. then they should be asked- how normal do they feel?

i saw bandit queen in 2005, over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in india. the language, the stark treatment and the natural acting (by a relatively unknown cast for that time) might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema. the film, the cast, and shekhar kapoor, deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort.the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india. in fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. the reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this, and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen, and survived to tell the tale. survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. phoolan devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994.the film scores on several counts. the cinematography is brilliant. the music is apt. the cast, many of whom became more familiar names later, is very good. but the screenplay is patchy. things move too fast and in jerks at times. it's understandable though, because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive. or maybe i felt that because i have read mala sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though obviously not as shocking as the visual, account of phoolan devi's travails, and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film.there are some factual ambiguities too. according to phoolan devi, she wasn't present when the behmai massacre took place, and despite claiming to be the dictated account of phoolan herself, she is shown to participate, and in fact initiate, the massacre. then the final scene where phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the chief minister, while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of mahatma gandhi. symbolic value only, but shows that phoolan didn't want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to arjun singh, who many remember was the cm of madhya pradesh then.but these are small chinks in this eminently well-made movie, a rare gem to come out from the mainstream indian film industry, made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80s - mr india.

i think that the movie was really good. subject, acting and nusrat fateh ali khan's music were marvellous. although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.

this is an excellent movie. phoolan had no role model's to base her actions on, yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment. i like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up, it added to the horror of the story, & the triumph.

it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and, when she did finally see parts of it, was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself. i do not know whether it was shown at all or not, but given her standing at the time as a rising politician, i doubt it. since then, i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days, and has gone into hiding as a result.her own concerns aside, this is an excellent film, made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach; none of the rose-tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film. it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant: it's a true story. her misgivings are, it seems, not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her.

the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team!one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom! all appearing in this short are dee green, the beautiful christine mcintyre, doris houck, alyn lockwood, johnny kascier, nancy saunders, and emil sitka. green and mcintyre provide great performances here! there are so many funny parts here. this is a very hilarious short. there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both!

there are one or two other shemp-era shorts i like more (i.e. scrambled brains), but i think one can say--without much argument--that in this particular episode, shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946.scene for scene, this episode hardly lets up: from professor shemp howard's voice lessons with the glass-shattering dee green, to his futile attempts to win a dame's hand in marriage (this is your little snookums... will you marry me *click*) to the uproarious finish, it never fails to keep me in stitches.i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins (the always lovely christine mcintyre). btw, isn't she rather under-dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her 'cousin' basil? who knows, maybe the actual basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as i know). >:-]

this the the final feature film that michelangelo antonioni directed, with the help of wim wenders, and adapts from his short story collection "that bowling alley on the tiber". beyond the clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be accustomed to from his earlier works, and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via wenders' directed scenes involving john malkovich's the director character. however, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an antonioni movie, while malkovich's narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place.nonetheless, all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters, and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight, perhaps due to the lack of time (since they're short stories anyway) to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie. and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship?the first story, story of a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between silvano (kim rossi stuart) and carmen (ines sastre), who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel, and later meet at a cafe. it's as if fate is playing games on them when they meet, but part and meet again much later, but like the games people play, it's almost like a l'avventura or a la notte with the lack of communication, and of the expectations from the man.john malkovich's director character takes central role in the next short, who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop, played by sophie marceau. she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable, but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him, and in what i thought was to scare him off, tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics.the next short, don't look for me, is the longest of the lot, with peter weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress (chiara caselli) or his wife, played by fanny ardant. perhaps the more star studded of the lot, with jean reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it, which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists. but unfortunately reno's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements. there was a key element adapted from l'eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too, while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting. if there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon, it'll be the duplicity of man.in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la notte, marcello mastroianni and jeanne moreau, where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert. finally, we have the final shot this body of dirt, with vincent perez as a young man going after a girl (irene jacob) whom he just met, and falling in love with her, only to realize that it is a love that is too late. it's a relatively talkie piece, just like the first story, with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in, which sort of brings to mind richard linklater's before sunrise.while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces, they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the "excuse" to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film.

even though the story is light, the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie.the film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspect of attraction between man and/or woman and how it frequently is ethereal. their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto, it will flow out like a handful of sand.i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more the man desires her. it parallels her deep love for god, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart.a very good movie. 7/10

i saw this film for the first time last night. i have been thinking about it all night and this morning. i cannot say that it was my favorite film, at least not yet. i need to see it again. the cinematography is stunning. each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has wim wenders's name attached to it.it is always tempting to see de chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom, but in this case the analogy fits. in many ways the figure of malkovich walking through the fog and wind of ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts milan in the major works of the italo-greek painter. he is slightly menacing, a presence who watches and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence on the entire story. the dedicated wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of damiel and cassiel wandering through the streets of berlin, watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. and, following the himmel uber berlin metaphor, the angel (or in this case malkovich the director) gets to interact with one of the stories. at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. i need to see the movie again. i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring malkovich's monologue together. perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. maybe that is the whole point of it. no one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.we must be careful when throwing around the word "pretentious." it is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension, but that leads to a terrifying mental state, one in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthy or authentic is the most banal. when we shun all discussions of philosophy, god, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, we are setting our culture up to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. perhaps this is the warning that wenders and antonioni are giving us. it certainly is not the only theme of the film, but i think that it cannot be ignored.the other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. there is a lot here on that, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.my advice is to see the film. but i offer a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least i don't think so yet). some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film. par-dela les nuages is one of those films.

i was stunned by this film. i have been renting antonioni's films/rediscovering them, and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his 50 years of directing. what an eye for setting, color, and detail! i have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. i had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. yes, beauty moves me, like it moved keats to write ode on a grecian urn. this movie is made for the mature, emotionally and intellectually, audience. those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. i will have to see this film several times before i can truly appreciate it and judge it. this film should be required viewing for all cinematographers and directors.possibly a truly great film, on the order of kurosawa's dreams.

beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen. not for its cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni, one of italy's most famous directors. however, if you gave this film only a quick watch-over, passively i mean, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. this movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. by cheese i don't mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! the music seems like it's from some italian porno, the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.but once you get passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. the basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate to each other. instead they can only communicate through each other. i suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic.i left that film thinking to myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. i hate, because i have reason. but what does the hated think? maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. in other words, melodramatic.so melodrama is actually an existential function. a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.this is a great film, i recommend it to all!

i'm not really sure what to make of this movie, especially after seeing a great film like la notte. unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the frankfurt film museum, so i didn't get to hear malkovich's great voice. he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy. however, as good an actor as he is, malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby. then the two of them go home, have sex, and he leaves. it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films (like the passenger) when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity.however nonsensical the storyline is, the film features two things that make it watchable: eye and ear candy. the actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is marvelous - scenes in old italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of la notte).the ear candy, however, is what really makes the film worth watching. u2 and brian eno collaborated on "your blue room" and "beach sequence," both of which set the mood perfectly in the film. the songs are available on "passengers: original soundtracks 1."

i was stunned by this film. afterwards, i didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.for many, it may be the worst of antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.but for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.

this is a special film if you know the context. antonioni, in his eighties, had been crippled by a stroke. mute and half paralyzed, his friends -- who incidentally are the best the film world has -- arranged for him to 'direct' a last significant film. the idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it. so we have a film: about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. and the matter of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love.the film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination. the result is pure movie-world: every person (except the director) is lovely in aspect or movement. some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. there is no nuance, no hint that anything exists but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create.i know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see. he understands something about not touching. no one understands van morrison visually like he does. morrison's celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion: the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch.antonioni's redhead wife appears, appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster 'making of' film that is on the dvd.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 4: worth watching.

i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality. it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen, though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial - too much beautiful, if you will. anyway, one thing is for sure - the camera man has done a great job - each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art, comparable to the chirico's or bernard buffet's paintings.the music forms a perfect background for the story, especially u2's one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene. as for the casting - i cannot be objective since i like sophie marceau and jean renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others.however, the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in cinema) criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time. no doubt, the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous. but this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film. the second novel (when sophie marceau tells her story to malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved - was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked marceau or what?). apparently, it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot.other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot, which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them. the scene when jean reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible. the feeling of moist air and fine haze, which is being spread by the first "ferrera" scene can literally be sensed through the screen. no doubt, antonioni is a great master of shades and semi-shades. my favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - i guess that it the most antonioni-like one in the whole movie - almost a parable.probably, the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small ghotic italian town, with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements, fountains with the l'eau potable and monumental cathedrals... it was laconic but really touching.i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie, however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it (it works better with the home theater, having somebody caring by your side, than in the movie theater). enjoy.i beg your pardon for the imperfect english and any possible misspellings

here's another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd. i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in metropolitan movie capital l.a.!)for a couple of weeks and then disappeared (art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory, where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities).at first i was disappointed, thought the pace to be unbearably boring, and that the man had lost a chance (for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financing)at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon; but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blow-up and the passenger, i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again. i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in, making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life, driving home, in a contemporary setting, points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in 'l'aventurra,' forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone (and quite comedic actually) that i couldn't get enough. the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach, with the weather so beautifully silver skied, and the eno/u2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm, had been my favorite; it still was, but now the whole film was just as great! what a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate. the odd thing is, though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you, this film is unmistakably antonioni's to its core, but you will not sense to what a profound extent, until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm. for example, it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor, something i did not notice at first, but was turned on to by another critic, and noticed to much delight on further viewings (4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more). if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it, i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonioni's '60s films. but the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version (if and when it's released). i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'beyond the clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.

beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful, elegiac work of art. the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in, makes you want to touch the screen. the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. or, to put it another way, an old man. i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds. nearly all the people in this film are beautiful, unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. the dialogue doesn't really matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. some films exist just as visual experiences, this is one of them. don't bother if you want "simple entertainment",this not for you. i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but i won't. if you are at all interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc., watch this film.

like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned. we had good reason to do so, the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu, dark waters, juon - the grudge, and a tale of two sisters. by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead. now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made, the likes of marebito and shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day. but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed! then along comes a film like noroi - the curse. a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots, yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it. what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all. the film is a documentary about one of japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on. he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son. these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. a psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit. the film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line. the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences. if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere. the film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it. the climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer. in terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. you get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film. the film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.overall, noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night. not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film. it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin. just let yourself go to this one completely. and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight?? no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan, let alone had an american remake lined up yet. check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!

another hand-held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about.imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie. it's another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared.i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie (does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends?) but the creepy moments, the genuinely creepy moments, were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped. i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared throughout so i certainly can't recommend this as highly as [*rec].having said that, it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down.check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand-held genre releases of late. and the finale is a hair-raising doozy.see this if you like: the last broadcast, pulse, angel heart.

a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the "kagutaba."from the looks of it, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months, even one that's going to be released next week (paranormal activity)! however, unlike movies like cloverfield, rec, and blair witch, where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness, this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. it has tv excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle, well, excluding the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously.and it works. the film is very engrossing and it makes you think. yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when, in course of the film, these things start to intertwine one another. the film is also very slow moving, which, in this case, is a good thing. we, as the audience, get to absorb the details shown on screen, however subtle or blatant they are.above all, it's a frightening little film. i'm a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes, the film gave me some nightmares. there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch, including one closer in the end where it makes you go "what am i looking at?!" well, it's better left unanswered. there are around ten reoccurring characters in here, all of which gave authentic performances in their roles.the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered. the question "that's it?" went though my mind. it left a bad taste in my mouth. however, the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening. don't see this alone in the dark because you'll regret that choice. also, i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film. that will be interesting.

i, for one, absolutely loved this movie.it is not a "typical asian horror" where you would see a gruesome looking ghost (usually a woman) that is going around scaring people. you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius. this is not the movie for you if you're into gore (e.g. saw, hostel) or "surprise scares" where stuff pops out at you (hollywood horror, slasher films), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout the entire movie which i loved. noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society.please don't let the documentary-style of filming turn you off (why should it?!). it is far superior to the blair witch project because, for one, the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing.noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror; and this movie holds a solid #1 spot on my list.

being a great fan of horror, especially asian horror, i have seen tons of movies, but this one is outstanding. why? it does have a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). the actors did a good job. it feels like a real documentary film (even if it's not). it does not get boring for a moment. the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still, it's believable). it reminded me of the similarly great movie "forbidden siren".to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character hori, the psychic, but this is subjective.i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror.9 out of 10.

i can't praise this film enough. it had a lot of that hand-held, first-person shaking camera which i love (and some hate, because it makes them sick), like rec, cloverfield and blair witch project.it is a long movie for its kind, but i didn't even notice because the film was so interesting. by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter's work the movie keeps up the pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer.while i would never call this film the "scariest horror ever made", i'd have to say it's certainly one of the best i've seen. the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images, camera glitches, events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie. the horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imaginations. the ending is perfect, and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards. a second viewing is highly recommended, though.watch this one alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.

noroi follows a documentary filmmaker, masafumi kobayashi, as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake. after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby's cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. he's greeted with hostility by the unhinged, disheveled woman (maria takagi) who answers the door (and promptly slams it in his face) and gets a peek at her 6-year-old son through a window. strangely, both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. this piques kobayashi's interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on. he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic. well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant, and tv celebrity, kana (rio kanno) seems to think we may all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. another female psychic/actress (marika matsumoto) becomes involved, as does mr. nori, a mentally unstable kook/psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to "ectoplasmic worms." clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as kagutaba...unlike many other hand-held horror flicks, this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first-person scares. thankfully there's something of a storyline here, a very interesting and intricate one at that, so it doesn't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera-work every once in awhile to keep your interest. the way masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing. the film also doesn't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian, but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary. that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the 'actual' footage either. overall, it's a well-made horror film, with lots of plot shifts, some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments, that's well worth checking out. my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long. otherwise, pretty good stuff.

this review contains some small, yet significant, spoilers.---i just finished watching my copy of noroi......and it was great! this might sound cheesy, but several times during the film i forgot it wasn't real xd the acting is convincing, although the acting from masafumi kobayashi (playing himself, i think...) seems a bit hokey at times. marika matsumoto (yuka in takashi shimizu's rinne) seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie: sometimes she's really good, then the next moment she's really cheesy (especially at the end's exorcism and subsequent re-possession.a character that was ridiculous at first was mr. hori, a man covered in tinfoil believing "ectoplasmic worms" are coming to eat everyone. he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning (acting like the stereotypical alien abduction-type victim) but near the end has some really creepy scenes.the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together. there are some things that aren't really explained (like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutaba-boy came from) but everything else turned out fine. the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving, if not the scariest, sequences i've ever had the pleasure to witness.all in all, noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong r3 dvd provides great picture and sound (most importantly the english subtitles- engrish free!) for a great j-horror experience. i highly recommend picking it up.

never posted anything here before, but after watching noroi i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it.firstly do not compare this to blair witch, this movie deserves far better than that! simply put, noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies i have ever seen (and i have seen a lot!).i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (i think?) named kobayashi and his cameraman. without spoiling to much about the plot, i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister.while the story might not be that original in itself, what really hooked me with noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. if you're looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes this movie might not be for you. this movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense. the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable.this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! far better than in most other movies in this type of genre.well enough ranting from me, i highly recommend noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, creepy, well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.

anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all. some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (e.g., a tale of two sisters, kairo, etc.). whatever the type of horror film one personally likes, there are only a select few that really scare you. noroi is one of them.this is a documentary-style movie, which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named kagutaba. the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with kagutaba, then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research. what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is fake.some have compared noroi with the blair witch project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. one obvious difference between the films is that noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources. for example, the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch. later in the film, a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange occurrence. the viewer's memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine. another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one. in fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. later on, however, that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. this is intelligent film-making indeed.another difference between noroi and blair witch is that noroi provides not one, but two very long finales, the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema. i do not say such things lightly. it totally wrecked me in a wonderous way.other aspects of film-making are well done. the legend and ritualistic background of kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. the only over-the-top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's expected. the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders. japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were awesome. in some cases they create an other-worldly feel (e.g., the static interference or the first finale) but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (e.g., the second finale).when all is said and done, noroi goes down as the scariest film i've ever seen. i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like noroi does. see it now.

www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html an excellent tv series that should be captured on dvd. this was a show i rarely missed. i found a petition to bring it back on dvd. i recall one show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her. needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death. another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer & subway security branch. the accountant wanted to shut down the funding for the project. as it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html

one reasons why they call the 80's, "the awesome 80's" is quality television. shows like the wonder years, war of the worlds (the series), v, amazing stories, and many more have always left an impression to each "fortunate" one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. to top that, here comes monsters! a series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. may it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.if you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. provided you can find this rare gem. even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it's indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. i guarantee, because i'm 23 :).be sure not to miss this!although, it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...

i think that it's great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation. film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed, they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now. monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining. it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series. this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the 13th, the series, nor as adult oriented as the freddy's nightmares..it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time. i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line-up, i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up.

this was one of the best half-hour horror/suspense/fantasy shows of the eighties, without a doubt. granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode, and it stank as far as production values (i.e. the sets) went, but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots. i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i, a hardened horror movie, shock-film, and 70's grind-house buff got a little sickened and creeped out. great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. my favorite episode was called "bug house", yeah that was the title i think? anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day, almost 20 years after it first premiered. other shows like "tales from the darkside", "the outer limits" and (of course) "the twilight zone" were definitely better production values-wise, but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show! it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was, "tales from the crypt".

this show has to be my favorite out of all the 80's horror tv shows. like tales from the darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. if you agree with me, please sign this petition i started, to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd. here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html some of my favorite episodes would have to be glim glim, and rain dance. i also loved the opening intro with the monster family. that used to creep me out! one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be. i don't know if any of you remember that part but that's one of the main things that brings back memories to me. i mean, come on! war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd, so i say monsters, and also tales from the darkside, and friday the 13th the series should be released too! we the fans need to speak our minds! we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word!!!

this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by daniel boone in the wilderness of cumberland gap while being threatened by hostile indians. a treacherous frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while boone tries to convince the indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace. the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes, although somewhat violent for its time. the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good, especially lon chaney as the indian chief. bruce bennett is okay as boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman. the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods.

i was enchanted by niami's debut. i hope that we'll soon see more of his work. i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours, but with a gentle european whimsey that made it fresh and fun. a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. and i thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy, while peter stormare is hilarious, and ling bai touching. see it.

despite its new york setting & new york characters, 'summer in the city' is not an american movie, it is better than that. what is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. director niami's shows a deft touch in combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama.the secret of niami's success appears to be a smorgasboard of great characters - each could have their own film built around them - and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie, ranging from bai ling to ornella muti, robert burke to peter stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in hollywood pictures. even sandra bernhard is funny here !an added bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is john cale's soundtrack.

this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best. if you want a simple, cute story however, you won't find it here. the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan. a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state.

this film is a very descent remake of the famous fritz lang's masterpiece "m- murder".it is well made and with a entertaining key to speak about pretty serious events and contemporary problems in eurobe but not only the whole world.the ethnic intolerance is such a huge evil and very contagions nowadays. so "children of wax" or as it is known in us distribution reveals the question of german and turk hatred in an amusing way.no doubt it is well appreciated to be taken for distribution by the great weinsten brothers.and there is another fact i liked most is the participation in this movie of the favorite actor of lars von trier the great udo kier who shows to play with such a pleasure for the bulgarian film director ivan nichev.

"children of wax" also shown as "killing grounds" is an interesting mixture of genres. some might think the purity of the genre can be only for good but to me the eclectic symbioses is very entertaining. it is also in it's story the mixture of thriller and the popular action as well as the combination of the historic masterpiece and the ethnic plea for tolerance. this film is built with the starry presence of my favorite actor the perfect armand assante but it is also marked by the acting of a shooting star  hal ozan .we have recently seen him in the tv series on hbo called "sex" . "children of wax" is entertainment for the audience but the same time it has an everlasting moral for the ethnic tolerance. this is a wise way to seminate welfare. discussion on the contemporary troubles of our days can be made with attractive means in this is very positive side of the film "children of wax".

i had such high hopes for teletoon retro to air this but instead of having shows such as this, ones that don't get the treatment that they deserve, they air things that i may have seen dozens of times before.the centurions was the highlight of my pre-teen years. i know that may seem a little bit clichéd but it's true. after duke from g.i. joe, jake rockewell is another one of those cartoon characters that i really had a crush on.it's too bad that teletoon retro doesn't see it the same way people of my generation do. otherwise teletoon retro would be a lot better than it is.

the centurions is one of the best cartoons ever and it needs to be put on tv and dvd so people can have younger generations enjoy such a good show that is far better than the garbage they have made in the last 14 years. i have a petition online that is at the website address http://www.petitiononline.com/6600f/petition.html that originally was trying to get this show on five days a week but is now trying to get this show onto dvd since the tv station it was focused on has bad public relations. we all need to convince the people who own this show to put it on dvd so it can be seen by future generations. also since now hasbro toys owns the toy line of this show we might want to try to convince them to make a live action movie of it just like they have done with transformers and sometime this year g.i.joe. we need good cartoons like this one to come back and be enjoyed by the younger generations. please do sign this petition so we can one day have dvds of the guys who are famous for yelling "power extreme!"

this is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever, maybe the best cartoon of all time. it had everything action, adventure, thrill, and much more...i can't imagine how hard it was for ruby-spears company to make this great cartoon, there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it, for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because i wouldn't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent!the cartoons will never be the same as they were before, that is why i hope that they all will be released on dvd specially the centurions as it's my favorite. i have the whole complete set of 65 episodes on dvd-r but it's not the same because if they were released on dvd the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the dvd's in almost every store which means a lot to the fans. my good friend ted made this petition to either get the show back on tv or better on dvd, that is if we get many requests to get them back on dvd.so please help us by signing the petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600f/petition.html

i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film. i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable. both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out for.the final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen. the kiss was definitely a great payoff, done with great enthusiasm's!! i can only assume that the film was shot on film, and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say.... well deserved.i would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. it brought back some great memories and some scary ones.

i saw this at the tribeca film festival, in the family section. i'm not sure either of my kids really got the movie, but i have to say that it was a wonderful short film.'nostradamus and me' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the 1980's, which in turn, extends to how my kids feel today. then, we had regan, today, we got bush. instead of nuclear war, we have terrorism.i really identified with the main character, and i myself dated a 'curehead' in high school. we all felt like 'nothing mattered' when we were 16, but it's great to see a film where they discover that everything matters!!! again, i probably wouldn't have put this in the family section...there were a few too many curse words for younger children, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch.

the comments of the previous user are harsh indeed. one wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film. as for being so nasty about it in front of the writer/director..well thats just plain rude! for those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced. irish film-making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the spleen venting comment made about this is evidence of it.. as people we have a choice; give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself.. i know which one is easier... do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made... you won't be disappointed

what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway. does is have to be something grisly like 'saw' or it's just crap...??? now, i don't claim to be an all knowing expert, but i'm about 47, i've seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. believe me, i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started, assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised. it's no mamet script, that's for sure; but come on!!! with all the horrible garbage out there, especially in horror, i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most.the director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. the editing and timing were very good. and it didn't resort to the tired, worn cliché of excessive 'slasher' violence; for example ***** minor spoiler ***** during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous (but tasty..., uh, i mean tasteful) nude shower scene i fully expect her to get sliced and diced; but, amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it ***** end minor spoiler ***** also, the tension was built very well, leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what. ***** spoiler ***** especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and pinnochio alone in the office; we see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. also, the mom sees pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty; so, are both the mom and daughter mentally ill...??? also there is the original 'killer' and what the mom had surmised about a possible evil influence. but even with all that, we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing ***** end spoiler ***** so, all in all, i believe that it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create some good ol' early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence. and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason (just the lovely, innocent, beautiful shower scene, which i will remember to the end of my days... : ) compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there, a definite, strong 8/10!!!

(this review contains a huge spoiler, but i don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) i saw "pinoccio's revenge" a while ago.now, you might think it's just a rip-off of child's play. indeed there are similarities.however, chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid. it is possible that pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something. however, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. the kid is insane, and the kid is the one killing people! everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the kid herself thinks it's the doll. but it's the kid.the nudity is almost a pity, because otherwise i could tell everyone to see it, because it really is an interesting horror movie.

i know what you're saying, "oh man, pinochio is not scary!" but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio. behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll pinnochio who seems to talk to her. the only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her. in the end is shocking revelation that, as did i, will shock you. watch it. give it a try.

this movie is the best horror movie i have ever seen. the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks. seriously, if you have little kids don't let them see this. of course i am a little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and midgets. also a body double cameo by the guy who does mini me verne troyer. and some gratuitous nudity, a must in any low budget horror movie. all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book.

perhaps the best movie ever made by director kevin tenney (well, his witchboard is not on the top of my all-time horror list), this one is a strange, fascinating mixture between pin and child's play, both better than this one, but not so better. sure, the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, rosalind allen is very pleasant to the eye (and so is candance mckenzie - god bless her for the shower scene!), the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine. for a b-movie not bad at all.

at first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love, but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have.the first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave.but while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then.one year went by until i saw this movie in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.i saw it once,twice...until 200 times and not kidding.i did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.and i have to say that i'm not used to see a movie more than twice.the act is very good.gerard depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.i would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.on balance,it's a movie i can't take out of my mind.

i can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever!!! if you are in the mood for a comedy, i totally recommend this movie! so, here's the summary. there is this girl(nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years. she expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(ben), who is much older than she is. so, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover. this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and i highly suggest it. so rent it and enjoy!!!

it's one of my favorite movies as much because of the location and music as the story line. don't matter how many times i watch it, it doesn't seem to ever get old. i can almost say all the lines along with the characters now. the movie is supper funny and really sweet.

i love this film, it is excellent and so funny, ben is fit and i wouldn't mind meeting him on holiday!! i rate this film a 10 because its gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same. funny bit is wen andre is looking at the moon,and he shouts at nicole to 'come outside and look at the moon' that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old. another thing is nicole looks a lot older then 14... but shes a gr8 actress. but i need help with something does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen nicole and andre are dancing??? its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song!!

this is one of my all time favourite films. its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest. i always throw on this film if i'm going on holiday, or if i don't want to go to the gym, just seeing nikki's gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need. its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea, but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy, romance and an interesting plot you will love it. it is filled with great characters and ben and nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing. bottom line......you have to give it a try! i watched it on tv one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday. my father the hero i love you!!!

this is one of the best romantic movies i have ever seen. especially girls who can identify with nicole will love it(not only because of the handsome dalton james) i also liked the music very much. a highlight was land of the sea and sun from baha-man. so watch the movie and enjoy it

this is a funny movie, there's not a lot of those. ok, the plot is a bit disturbing, but very original. a teen trying to get even with dad, because he hasn't been around and almost sending him to jail because she lie to impress an older boy, how could that not be funny? plus it not the typical movie featuring teens. first remake i've seen, that is better than the original, the only problem with both: gerard depardieu. with another actor this would be a perfect 10, because he plays all rolls the same way, sucks. another problem it's all the women melting over him, that's not remotely believable, he is not attractive!, y had a rubber troll that was better looking than him, come on!

this is one of my favourite movies ever... i have seen it about a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to watch it again. in fact, i love it so much that i really wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation... does anyone know the name of it? if so, please email me!!! i watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and i was about nikki's age and for the longest time i bugged my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course i expected the same thing to happen to me! it's just such an amazing setting and such a cute puppy-love story. this is a definite dvd collector's must!

this is another case of hollywood arrogance presuming to eclipse french style. the original, mon pere ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in. they did, however, take the precaution of hiring francis veber to write an english version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original. depardieu brings his gallic charm and katherine heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off. the thing is that when the french make a sort of lolita-lite they get away with it because the 'dirty french postcard' thinking works in their favour; here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover), prevailed upon to play and song 'something french', launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls. see the original.

i have a problem with the movie snobs who consider americans to be uncouth semi - literates unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated europeans,les francais,les italiens...just about anybody from le continong to whom english is a foreign language.if the humour in "my father the hero" is different from that in "mon pere ce heros" it is because the french sense of humour is different from that of the american.not better,not "more clever",just different. if you think it is crass for hollywood to "borrow" from the french cinema just consider how much the french cinema has borrowed from hollywood in the first place.where would belmondo and delon have been without bogart?truffaut without hitchcock?jerry lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style is idolised in france.go figure........ monsieur depardieu is exceptionally good as the hapless divorced father of a precocious 14 year old daughter on holiday in the bahamas together. unbeknowst to him,she presents him to the other people at the hotel as her lover so as to make herself more interesting to a boy she has her eye on .not surprisingly,complications ensue. there are "hommages" to "green card" and "cyrano de bergerac" amusingly inserted and m.depardieu goes along with it all very good - naturedly. he does a good maurice chevaler impression with "thank heaven for little girls" which is in fact funny and rather poignant as his audience,all of whom believe him to be the lover of a 14 year old girl,get up and leave two - by - two as he warbles away,blissfully unaware of what is happening.when he turns round at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause the expression on his face is priceless. without him the movie would be very average indeed.with his huge shambling figure dominating the screen it is a lot of fun.no pecs,no six pack - just a real proper human - type being.formidable!

my father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. gerard depardiu is awesome as andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter nicole(kathrine heigl) to the caribbean for vacation.while there, his daughter meets a guy named ben(dalton james. to impress him, she tells him that andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp. everyone on the island is soon under the impression that andre's a child molester. andre is between two relationships. one with isabelle(emma thompson, who makes a cameo in the end of the film) and diana(faith prince from spin city). my father the hero has many funny moments. like when he's at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french. so he plays "thank heaven for little girls" from gigi. everyone gets disgusted and leaves. my father the hero doesn't deserve a 5.1. i think it deserves a 9.0.

i think is a great and a very funny movie. the story is so funny. the daughter nicole brings her father andre, in some very embarrassing situations in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover.you just have to see!! heigl is lovely as nicole, perhaps too lovely; i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone? gerard depardieu acts very great in this comedy film, he is so fun to watch. if you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this!!! i think you can see this film many time, and you will still have a good laugh.in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.

what a great movie this is. i found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl. and it is set in a tropical island 'paradise'as well. gerard depardeiux brings his special european flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl. they are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways. but you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves.there are a few cult classics which all teens should see. this movie should be added to the list. in addition to dirty dancing, ferris bueller's day off, bill and ted's excellent adventure, rocky horror picture show and animal house, my father the hero should be required film study. watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter. watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months.

my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger. it's about andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. but of course, nicole isn't that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i'm guessing. she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. one day at the beach, nicole meets handsome ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. i would give my father the hero 8/10

this is a funny, intelligent and, in a sense, realistic comedy about a 14-year-old trying to live her first love while on vacation, and also about the complex, sometimes amusing, sometimes touching, relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter... and about how far a women (not only nicole, the teen-ager) can go to get the man she loves! i laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags.

i watched this series after tipping the velvet, for which i gave 10/10 grade. i had read user comments on this and i expected an equally good series, or if possible, even better. at this point i must emphasize that this series is good, and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching. however, i didn't enjoy it as much as tipping the velvet, for the following reasons: 1. less passion, love, and related sexual content. there were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements, which i held integral for a love story. fingersmith felt like a watered down version of tipping the velvet.2. similarly, as in tipping the velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part, and the ending. the second part should have been the climax of the story (as in tipping the velvet), but instead it was almost totally skipped, perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content. the series should have been in three parts, featuring two cliffhangers, with a lot more focus on the second part.3. almost no weight was given to what fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. i found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic. 4. the ending was much more hasty than in tipping the velvet. fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open.despite these shortcomings, fingersmith is a good series, and well worth 7/10. however, it is not a classic like tipping the velvet.

based on actual events of 1905, silent film the battleship potemkin concerns an imperial russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.potemkin is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.to describe potemkin as a great film is something of an understatement. it is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

this film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of strike (eisenstein's 1st film). take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending, to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen! a highly intelligent monumental film, a must see for all film students!

eisenstien's "potempkin", (bronenosets potyomkin), is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era. eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day. the odessa steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago. do not pass up the chance to see this film!

this 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship potemkin at the port of odessa. the movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the october revolution of 1917. following his montage theory, eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. the "odessa steps" sequence in potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. the baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in brian d' palma's the untouchables. it is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes.

spoilers every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends. whether the nazi banning of certain leaflets, or the televised chinese alternative of tianamen square, governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time. in 1925 though, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the russian communist government supported the creation of this film, battleship potempkin. a major piece of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day.set aboard the battleship potempkin, the crew are unhappy. in miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. led by grigory vakulinchuk (aleksandr antonov), the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom.as far as propaganda goes, "battleship potempkin" is perfect. presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful soviet tool. eighty years after the films release though, and the ussr has disappeared completely off the map. the amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema.written and directed by sergei eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. it is true, that it is far from what we would nowadays consider 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful piece of art.whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of odessa, everything about this film is perfectly made. the music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the acting, whilst slightly overdone, is perfect for the piece. basically, there is no way to fault this film's end product.it's impossible to know how the russian people received this film upon it's release. praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years, it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. as a piece of art though, it is magnificent. beautiful from start to finish, it is far from an easy watch, but it is well worth the effort.

the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period. eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor's revolt and the massacre at the town. as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of szocialist realism. by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means to spread the message of the revolution. eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite. marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda.

the movie touches the soul of the audience very much,some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically,i'm surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925.as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage.first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is.lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films.and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie.

it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this.the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with - you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens. of course, this film has it's own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.the tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland. things escalate believably and for a film of it's era, it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film.this really is worth sitting through, (that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).

set in the 1794, the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton (gerard depardieu, at his finest) and robespierre (a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak). the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre. he is opposed to "the reign of terror" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the revolution. danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting. but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland. his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union, which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. his previous film "man of iron" (1981) had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski, and that between danton and robespierre. danton/walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre/jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. the film is based on the polish play "the danton affair" written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris.

i saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in india, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were tigers. i came home after watching it, with a glazed look in my eye, wanting to be that bloke in the movie that befriended the tigers. what a movie and what a moment that was! the theatre i saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall. i don't know how i'd feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on dvd or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore. i have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished when one travels life's jaded highways occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past by way of movies, only to find its gushing innocence completely soppy and not welcome anymore. and i do not want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind. i do not have kids, so i probably am being selfish in leaving this movie in a sepia toned area of my brain, not wanting it on dvd. but if you are at a precocious age and want to recollect in later years memories of an endearing childhood, try to watch this film(if you can ever). it'll be really worth it.

if it were possible to award a 10+ .... this would be the one film i would choose.i remember catching this film on tv many, many years ago - and fortunately being prepared enough to video it. now my video copy is getting old, video technology is outdated and i'm starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer.as a wildlife film it is superb. as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since. how can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? if such a thing as a lobby/pressure group exists to push for the re-release of this film, count me in and send me the details pronto.my guess is there's a mint to be made by anyone able to re-release this in today's market.

the feeling of the need to have someone play the role of arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin. it does seem that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types do appear everywhere; be it in one's family, church or bowling league.these are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us; unless, of course, whatever 'it' is does not fly in the face of today's "acceptable" language, mores and general "standards" of "proper" behavior.so it is that these latter day, high tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what was hollywood's greatest achievement; namely their participation in our own allied propaganda via their unselfishly crafted message and theme films.coldly brutal in its generation, the banned code and list of now unacceptable extends into the wartime cartoons that don't meet with the new touchy, feely socially engineered 'official' attitudes; which these "thought police" have foisted down upon us.we were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects. the majority we are aware of are from warner brothers' looney tunes and merrie melodies; featuring bugs, daffy, elmer & porky, all in conflict with hitler, goerring, 'il duce', tojo and the like. surprisingly though, we found an ample supply of cartoons from mgm, walt disney, lantz, paramount-famous studios and the brothers fleischer.you're a sap mr. jap (famous studios/paramount pictures, 1942) is a prime example of just what we're talking about.being virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of the studios of max and dave fleischer before the 1941 business coup-de-tat that moved them out, bringing the new name of "famous" studios, you're a sap mr. jap bore none of the bland plot elements that would reduce the latter day popeye cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie.we all remember how we'd have popeye and olive oyl together. enter bluto, usually the exponent of wolf whistle and an on acceptable on-screen version of a male reaction to feminine pulchritude. olive falls for bluto's less than honorable attentions; until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out, "hey babe, how 'bout a kiss?" at this point we hear "help! help, popeye and the diminutive sailor shows up to save the day; replete with the obligatory can of spinach! do we exaggerate, schultz? once again this jap sap cartoon is nothing like any of that. oh sure, it follows the storyline of now having popeye in the u.s. navy. the brothers fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first peacetime draft in united states history. max and dave even put popeye in service aboard the mythical battleship, the u.s.s. pensyltucky.our point is just this. you're a sap mr. jap and others like spinach fer britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the theatre's program at all in the true sense. rather they are a sort of grouping of editorial cartoons much like those from any "great metropolitan newspaper". these animated shorts, much like those still one panel illustrations, have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideals, such as a just and lasting peace. in most cases, the hero (popeye, bugs bunny or whoever) is alone with the symbol of the enemy. both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even if they are cloaked in humorous trappings for wider palatability.our liberal stupidgencia (the antithesis of intelligencia) may not see themselves this way; but for this sort of behavior, they are no more than neo nazi book burners.please, allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both historical and humorous.poodle schnitz!!

if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in!in this cartoon, popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat. the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed. but looks can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship! what follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.be forewarned, the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion. keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at the time. but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era.

this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it, and its decidedly above-average for its genre. it was nicely drawn, too, with some great angles, good detail and....well, lots of interesting sights.what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat, with two guys on it. (incidentally, why were the "japs" always pictured with big, round glasses and bucked teeth?). anyway, these harmless-looking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty. oh, boy, thinks the gullible popeye, "wait until the admiral sees this!" in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above, we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer.....and popeye is in deep....um, water! "why, you double-crossing ja-pansies!," yells our sailor man.how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch.

this short was the first short released by paramount famous studios and was one of several done by the studio showing popeye engaged directly against the enemy, most often the japanese. while warner brothers, disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, did shorts often depicting germans as foils, the majority of famous studios efforts focused on the japanese. given pearl harbor and popeye's naval ties, this is quite understandable. this is an average short. seein' red, white an' blue and spinach for britain have aged better. but it's still worth watching. recommended.

i loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of american working class society and seaport life in the first half of the 20th century. i was drawn in by the timeless watchability of this realistic performance. see and feel the star power. melancholic "greek" comedy. anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer back?...or a little ginger? hey, waterboy !!

viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent. however, the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance. greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound. greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films. this story was very sad because greta garbo(anna christie),"ninotchka",'39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain. there were many scenes of old nyc, the brooklyn bridge, coney island and the sky line of manhattan. charles bickford(matt burke),"days of wine & roses",'62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.

039: anna christie (1930) - released 2/21/1930; viewed 3/10/06 on october 24, 1929: black thursday, the stock market crashes. now the country and indeed the world will look to hollywood for escape from the worldwide great depression.births: anne frank, june carter, yasser arafat, bob newhart, barbara walters, doris roberts, ed asner, dick clark, roy e. disney, gene hackman.doug: at long last, our odyssey resumes in earnest with greta garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called anna christie. an excellent performance from ms. garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them. how odd). one thing i noticed over and over was the way the swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter j with a y sound. anna ends up being the only character i liked; i didn't really care for her estranged father or her would-be suitor. it looks like the sound-recording systems are getting better (nobody leaning in to talk into the mystery-can), but the camera still isn't moving. we'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.kevin: our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet greta garbo, anna christie. this is a very simple movie, with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time, often with a static camera. it was great to see marie dressler in sound as well, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs. i very much enjoyed garbo's performance, as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. i didn't really like george marion or charles bickford, maybe because i wasn't sympathetic to either of them, so i was relieved and excited when anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't "belong" to either her estranged father or her muscle-bound irish boyfriend. it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.last film viewed: speedy (1928). last film chronologically: the love parade (1929). next film: the blue angel (1930).

the magnificent greta garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. she gets fine support from the rest of the cast which includes charles bickford the rugged sailor who captures her heart. ms. garbo gives a great performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years. also in the cast is that great actress marie dressler. a great movie!

'anne christie' was garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard. she plays the lead character, anna, who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris (a drunken barge owner played by george f marion), and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water.meeting irish matt (charles bickford) may mark the turning point for her ... or does it? garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which, although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace, still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later. marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill, dinner at eight, and emma; while marion and bickford are more than adequate.an interesting slice of movie history. garbo would do better talkies in the years following, but 'anna christie' will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen.

viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles. i give the nod to garbo(but not by much)in regard to her naturalness. robeson is majestic. but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater. something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities. there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground. these were very progressive films for their time. it's quite probable that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america.

greta garbo stars in 'anna christie', a very early 1930 mgm 'talkie', the first time 'garbo talks'. 'anna christie' is a powerful movie but not for everyone. the movie is filmed like a stage play, short on sets and cinematography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. eugene o'neil who wrote the play 'anna christie' is known for his dark work and garbo's character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past.the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre. not helping matters is that george f. marion who plays anna's estranged dad, chris christofferson, is verbally hard to understand. marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who’s teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea'. but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent, this is true to o'neils original play. marie dressler's dialogue as marthy owens is equally hard to understand. dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women, a 'wharf rat'. her dialogue also is true to o'neils original play as is charles bickford as the irish seamen, matt burke who pursues anna in a troubled relationship. garbo is actually the easiest to understand.the films strong point is greta garbo. she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood. here her look isn't glamorous, it's tortured. her body posture nearly doubles over in agony. she scrunches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. garbo conveys these angst-ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery.this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life. it’s not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. ‘anna christie’ is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination, this is one helluva ride.

anna christie (1930)anna christie has some terrific parts, and some amazing performances, and yet it should be even better than it is. it has drama. some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the interior shots around the table are a bore, other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting. then there are the nearly historical, lively scenes set in coney island (even a brief jittery roller coaster ride), and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds, and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over, and the women (scantily dressed) egg the men on is weirdly sexual come-on kind of way. all the while garbo (at the front of the crowd) watches.garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie. she plays all sides of her character. she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish. she laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes outward. in some ways it's a forward looking, remarkable movie (directed by clarence brown, who has a whole series of significant films from this pre-code sound era).though based on a successful eugene o'neil play, it's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times. marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked. and then there is greta garbo, who really does have a natural presence, even if it seems she's overacting, just slightly, at times (but then, so is everyone else). garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress, and this is her talking film debut. audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year.

this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear. the performance of marie dressler (i hope i am spelling it right) as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film. it is an amazing performance. she is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice. you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. amazing. and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great. the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories, very deep and intense. this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it. some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile.

and with those words one of the great movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion. 'garbo talks' and she spoke those words in her first sound film, an adaption of the eugene o'neil play anna christie. unlike with some other players and some other studios, mgm took great care in finding the proper vehicle for greta garbo. many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of talkies. their heavy native accents would get in the way, some didn't know any english. it was no accident that anna christie was chosen for garbo. first of all it being authored by one of america's leading playwrights, it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. secondly since the title role was someone who was swedish, the accent could be explained. finally a lot of the kinks from early talkies had been worked out, even though anna christie still made use of title cards.like most of o'neil's work it's short on action, but long and deep on characterization. the story takes place on the new york waterfront where garbo as anna has come to live with her father george marion. marion ran away to sea years ago when anna was a baby and marion abandoned his wife. anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution.marion of course is glad to see her, he even kicks out marie dressler, the old waterfront crone he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. of course both marion and garbo have their problems adjusting to each other, not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by charles bickford who takes a fancy to garbo.marion is repeating his role from the original broadway production. the role of anna on stage was done by pauline lord. anna christie ran for 177 performances in the 1921-22 season on broadway. it's one of o'neil's best known works and one that's revived frequently. of course garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured. greta garbo received an oscar nomination for best actress and the film also got nominations for clarence brown as best director and william daniels for cinematography. daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. and brown created the mood around the waterfront where the film is set.eugene o'neil's work is timeless so anna christie even with a lot of the trappings of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do. garbo also shows she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. anna christie is a classic, all the way around.

i'd read all the negative reviews for "anna christie". you know, the gripes about the static camera, out-dated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. yep, clarence brown's camera remains stationary for the most part, and i'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. yep, there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. it's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. but... then there's garbo, marie dressler, george f. marion and charles bickford, all proving that great acting is timeless.i believe "anna christie" is still one of garbo's most iconic performances. and it's a wonderful performance from the divine one, in a role that is really quite atypical for her. yes, we've seen garbo weary and almost beaten, yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. garbo played so many (delightful) costume roles, that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. she's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make-up. this performance seems quite raw from garbo.the plot, from the o'neill play, follows weary swedish ex-prostitute anna, and her reunion with her boozy, seaman father. anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty, as she tells drunken, slovenly marthy (dressler)in a bar. she finds solace in a life at sea, and romance with a rough-hewn, but good-hearted, fisherman (charles bickford). but her past threatens to ruin it all.charles bickford is overlooked in garbo's long line of (largely inferior) leading men. he's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence. the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks, but she's terrific and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the dreadful "dinner at eight". i've never really heard of george f. marion before, but he was wonderful as garbo's father.this is pre-code, and rather gritty and dark by mgm's standards. i really enjoyed it, and while it may creak in some places, it's still wonderful.

for greta garbo's first talking picture, mgm wisely chose eugene o'neill's pultizer prize winning 1921 play anna christie. also wisely, the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast (george marion as anna's father, chris, and james t. mack as johnny the priest - transmuted to "johnny the harp" for films so as not to offend). this little change is interesting. like too many films accused (by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins) of being "little more than filmed stage plays," the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property. by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone, or opening it up because they could, too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. fortunately, the respect the studio had for both o'neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. wonder of wonders, marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo's anna reveals her past on "the farm" to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! what the league of decency must have thought of that! the source play's greatest problem has always been that chris's friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage - the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize. the perfectly cast marie dressler (who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood) is the perfect balance for garbo's anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes, doesn't allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o'neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne's second act appearance in show boat. anna and marthy's early scene together on screen (16 minutes into the film) taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. not to be missed. anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. it's hard to imagine that a latter day remake, which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with george marion's original broadway chris) could improve on this excellent filming. the internal scenes hew closest to the play, but the exteriors shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the new york harbor).nearly all garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from camille, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies), but this anna christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films, mata hari and grand hotel, and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, ninotchka ("garbo laughs!"), surely stand as her best.o'neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded "sea plays," should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u.s. entered the conflict, the long voyage home (1940). it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie, and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non-westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.

i absolutely love this movie! evil dead has nothing on this film! night of the demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. it's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? stooge has some of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (he's my favorite character) a lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his left over halloween apples in a pie, and his throat is mangled from the inside out. the sound track is awesome. the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. the make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; angela gave me nightmares as a kid. if you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. but, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole halloween, haunted house with the demons cliché, than this one is definitely a must own.

if you think about it, it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty (one of the world's most controversial topics) that offends neither those for nor against. it's a testament to tim robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well (shawshank redemption, jacob's ladder).this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the "for" and "against" camps... so subtle that it can't be put into words, subtle to the point of vanishing, yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible, that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough...

this was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever! it refused to seem one-sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get. this movie had one of the most 'human' (and i use this term in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! this movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). sister helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious(which is also rare). and it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out. and we have the director to thank for that. this is not a film for entertainment. but it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart. i can't think of another film like it.

let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life. i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's, which the decline of western civilization documents, with the exception of x and black flag, being more of new york and english punk guy. after i saw this movie that completely changed. the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic, strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street-cree through their lifestyles, but it is a great display of hedonism at it's best, coupled with some fun, loud rock n roll. one of the best scenes, and actually most insightful, is the interview with claude bessy of catholic discipline, or 'kick-boy' as he was known to slash magazine readers. originally from france, he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk, or diy, attitude to music, politics, and life in general. darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time, but the germs' performance of manimal is pretty decent, complete with a young pat smear. black flag's performance with chavo pederast on vocals (it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band) is decent, and x and fear give the best performances in the movie. look out for the interviews with the young punk kids. you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary. highly recommended.

if i assume that you know what this film is about, i am also forced to assume that you've come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what i say. if all this rings true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review. if you're undecided, or not really entirely certain what happened in the late '70s and early '80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture, you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective instead.although i didn't grow up in california, the american punk scene was the first music scene i ever truly lived in. at the height of the hardcore i was immersed in from about 1979-1981 everybody had a band and the only common denominators between bands and indeed members of their audiences were:* the rejection of conformity* tolerance and enjoyment of difference* a desire to have fun - hard and fasthairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures, and violent slam-dancing were not integral to what i experienced, though there were certainly cliques or factions who tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. and there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascistic paradigm of anarchic, self mutilating, angry young cop-haters. although the interviews with audience punks in penelope spheeris' excellent cal-punk documentary "decline of western civilization" present a very narrow view of the subculture some of us enjoyed, the interviews with the bands, club owners, promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of 'the scene'. nevertheless, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged. unfortunate as this is, the blame for it rests solely with those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not the film-makers. don't blame the messenger. the music presented here is not going to be for everybody - nor even most. it's not the most crude stuff out there, but it's loud, obnoxious, fast, and less concerned with technique than with raw energy. for me, seeing early black flag with ron reyes singing, x, fear and the circle jerks was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film. as much as i like the germs, seeing darby crash for the mess - and the nice guy - that he was left me a bit cold. nevertheless, the scenes of darby playing with his pet tarantula while "shut down" droned on and on in the background were precious. the x interview is also great. spheeris' straightforward documentary style is supplemented by wild pans and zooms during the musical segments. during the interviews, framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said. considering her experience and the budget, spheeris did as well as anybody could have with this film.recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, honest, direction-less rebellion before amaerican punk was co-opted into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.

spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l.a. punk explosion of the early eighties. it's all there: not just great, great bands like black flag, fear, x, the germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh, shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. where is that today? the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. if you need a proof for that, watch fear's performance in decline. unmatched. great film! how come this is not available on vid, ld or dvd? p.s. the follow-up decline pt. ii is hilarious, too

the rise of punk music was scarcely documented on film and most people tend to focus on the happenings of other cities such as london or new york. penelope spheeris managed to preserve a snapshot of los angeles circa '79-'81 which proves a vibrant and diverse art/music community had spawned which rivalled any other. to some, the bands read like a who's who of now legendary american punk; black flag, x, circle jerks, germs, fear. purists argue that vital bands were missed (weirdos, zeros, flesheaters) and that the movie was the cause of an onslaught of suburban poseurs and macho violence. however, the issues touched upon in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in the cliques/fashions of today.

kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays, this used to be required watching when i was in high school. it really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in la in 1980. as the bands play, spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles, which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone. but also it turns the camera's pov into that of tourist, passing through this alien world. the band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore. then again, it's not as easy to come by $16/month former-church closets like chavez of black flag does. how many unheard of bands do you know that aren't trying like the dickens to get a record deal? these guys just didn't care. and who can't love the commentary of the little french dude who used to be the "singer" for catholic discipline (of which phranc was a member). his gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film: "i have excellent news for the world ... there's no such thing as new wave." whew! what a relief!

one of the major successes to the decline of western civilization, filmmaker penelope spheeris' indie breakthrough, is that it can perhaps appeal to non-punk fans as to the hardcore ones. more importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely "market-worthy", when bands would play (or, at the least, try to play in some cases) in dank, dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self-respect as they had respect for the bands. for the fan, such as myself, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends of la's punk-scum, some dead, some still living and still hard-working in the scene. performances and interviews include the likes of the circle jerks, x, black flag (in the pre-henry rollins days), catholic discipline, fear, the alice bag band, and most memorable (in my opinion) being the germs. while i knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film (the jerks and black flag mostly), i had only heard rumors about lead singer (the late) darby crash, and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the, if not the, epitomes of the punk movement. he doesn't take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks it's complete gibberish, and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free-form way exhilarating. a performer like that would probably scare steve miller and jackson browne out of their skins.decline of western civilization may not turn on every non-punk fan that seeks this film out (it's hard to find on video), but it shouldn't necessarily turn them off either. like a kind of anthropologist that's sneaked into the party, spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat, their motives, their likes and hatreds, and the power that was their on and off-screen personas. a few of them almost come off as normal, some don't, but they're only offensive to those who aren't too open to things. on top of that, the film is a must-see to the kinds of kids that think they're punk fans just because they listen to good charlotte and blink-182: if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love, give the pioneers a chance. a

if you liked this movie, be sure to check out others directed by hrebejk - you are in for a treat. this is unfortunately not his best, but still million times better than an average movie from the mainstream cinema. it explores relationships, especially the abusive ones, has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting. some plot inconsistencies, clichés and hollow moments spoil the overall effect. to the previous reviewer and his comments on the czech psyche: an interesting approach, but i do not see this movie becoming a czech blockbuster. those folks are rather spoiled by their movie makers {check out also stuff by sverak, gedeon} and this one lags a bit behind.

wow. at first i thought who writes these things! how hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. however our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think. indeed the wealthy gentleman was all a woman could aspire to and yet... the pull of her husband, her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. what to do, what to do?? as a viewer you became as confused and misdirected as she was. anyway what i really came on this site to gush about was my admiration of the voice of the engish, i thought, although it is actually the voice of an irish singer in the film. looking him up i find he is glen hansard, whom i had never heard of before that day. what a find. i am so grateful. wow, what a voice! what a day! thank you biff!

first i have to admit that i have had some doubts about the director. he has done some movies (with jarkovsky) about the recent "czech=east" history or more precisely about families (individuals) how did they survive some historical moments. but it was always like the chines food sour-sweet. this movie was totally different. it was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human natures. this film is an excellent piece of art (story, acting, picture, music) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don't want to see. by the way i have saw it on a dvd (with english subtitles) but i am afraid that in the usa i wont be able to get it.

this film by the well-known czech director and writer collaborator petr jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details. taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old lucina (michaela mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic kuba (adam misik).the poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.marcela (anna geislerová), the beauty, and jarda (roman luknár) have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. there's no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. his car-thief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes (josef abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail."beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/on whom she can rely," begins the graves poem. but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela, when he meets her at the police station. he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany, where he, though prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. he's here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent jarda from going off to jail.in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, zdena (jana brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka (jiri schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own, and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies. improbable--perhaps implausible. why should benes like him? but then, what is benes's whole story? about some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. clearly the "good angel," benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing. it's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. also to be dealt with is jarda's religious fanatic mother sdena (jana brejchova), and her interactions with zdena and richard are something to watch. but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by jarda and the car thief pal. if you revere hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. also included are a number of songs by glen hansard/marketa irglova of the oscar-award-winning irish musical film 'once,' including the latter's theme song, "falling." they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'once'--though this film came first.hrebejk's people are arresting; even little koba has his shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. but such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. the acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. it's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to graves's poem that marcela still has hot sex with jarda during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with benes and her kids. but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of jarda's annoyingly pious mother (emília vásáryová). how come all of a sudden we learn koba is getting letters from "india" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? when did that come about? interesting details, hastily pasted in. this seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.

beauty in trouble (kráska v nesnázích) is not a great title. all the descriptions of this film fail to capture what it really is  an adult fairy tale. a poor girl is wooed by a prince. the "girl", marcela, played by the stunning anna geislerová, has an isabelle huppert beauty, with a red hair, face and figure that are beguiling, sexual, and endlessly fascinating. she has a louse of a husband, but they have great sex. the kids listen to the lovemaking through walls. it's rough and passionate, as the sex of the working class seems to often be portrayed in film. but it's also for us to recognize that this is the thing that binds them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage. the husband, a professional car thief, is eventually caught and thrown in jail. how she got into this marriage we don't know, but she is not exactly a high-class herself. but she's beautiful, intelligent (we assume) and loves her gorgeous and resilient kids. she deserves more. and she may get the life she deserves - eventually. (no spoiler!) she is forced to move back with mom after her husband is sent to jail. mom has a hideous second husband (read ugly stepfather). he is a real horror show. he borders on being a child abuser to the kids. he's obsessive about cleanliness, but ungraciously farts at the table, all the while demanding manners and decorum from the kids. he's real low class socially handicapped wretch. mom puts up with him, like marcella's husband, at least he's lusty - hideous but horny. the ambivalent, confusing, layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting. these characters have flaws, some seemed driven by class, some by innate character. these flaws and details of character are charming one minute and contemptible the next. the audience really has to negotiate conflicting feeling of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment, and the role of a woman as mother and wife through the quickly changing terrain of the story. at the bottom line, as with many films like the wonderful icelandic movie "thicker than water (blóðbönd), the children can be the victims. what's right in the end may be what's best for the children  who are our salvation and our future. it's a theme played out these days in films ranging from pan's labyrinth to children of men. foreign. cinema is recognizing in intricate morality tales that life is confusing, brutal, unfair and, as adults, we must get our act together in order to pass something worthwhile to the next generation. if we give in to our baser instincts, we may lose ourselves and the world in the process. the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in kráska v nesnázích speak to the qualities of what makes a man, what drives a women, what embodies hope, what is class - is it economic status of the fabric of one's character? the film is richly human as embodied by the very last 2 shots, which moved me incredibly and unexpectedly. the director's choices are so subtle and intelligent that to compare this to an american film seems unfair. americans sometimes seem to lack the desire to consider that paradoxes in human nature don't offer set resolutions. but here, perilously couched in ostensible fairy tale for adults, are interesting moral questions. don't be fooled by the simple story; this is a great movie.

this was an excellent movie! i saw this at the karlovy vary iff in the czech republic, and it won an award there. this is the first film i've ever seen from jan (the director), and i was impressed. it's a great story about love and family. the movie has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama, and suspense all in one. i will not give away any of the plot, but this is a well-made film, and i would watch it again if i had the chance! the cinematography/editing is great, the film simply flows, and the characters are warm, and they are the kind that one can relate to. i hope you can enjoy this film as i did. if anyone knows where i can find this in the united states, or if they plan on releasing it on dvd anytime soon, please let me know!!

i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival. the film's title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the robert graves poem beauty in trouble. jan hrebejk directs a screenplay by petr jrchovský from a story by hrebejk and jrchovský. the story begins in 2002 when prague is hit by one of those devastating 100 year floods that destroys the household of marcela (ana ceislerová) and jarda (roman luknár) and their two children kuba (adam misik) and lucina (michaela mrvikova). because of the moldy conditions where they now live kuba's asthma is life threatening. marcela works and jarda runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to. jarda's shady occupation runs him afoul of the law and one of his theft victims becomes infatuated with marcela. evzen benes (josef abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between italy and the czech republic and offers to care marcela and her two kids. jana brejchová is marcella's mother who lives with her common-law husband called uncle richie played by jirí schmitzer in probably the film's best role. rounding out this excellent cast is emília vasaryova as jarda's mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious charlatan. there is a lot going on here for a small film and it's good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief. ales brezina provides the music score with additional music from czech singer raduza and irish singer glen hansard. there is a lot to like about this film and i would give it an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.

crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone at the bowlo has seen it and all say the same. the wheel of cheese was a great part of the movie, also the loud speaker "dear mr so and so you have left you right indicator on". or when jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer, "bowls is hard work" cracked me up. and when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling bingo number. jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray. bloody great movie if you are into lawn bowls as you can relate to it, if your not a lawn bowler forget it i think. the evans head bowlo would rate as the best club in aus, friendly people, great company.hi to evans head bowlo steve

crackerjack is another classic aussie film. as so many australian films like the castle, the dish and sunday too far away, it goes somewhere that hasn't been widely explored in film before, this time it is the game of lawn bowls and bowling clubs. crackerjack is a much slower paced sports movie than many you will find such as remember the titans or million dollar babybut the characters involved are athletes in their own right. this movie is a show case of a large area of australian culture and features a sport that is popular and on the rise of popularity in australia. mick molloy presents a classic, unforgettable character. it really is a must see.

coming from oz i probably shouldn't say it but i find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline. this comedy lacks in nothing. great story, no overacting, no melodrama, just brilliant comedy as we know oz can do it. do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop.

considering the appalling track record of mick molloy since going out on his own, i had rather low expectations of crackerjack. even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous. in fact, if it wasn't for the fact that i'd received free tickets to the preview, i would have resisted the pressure from the missus (who thinks mick's a hunk - there's a worry) to pay money for it.the first few minutes of the movie had me worried - it starts with one of micks tired "get angry at insignificant things" routines, but that was given a neat touch, which at least made it a little refreshing. the rest of the script was pretty good, and very light hearted - even the typical mick molloy (and judith lucy) humour was delivered well and whilst i never had to pick myself up from the aisles, it generated a lot more chuckles that i was expecting (and it was consistant).there's nothing new in the plot - pretty predictable, but it moved along quickly between one-liners and other jokes - i never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short; mick must have worked hard on polishing his script. there were a one or two "late show" in-jokes, and one or two jokes that only melbournians would get - but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience.something that i found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of john clarke - he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy, but that doesn't detract from the movie too much.over all, i enjoyed this australain comedy, and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie. i left the cinema with a decent sized grin - a pretty hard thing for an australian comedy to do in my books. 7.5/10

while not for everyone, crackerjack is a delight to watch, with tongue planted firmly in cheek. the likeable character of jack simpson, played by mick molloy, is scamming the local "bowlo" for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side, selling the parking space to work colleagues. when the bowling club members need to raise some money to save their club, they call upon jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls.filled with aussie charm, the laconic wit of mick molloy is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his earlier work in radio. perfect aussie casting with bill hunter as jack's bowling mentor stan coombes, john clarke (of the games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner bernie fowler, with samuel johnson as jack's flatmate dave, and judith lucy as the jaded journalist, nancy.initially, i figured only fans of molloy would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue rinse set exiting the cinema chuckling, this is a film for everyone.

a very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene workings of an australian bowling club. the way they deal with various problems such as takeovers, memberships and general running of the club, not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted.

a fairly typical australian movie where the underdog saves the day inspite of himself. i guess there is no real reason to see this pic if you have seen "the castle" or "the dish". it still leaves you with a positive feeling at the end and it as good or better than most hollywood stuff.

i was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. why? firstly because mick malloy's humour can (in my humble opinion) be pretty crass and over the top, evidenced by his ill fated shemozzle of a television show some years back. and secondly because good aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the tassie tiger. sensibly mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest australian films in years. the cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances. interesting to see john clarke playing the villain in this piece. it's a one dimensional part but jc still adds a touch of class, as always. good to see judith lucy also getting a guernsey or should i saw bowls uniform on the big screen. she's a real talent, pity a number of her retorts were expletives. her own material is a lot wittier. interesting character though. bowls reporter on a local rag. how low on the journalist food chain can one get!!crackerjack may not be the funniest film i've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion, well worth a look. lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest grossing australian film this year. good to see someone finally make a quirky, gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many australian 'comedies' before it. finally a bit of trivia. if you're wondering which aussie rules team mick supports check out the flag on his workstation. also look out for his old partner in crime, tony martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene.  

crackerjack, starring mick malloy & judith lucy - both part of the cast in the early 90's saturday night comedy show "the late show", bill hunter, an australian movie icon and john clarke, who we still see regularly on australian tv along side brian dawe.crackerjack, losely is about a guy in his early 30's (jack simpson, played by mick malloy) who pays his yearly memebership at the local bowls club in order to get a few car park spaces for which he uses himself and rents out to others as cheap inner city parking.the club falls on hard times, and pulls all the resources and memebers together it can, jack gets a phone call telling him to turn up to next saturday's bowls match or lose his membership (and conseqently his car park space)i wont spoil the rest, but the film is funny, light hearted and contains everything a good aussie film should.if your not australian, then some of the jokes and humour will no doubt baffle you, if you are an aussie - do yourself a favor and sit yourself down to crackerjack.. its now available on dvd, i already have my copy!10/10.. awesome flick!

this is the first feature film from australian comedian mick molloy. mick wrote the film with his brother richard with help from john clarke, another comedian and actor. mick & john also have starring roles along with several other iconic australian actors - bill hunter, frank wilson et al. the basic premise of the movie is that slimy jack simpson (mick molloy) has become a member of a lawn bowls club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work. the club is in dire financial straits and calls on jack to help. john clarke plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a "poker machine slum" jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and jacks eventual redemption. this is quite a clever little movie. it is well above mick molloys usual gutter humor. it is pretty well written and well acted. the older aussie actors are brilliant (bill hunter, frank wilson monica maughan and ors) the film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace, but that adds to the charm of the movie. there is low level coarse language.

crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides.the combination of the central character being played by mick malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens - and all laughed at the comedy.as would be expected of a movie with mick malloy and judith lucy there was quite a bit of swearing, but it was not overdone and the audience i sat with certainly enjoyed it!mick malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club (three times) simply to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium) but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membership.judith lucy does a fine job as his local journalist/love-interest and there are fabulous performances from bill hunter, frank wilson, monica maughan, lois ramsey and many others.john clarke's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance.the not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy.i'm sure that those who enjoyed the castle and the dish would also enjoy this movie.

worth it for: if not for mick molloy's work, then for judith lucy. she brings her usual classy style of unbridled foul-mouthery to the role, and steals the show in parts.imho: i'm not much of an autograph hunter, but i have collected 3. the first is samuel l. jackson's, the other 2 are in this movie: tony martin and mick molloy. altho martin only makes a cameo appearance, molloy not only stars but co-wrote and co-produced this flick. i've been a fan of their for years now (apparently i was the only one laughing during the on-set urination in the first episode of the short lived the mick molloy show), so i went in to this with high expectations. i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed. with mick doing a lot of the work on this thing there's plenty of his usual trademarks. phrases like "blow it out your arse" and "these bowls are s***house" are all over the place, aswell as plenty of winnie blues being sucked down. it's also the sort of stupid, original story you'd expect from someone like him. this is like one of those cliqued, american, sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. but rather than trying to make a dull american sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army: lawn bowls. but the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very, very funny. what's even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game, it's never insulting to the elderly, and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything. it's just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. mick is great in the first real acting role i've ever seen him in, as is judith lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them have had a lot of practice... this is the best australian comedy i've seen in a long time. go see it and learn the joys of lawn bowls!it's a bit like: major league?score: 8 / 10

i was very impressed with the latest production from mick molloy. as a fan of his, i was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here. he wisely opted with a more subtle, broad style of comedy in crackerjack, rather than his usual low brow, in-your-face ramblings. it is, at times, inconsistent and un-even, but a decent script works past that, and makes for some entertaining viewing. directed by paul moloney (who has directed almost every australian tv series imaginable), crackerjack tells the story of jack simpson, a bloke that belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking. when the club hits financial trouble, he is forced to bowl competitively in an attempt to raise the funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine haven. a familiar, and successful formula, that is handled well. there is no denying that the film owes it's success to the great casting of molloy. he seemed to have a great rapport with samuel johnson, and excellent chemistry with judith lucy, and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality, you can't help but wonder why he hadn't tried his arm at film earlier. to smooth out the in-experienced cast, the delightful frank wilson and bill hunter support, and often steal their scenes. they are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease. had it not been for the huge success of 'my big fat greek wedding', crackerjack would have made it to number 1 at the australian box office, but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved, even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort. all in all, a witty, feel-good movie. great cast, great crew, and a great soundtrack, combine to make one of the better australian films of 2002. 7/10.

sharky's machine is easily one of burt reynolds best efforts. it also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. erotic and violent, the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in atlanta, and delivering a chaotic detective case, to you(the viewer), on a silver platter. dedicated and determined, sharky must stop the murder of dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who's clientel is anything but ordinary. before long, sharky's crimefighting machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of atlanta. as a resident of metro atlanta, i recall the excitement in town during the movie's production. sharky's machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of atlanta. twenty years removed and 2,000,000-more people later, the film stands the test of time. trust me, atlanta has not changed. one of the highlights of the picture is dar robinson's daring stunt(a classic, symbolic ending). it was even featured on that's incredible, abc's reality show of the period. it's just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one. kick back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver cinema action.

sharky's machine is a crime drama set in early 80's atlanta. it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city. the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to it's knees. sharky's link to bringing down this syndicate is a high-priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie. the action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score are pretty good. the acting is b-level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collection.overall 7/10peace buggieblade

i just want to say that this movie was excellent .i loved it from the beginning until the end. the acting was great .the director did an amazing job and i would like to see it again.jennifer tilly did a very good performance , the guy that interpreted his father (manny) was another great actor but i can not recall his name .i can't wait for el padrino ii.damian chapa looks so good and i think he is one of the most talented actors out there. there is pleanty of latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film!rent it!!! rent it !!! rent it !!!

i am finally seeing the el padrino movie, from what i can see it is an incredible film, and lots of action damian chapa is good director, but i must admit i love his acting the best.also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit.however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic. why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is? i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also.i am one of those people who love to see artists make it.b.s.

this film was one that i have waited to see for some time. i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character kilo , a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal. after spending some time in prison kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems. kilo finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear how important a man's word is and stands for. a war begins as the street is in arms against lords of wealth and corrupt power.a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns. this film will leave you riveted. i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored. excellent. go rent it today!!

this movie was simply amazing.the writing was incredible as well as the directing and acting.the story instantly gets you interested.this movie is one of those movies that has your heart pounding the whole time.as always damian chapa is brilliant,his on screen acting is as powerful as any hollywood actor.the cast in this film is perfect.each character made the story more complete.the cinematography was captivating and it uplifted the movie.i was totally stuck to the screen and couldn't stop watching it,there was no getting up for popcorn or anything.this movie is one of the best all year,maybe even the best.definitely rent this movie,i recommend it this movie if u want to see great filmaking or just for pure entertainment.

toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counter-terrorist forces accurately. just check out the end credits--there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed. the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us army's delta force (who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time) once the president waived the posse commitatus act of us code. the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time. and even the use of an ah-64 apache for air support--which might seem a bit over the top, is not terribly unrealistic. far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter-terrorist forces with far less accuracy.

i recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase i'm going through. i was born in 1980, and so film from mid-80s to mid-90s has quite an important place in my growing up.this particular movie was one of my favourites, and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk. it hasn't become worse with time, it is still a great fun film, with plenty of excitement in its own way. sure, it pales in the shadow of bigger, larger budget films, but don't let that stop you enjoying this.worth a rent, or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find it for.

this film is a perfect example of great escapism! i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning. sure it's just an action flick, but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about? the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters. the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing, it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys!! sean astin makes a great rebel, successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager.if you want fun, watch this film! i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality (go dvd's!)

oh boy !!! my god !!!! what a movie this one !!! this is probably the best movie by sean austin and louis gosset jr !!! i have seen all the comment for this movie...and most of them loves this movie very much!! but i don't really understand why it only got 6.1 in imdb list??? this one should above 7.5 !!! the plot and the script are completely perfect !! the acting are superbly well acted!!! sean austin...will wheaton...louis gosset jr....have given an incredible and awesome performance in their career!!! this movie contain a lot of action!!!just one thing i gotta say....watch it !!!!!!!!!10 out of 10 stars !!

this movie is my all time favorite movie! it has great acting, cute guys, and a great plot. sean astin is great in this movie! it has funny moments, sad moments, and happy moments. who could ask for anything more? this movie is great!

not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched. the viewer is irrestiblely drawn into the movie involving 5 young men working together to try and overcome insumaintable odds, sean astin as billy tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles from t.e.russell, wil wheaton and shawn phelan, the guidance and leadership of gosset's and astins characters makes the movie so much better. as time goes on the movie keeps gathering momentum and its a dissapointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie.

this is one of the best movies i've seen. the acting is good, the plot is solid, and the whole movie is very believable, which adds a lot to the movie. i rate this at least a 9.

yes, it's not a great cinematic achievement, but toy soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. the young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and i particularly liked shawn phelan as derek/"yogurt". i've seen this one plenty of times over the years, and will probably see it several more. just don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy!

this is one worth watching, although it is sometimes cheesy, it is great to see a young sean astin, and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie. i watched it many times when i was young, and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine (i happen to own a copy). so sit back with this movie, let reality go for a little while, and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half.

it's really not worthy of a 'best picture' consideration, but as entertainment goes, it does the job! this is one that i've watched, with pulse quickening every time, at least a dozen times.most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other work. those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it.this was a fun adventure. sort of like the little rascals if they just had to be serious.

i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in 1991. i was 12 then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush. i am now 23 and i still love this movie. the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho-guy movie! it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen. i only wish that it was available on dvd!

quick summary of the book: boy, billy tepper, about 12 years old is school's main trouble maker, and if he gets kicked out of one more school he'll be sent off to boarding school. his upscale boy's school in switzerland (or somewhere like it) gets taken over by arab terrorists, why i'm not really sure. billy has no friends, and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database. he, with the help of two teachers thwarts the terrorists' plans, and save the entire school. the book wasn't bad, but was sooooooo cliché.now about the movie; they switched arab terrorists to cuban terrorists, and make billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends. they like to get into trouble, but normal teenage stuff. this movie was believable. maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. you can watch billy, joey, and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did (or at least wanting to).great action scenes. not everything goes as planned for either side. overthrowing the terrorists was messy, and good guys did get hurt. i won't say who, but it is heart wrenching (i know, i use that word a lot). sean astin is excellent. as a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend. this movie proved once again that he could play the leading man, kid, whatever. the only performance that may have upstaged his was wil wheaton's, who played the only son of a new jersey mafia man. he hated his father, and everything he stood for. (a far cry from wesley crusher) usually this genre of film is one i watch for the soul purpose of making fun; but not toy soldiers. the story line flows, the dialogue is usually believable. i can't think of a single moment where i found myself shouting at the tv "oh that would so not happen" great movie that should be in everyone's collection.

i'm seldom partial to movies about smart-assed teenagers who have problems with authority, but "toy soldiers" has grown on me with repeated viewings. this is as much a movie about billy tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else, and i give credit to sean astin and writer/director daniel petrie jr. that they don't make a big deal of that, but let it just unfold and sneak up on you. the camaraderie of tepper's friends, their grief over joey's death, and their joy at their survival, all are genuinely moving. and, i have to admit, i take a certain patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptilian) glee when the u.s. army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narco-terrorist butt. ooh-rah, general kramer! and the heroic robert folk score is the cherry on top. i'm sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like "toy soldiers," but as long as we don't take it too seriously, i don't see the need. this is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.

this came as a huge surprise for me. i had never heard of this movie when i first saw it, and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terrorist/hostage situation at a high school. toy soldiers has the best from it's time period of the early 90's, where action movies were light-hearted and very enjoyable. the action is good, the plot is interesting and way over the top, the bad guy is a one-dimensional hateful douchebag (which is great), louis gossett jr. is in it, it's simply a feel-good movie which i thoroughly enjoyed.you can't go wrong with this one if you like action. i give it a solid rating of 8/10.

i haven't seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least 10 times. now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terrorist(the "wishmaster")father to be released from prison. now i could just check the plot here on imdb but i'm pretty sure thats right. any way, a group of boys at the school decide that they're not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back. this film has always been stuck in my mind. there are so many images that i haven't forgotten like joey's(i think?)death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kids(no idea of his name)fake asthma attack. just a great film. it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic. guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns, a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenade(not sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the end)and the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail. great action, great humor, good acting, wonderful film experience. i've got to watch this again after all these years!

these kinda movies just don't get the credit they deserve. this is my 2nd all time favorite movie, (stand by me being 1st.) the reason i watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin. i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. everything in the movie is very exceptional. the script, the acting, the screenplay. i was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn't in the room i would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta (wil wheaton) died. i did not see that coming!! at all!! i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn't real popular back in the 90's. i was born a few years after it came out so, of course, i didn't go see it in the theaters, but im sure i would have if i would have been alive. if any of my friends watched this, they would be like, "uhh okay?" but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. if you haven't seen this movie, or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.

picture this. someone makes a film about the columbine or virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone (i know this isn't but bare with me) and stars sean astin off of goonies!! picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of ajar doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film. unfortunately it doesn't go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didn't go crazy enough. pity, its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness, well worth a cult status

didn't sound like it was from a fantasy film. the film is dark, with dark overtones. the soundtrack way too uplifting to the point it intruded on the visuals. i'm sure they were aiming for something militant, but it just didn't work. the scene when astin is attempting to escape is a perfect example. why does it sound like the goonies? there is no comedy, there is no brightness to this!! the idea of the movie is great, and the acting is very good as well. i enjoyed everyone's performances. it's available on netflix's online viewing. definitely worth a viewing, but write your own soundtrack!!

sean astin pulls off another amazing performance in "toy soldiers". he plays the highly intelligent prankster, billy tepper along with wil wheaton and keith coogan who play his best friends, joey trotta and jonathan "snuffy" bradberry. during a regular day at saint anselm's school for boys, a group of dangerous terrorists take all the boys and teachers as hostages and threatens to blow up the school if the leader, luis cali (andrew divoff's), father isn't released from the american prison, but these aren't just ordinary boys that are taken hostage, most of these kids are the sons of very powerful people in america and half of them were expelled from other schools before they came to saint anselm's. they're mouths and actions just may get them killed. when the government is desperately trying to figure out a way to help, billy, joey, snuffy and some more boys decide to take matters into their own hands.

this is really good. original ideas in the film and a great terrorist action film. only second to die hard and die hard with a vengeance, this film has suspense and a good plot. i would recommend it to anyone with a taste in films like mine; action, terrorism and gangster/mafia.

i first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and i loved it, i decided to get the dvd last year for my birthday.. it has the right amount of suspense, action and drama.. this movie is about prep school called the regis school and its packed with rebellious kids, in which one kid william tepper (sean astin) has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at the regis school committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader luis cali's (andrew divoff) father has been sent to prison,and the leader will do anything including killing the students, setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back.along side william tepper, is his rebellious friends at the regis school, one in particular is joey trotta (wil wheaton) in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to the regis school because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school, so william, joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics.this movie was really awesome and i believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say "die hard" and even though i would have to agree with them, they need to recognize that toy soldiers was a good thriller, it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and i would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... but overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it... i would buy it! i recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10

this is one of the best "bloke" movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated, its one of those movies that would never get made today, which makes it very special! in fact, a very similar movie was made in the 90's called "masterminds" and it was a pg variation on the same theme, but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter.so what's so special about this film? it's the comradre between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film. sean astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80/90's, particularly "the goonies". he also went onto greater things with "rudy" and "the lord of the rings" trilogy, but "encino man" is a good trip down memory lane. will wheaton from "stand by me" lends nice support to the film and andrew divoff is a terrific villain. louis gossett jr sleepwalks in his role, but he does add some brevity to the film, particularly his relationship with astin's rebellious nature.so how's the action? by today's standards, it's rather tedious and cheap looking, almost like a tv movie, but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students. however, the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor.so park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick, but don't expect oscar material!

colombian terrorists hold hostage a military school in the u.s. until their demands are met. the students decide to fight back. will they be able to do it?silly premise but the film actually works. the group of kids who fight were all up and coming when this film came out in 1991: sean astin (looking very cute); wil wheaton (looking miserable); keith coogan; george perez (the token latino who is very handsome, very muscular and is mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear); t.e. russell (the token black guy) and shawn phelan. none of them are very good actors (except astin), but who cares? this is a mindless action film. the only other good performances are from denholm elliott (having a ball as the headmaster) and louis gossett jr. as the dean.other than that--there's lots of action, suspense, explosions and little brains. in other words---fun! only complaint (and this is minor)--it's a bit too long (there are three endings) and there is lots of casual, bloody violence (the r rating was well-earned). still, i enjoyed it a lot.

i think that toy soldiers is an excellent movie. it's one of the only movies that, aside from some well known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually act. in my opinion, the plot is captivating. it keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life. i think that everyone would enjoy this movie. sean astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent. he's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both. i hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting. if you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a sean astin fan you will definitely like this movie.

this is one of those movies that are very underrated. again i am voting for an underrated movie. this movie has a good story line, maybe a bit farfetched but it could happen. sean astin(one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. the guy does a great job in acting but never gets recognized for his roles. he has done well since the goonies. not only him but louis gosset jr. does a swell job. i thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters but who cares about money anyways. all around this is a good movie that will have you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving itself. i enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well.

- the best bit : when the dull mobster (nicholas turturro) calls out to the runaway (matthew modine) "shane !.. come back shane !" and when the older wise guy asks him "what are you doing ?!" he replays simply "enjoying my time !" actually like me at the moment ! - the most creepy part : i've been wondering all the time of watching : where did i see that girl before ? where ? where ? till i found out while the closing credits.. ohh my god ! she's (elizabeth berkley) .. from the showgirls' fiasco ! but i just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on ! to tell you the truth i felt a brief tremor. she's really cute and nice but maybe hollywood had no mercy at all ! - the most sexy bit : when (berkley) says "do you mean the stuff which gives you a boner ?!". - the most dull thing : the retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !!??, moreover the mexican smuggler took 3 bullets (at the same car !) and he's not dead either !!?? - the most ugly thing : all of those murdered people, as well as the numerous (f) ward to a boring extent ! - the most beautiful thing : the crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations, the acting looked sweet also especially from (paul rodriguez) who stole the show for (as he had the best dialogue also !). - the most disappointing thing : although the direction didn't mess about the story's wittiness at all but in the same time it didn't give it a unique touch, a matchless signature, some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself. however maybe the low production wronged it well ! and of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too ! - the most confusing part : (matthew modine) is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of hollywood's "a" list of stars ?! what could possibly be the thing he made (or didn't make !) to end up in light independent jest like (the shipment) ?!! - the most absent scene : where did (jose) the mexican smuggler go at last ?! i thought that we'll see him again at the end, smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who, in a brief gimmick like this, could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world. - the most question i had after the end : when we'll see (the shipment - 2) ? as i'm so eager to see that fine small comic hurly-burly atmosphere again ! these were my own answers. if you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire, please e-mail me.

a stolen shipment of vigoroso, the mexican viagra; a beautiful girl who is trying to rebuild her life and to leave her husband, a boss of the italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart. this is the plot of "the shipment", a country comedy located in small town of paradise, arizona. despite its simply and classic story, the movie (directed by alex wright) has its fun moments: when elizabeth berkley (as candy porter), looking at a vigoroso green pill, says: "what"s this? a mint candy?". or when the girl enters the sheriff"s house and finds him completely naked. or when the vigoroso shipment ends up in that lake, at the final sequence... the cast offers some nice performances: by matthew modine as the sheriff of paradise valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and by elizabeth berkley, who"s character still loves her old boyfriend... the supporting cast, including nicholas turturro, paul rodriguez (as the mexican josè) and g michael gray (what kind of teeth...), makes a pleasant work, too. not an oscar material, but not so bad. a fun comedy without pretence.

surface is one of the best shows that i have ever seen. nbc is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete. nbc or someone else should give surface at least one more season just so it can be completed. it's as if nbc gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending. i just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to nim. i think i can say this safely about most surface fans is that we want to save nim! nim has taken all of our hearts away and then nbc just cuts them in two. come on nbc, just give surface one more season!

it's not often that a tv series grabs me right off the bat; a recent chance download of the pilot for surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode, after which i immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything i could about this wonderful series. to my chagrin, i found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. such a shame.since then, i've acquired the remaining episodes, and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television i've ever watched. just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, i loved how they ended every episode with a huge finish. i imagine watching it each week i would've been screaming with tension and just captivated, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. growing up, i always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it, ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode.well, it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off, and apparently the people behind the show must've seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things definitely take a turn for the worse. i wouldn't say the episodes actually become boring but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clichéd, and i've got to say, the final episode really left me feeling cheated. i just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance. the *only* other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of stargate sg-1, which just resonated tremendously, feeling very "true", soulful and made from the heart. surface was a great series, and maybe one day, some well-heeled tv lover will see all the outpouring of emotion about the show's cancellation, and bring back this show. one can hope, at least. :)

***spoilers*** whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, surface is superbly crafted. the cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art. conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans). close encounters of the third kind by way of creature from the black lagoon with a bit of jaws and godzilla thrown in for good measure, say. and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here. this series surfaced, seemingly, from out of nowhere and, by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling, carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season. all things considered, a job very well done. i only hope it resurfaces next season...

what can i say? i got up this morning and turned on sci-fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out. strange, unusual, and brilliant. it gives all potential, and to think at first i said this looks stupid. this has got to be the next best thing since x-files, but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion. i am telling you, it's scary and then suspenseful and then mellow. towards the end you have miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species. you have two people on the run from authorities. and a killer tsunami about to strike! wow! and did i mention miles pet is a potential killer(well the rest of his species is). surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that delivers it all.

john huston, actor and director better known for more robust fare such as "the misfits" and "african queen," directs his daughter, angelica huston, in what would be his last film. indeed, the film was released after huston's death. based on james joyce's novella of the same name, "the dead" tells the quiet story of a new year's celebration in 1904 dublin. huston, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son tony, have created a gem of a movie. the novella is among joyce's finest works (as well as being the only one that is filmable). the film is a tribute to huston's genius. he has taken a small,beautiful story and has made a small, beautiful movie. donal mccann and angelica huston shine (although "shine" is too showy, too flashy a word to describe their quiet, understated performances). "the dead" reflects the huston family's love for ireland and is, in its own quiet way, a fitting final movie for a legend.

writers and directors, by the nature of their craft, stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations. here, huston and joyce have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. until it's very end the movie appears to be about nothing much, the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life. it is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything.it is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity, and also deep affection, for oneself and the rest of fellow beings.

because of the depth of his character studies and complexity of story lines, james joyce's works do not easily translate into film. yet john huston, in his last film before his death, achieved a perfect translation of joyce's story. he received great support from his son, as writer, and daughter, as actress.

"the dead" truly is a work of art. clearly, john huston meant to show that he was still "in the full glory of some passion" by making it, even as his body was failing him. this movie is powerfully affecting and lingers in the mind long after it is done. reading the joyce short story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this film. as a statement by an artist of his love of life and his craft, "the dead" stands alone.

john huston made many remarkable and memorable films. those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987. it was that year, however, that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella "the dead." once long ago, a very wise man called doc asked me, "doesn't "the dead" seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in dubliners?" i tend to think that it is. the story and film both contain some of joyce's societal comments and criticisms, but for the most part, paint a warm and loving portrait of an ireland joyce himself so often railed against and would shortly leave. huston's handling of protagonist gabriel conroy, who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion, is simply remarkable. to claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point. as with any of joyce's dubliners, plot--while most certainly present--is not the focus. plot is merely a tool for the conveyance of the protagonist's epiphany. in addition to a seeming lack in action, there is quite frankly little dialogue in joyce's short story for the director to lean on. huston's ability to translate what joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie's greatest triumph. feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal. to claim that huston has softened his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark. while "the dead" may be painted with a cheerful hue, the complacency and pretense of the film's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale: we are the toddling old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with the sore throat; the wife with the sad, rain soaked secret; even the self-deluded middle-aged man. but "the dead" belies its title. it is not a dark story. nor is it really that bleak. forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it; forget the shambles of a life gabriel awakes to at the film's end: it is only with the destruction of the illusions gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward. such is the central point of the film. such is the central point of our lives.

saw this film at the nft in london where it was showing as part of the bfi's john huston season. i wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away. in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away! no real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, except for a short section at the very end, no scenery.the result of lack of all of these features was, however, a wonderful film. i don't fully understand why, but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect. the acting, script and, most important of all, the casting were all spot on and i can't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good, but i still can't work out why. i just know that i will be getting the dvd (this is one of those films that will, i am sure, be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience, provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it!) and i will be watching it again soon. i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it. i'm sure that it will not be everybody's choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my view.9 out of 10.

the argentinian music poet, atahualpa yupanqui, once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world. they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music...this film, as i feel it, is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history. first, a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it. then some, believe that they hear it, but they don't. then, nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it. and others recognize that they have heard it, but didn't think that others might be hearing it. finally, everybody listen to the same music, and suddenly it doesn't sound any more...love and poetry, as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children...why would he call the film, the dead when nobody dies? the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it dubliners, following james joyce's title...a nice 1900 irish filmed postcard!

james joyce, arguably, could write some of the best sentences in the english language, and his short story, "the dead," which ends his collection the dubliners, containsin its finaleperhaps the most perfect paragraph in the english language. it's fitting that john huston, who held back in attempting to film this story, ended his career with it. as with the red badge of courage and the man who would be king, huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. and with "the dead" (which was completed after huston's death by his son, tony huston) we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema.valuing all that cinema can do, as one of the commentators points out "this isn't the african queen" (nor does it need to be), this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience. all of us slogged through portrait of an artist in school, and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us. as with silent films, huston seeks something pure here, and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals joyce's original.many veterans of the irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with self-importance (and mock self-doubt) that's reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the feast of the epiphany. what's in store for gabriel conroy is an evening of celebration, song, dance, poetry where he's asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party. he's distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion, and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earth-shattering experience, handed to him by his wife. while his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it's also a gift where all that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who are living.and rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story "cinematic," huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch "the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling." it's the perfect solution to a filmmaker's adaptation.the cast is all we would hope. since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience each performer seems elevated by their role. anjelica huston as gretta conroy has a wide range to play, and her account of a young boy who once loved her sears not only gabriel conroy, but the audience as well.when i think of anjelica huston, it's the transformation she makes in this film; and when i think of her father, it's this film i remember first.

i've been waiting years for the dead to come out on video, having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds. this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. it takes place on the feast of the epiphany (twelfth night), and is a simple, poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women. central to the story is a fairly loveless couple, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. all of the performances are stunning, and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully. of course, its source material is james joyce's short story of the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact. john huston's long career as one of hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film, which was scripted by his son, tony huston; stars his daughter, anjelica huston; and is dedicated to his wife, maricella. thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd. for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate, subtle, yet incredibly moving holiday film, this is a true gem.

naturally in a film who's main themes are of mortality, nostalgia, and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones. however there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy. the pace is steady and constant, the characters full and engaging, the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion, screams to show fear, shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger. naturally joyce's short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly. it is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.

this is really the only chance to see the magic of james joyce's writing brought to life. his novels are all unfilmable (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. it was john huston's last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died, and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. the dead is poetical in its approach on the screen, telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the ira and "the troubles" could ever hope to tell us. hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both john huston and james joyce, and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper).

i believe john houston's "the dead" is a true classic. not only was it houston's final film, he is quoted as saying "all i know about film making is in this film." the story, closely adapted from "dubliners" by james joyce, is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by angelica houston, john's daughter, and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life. this is a film that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very appealing. the film is not hurried, nor is it charged with action. rather, the story unfolds from within the characters, who bring light and meaning to the dialog. the end of the film is stunning, poetic, and haunting. i recommend "the dead" without reservation as one of the finest films ever made.

not often it happens that a great director´s last movie becomes such a moving, brillantly performed and filmed masterpiece. the cast is excellent as well as the camerawork. what starts up as a merry coming-together of a group of well-educated citizens of an early-20th-century- dublin turns into a dark, philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. thank you, mister huston, for this last piece of great cinema!

in print this is one of the greatest short stories ever written, brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this father-son team, working together, sadly, for the first and last time.it is fitting that john huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite author's to the screen, in what is easily the best joyce screen adaptation. huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film, usually quite successfully. it is sad, and somewhat puzzling, that tony huston pretty much began and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and picking up a well-deserved oscar nomination in the process.i once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter/playwright horton foote, who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at the time it was still a fairly recent release). as a rather prolific screenwriter himself (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works, as well as great authors such as faulkner, steinbeck and harper lee) he was obviously impressed with tony huston's first time effort, and possibly equally puzzled by his lack of output since then. if anyone has insights to share on the topic i'd be interested to hear more.

for his last film, john huston directed his daughter, anjelica, in this adaptation of the story from james joyce's "dubliners", and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him by.joyce is about as impossible to film as anyone, but "the dead" at least presents a traditional narrative to work with. much (indeed, almost all) of the important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines, in characters' thoughts and expressions -- there are big moments, but they're cerebral -- they're not the stuff of which movies are made. but somehow, huston gets it right, and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation.anjelica is magnificent, and the movie is haunting and powerful.grade: a

there are so many '10 best' lists which could easily fit "the dead" - best screen drunk, best literary adaptation, best use of music not specifically written for the film, best use of poetry, best screen speech, best ensemble cast and finally, perhaps, best film ever made. this was john huston's last and greatest film, adapted by his son tony from james joyce's short story and set on the evening of the feast of the epiphany in the dublin of 1904. it is confined, largely, to one setting, the home of the morkan sisters, and not a great deal happens in conventional 'dramatic' terms. they entertain their guests; there is singing, dancing, recitations and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company.finally, of course, it is 'about' much, much more. it is about love, loss and regret, those stable mainstays of great drama. in the film's closing scenes the tenor bartell d'arcy, (frank patterson), sings a song, 'the lass of aughrim' which conjures up in the mind of gretta, (anjelica huston), wife of gabriel, (donal mccann), the ghost of her first and probably greatest love, a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life, after all. emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, firstly as gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then as the voice in gabriel's head sums up his own feelings. this is great cinema, the monologues superbly delivered by huston and mccann.but then all the performances are extraordinary. this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another, has the screen ever given us a more likable, genial or convincing drunk than donal donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean mcclory, (the ira man in "the quiet man"), brings to his reading of lady gregory's translation of 'donal og' here? added poignancy is to be had, of course, from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his life's work. death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a life-enhancing experience.

john huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies i've ever seen. for his farewell he decided to adapt james joyce's beautiful short story, "the dead", and made not only one of the most faithful literature-to-film adaptations yet, he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema.when i watched this movie a few years ago, as a student at university, i gazed in awe at the screen, marvelling at every aspect of the movie: acting, screen writing, direction, costumes, settings, music, cinematography. thinking about it now, i still can't of anything i'd criticise it for. huston just knew how to tell a good story.a good deal of credit should also go to tony huston. he knew better than to meddle with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema. father and son let the story breathe and relish in the long, fascinating conversations between characters, and in the meaningful silences.donal mccann also deserves credit for the his performance as gabriel conroy. i had never seen him in movies before, nor have i seen him afterwards, but he gave one of the most moving performances i've ever seen.all in all, the dead is a fine cinematic experience, from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent.

easily one of my three or four favorite films. definitely one for the desert island. there is nothing `brilliant' about this film. rather, it glows warm and welcoming. the audience is invited to a party and, like any good party, the joy comes in the interaction of the guests, and what you learn as you progress from one to the next. with apologies to joyce, the film's title conjures up a number of ideas that keep audiences away. the film is not horrifying. it is not depressing. it is a beautiful look into a time that has past, within which people are growing up, and others are winding down. some are frustrated, and others are serene. and all around, ever present throughout the evening, are the people, and the parts of people, that have been laid to rest. the words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and, set to the music of the irish brogue, are an auditory feast, particularly to us flat-toned americans. about the lack of brilliance i referred to above, i take it back. there is no other word to describe the final scene between anjelica huston and donal mccann. it speaks quiet volumes about  well, everything. some lovely snowy evening, rent this film and just let it happen before you. no gunfights, no car chases, no dinosaurs  just film at its most sublime.

the last film of john huston, the great american director of the irish descent is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection "dubliners", of the greatest writer ever came from ireland. the film is a family affair. the dying director made it based on the script adapted by his son tony huston from one of the most poignant, beautiful and profound short story ever written in this language and considered by many the best english language short story. john directed his daughter anjelica in what could be her finest screen performance. the film is short, only 83 minutes. it's got no action sequences, no plot, it is almost non-eventful, and it may seem slow. the guests, friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in dublin during the epiphany week in january 1904, at the house of two elderly sisters who give annual dinner with music and dance. what viewers see for the first hour, is the ensemble conversation piece. the guests talk, listen to the music, discuss the latest opera premiere, and make jokes, sometimes awkward. gradually, the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away.this is the film you have to stay with, let it pull you in, listen to what and how the guests at the party say, how they communicate. pay attention to the body languages, to the looks at their faces when they drift away from the light, laugh, and music of the present to the long gone but never in fact left most precious memories where the dead of the title are not dead but forever young and so alive. if you do, you will be awarded with the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you. it will break your heart to pieces, pull them together and put it back transfixed. the film as well as joyce's story centers on gabriel conroy (donal mccann as james joyce's alter ego gave a very moving understated performance) as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife gretta (anjelica huston). gabriel is still in love, feels close connection to and fascinated with her. it is after the party, he discovers that even after many years of closeness, he does not know all about her past, her pains, her regrets, and the unforgettable emotions and loss she had lived through as a young girl, and he is no part of. for the first time, he looks at her and thinks of her not as the indelible part of his existence but as another human being with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time, "a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul." it is he who narrates the final most powerful and profound lines of the story: "snow is general all over ireland. . . falling faintly through the universe, and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead." if you have not seen the film or read the joyce's story, please do. they are truly the works of art that leave the everlasting impression and would change something in you to the best.

it's a short movie for such immense feelings. the last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry. huston (john) is dying and only love can make the difference. the actor's work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous.

an exquisite film. they just don't make them like this any more! we eavesdrop on an upper middle class family in dublin in the early part of the 20th century. they are hosting an after christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed. away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests. perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film. no real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers.

so many literary adaptations are disappointments. there are many reasons for that, but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. the dead is unusual - it had to be 'padded', as the short story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. it may in fact be the finest short story in the english language. in beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of gabriel conroy that his life, and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him.to bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. john huston did a magnificent job. he never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story. it is simple and true, with outstanding acting. the only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy.its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece, but i think its fair to use this term for this movie. its not a bravura piece of film making, but it is simple and pure - i always think of ozu's movies when i think of the dead, its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.

the entire movie, an artful adaptation of one of joyce's "dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of january 6 (epiphany), 1906. most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece), where a group of upper-class dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. while there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. the cast, all talented irish stage actors with the exception of anjelica huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. the poignant final scene, between ms. huston and the amazing donal mccann, reveals much about the marriage of the characters. there is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, "the dead" is highly recommended. my wife is from dublin, we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every january 6th. after many viewings it never fails to move me, and each time i glean something that i've missed before.

i have watched thousands of movies in my life and i believe this movie is the most "perfect" movie that has ever been made. by perfect i mean the storytelling, the plot, the acting, the staging, the camera work, etc. (this is a lay opinion; i have no background in film production.) a lot of movies have perfect scenes, such as the bartender filing a report with the police officer in the movie fargo. (indeed, that scene could play well as a short.) in the dead every scene is done to perfection, making the entire movie perfect. perhaps, john huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. hopefully, daniel webster has gotten him out of the contract!

john huston was seriously ill when he made his final achievement,and it's thoroughly his testament:uncompromising,difficult ,a thousand miles away from crazes and fashions,it will stand as the best "last film" you can ever dream of.a very austere screenplay,no action,no real hero,but a group of people coping with the vanity of life,the fleeting years and death.the party doesn't delude people for long.admittedly,warmth and affection emanate from the songs and the meal,complete with turkey and pudding.but the passage of time has partly ruined julia's voice,first crack in the mirror.then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches the old lady's bedroom.for sure,hers seems to have been a happy life,but it's a life inexorably coming to an end-a shot shows towards the end of the movie julia on her future deathbed-.maybe an unfulfilled life,because she remained a spinster,with no children to carry on .only some poor things,yellowish photographs,bibelots and trinklets.... but are a human being's hopes and dreams all fulfilled?look at gretta.she 's a married woman ,about thirty-five,she's still beautiful and healthy but she knows something is broken.what julia is today,she will be tomorrow,that's why,in her stream of consciousness,she goes back to her past,only to find out how harrowing her memories are: a young man committed suicide for her,a symbol of her youth now waning.the final monologue,if we listen closely to it,involves us all in this eternal tragedy,the doomed to failure human condition,john huston's masterly lesson.

this is my favourite movie of all time. and i always think of it as john huston's requiem.i must have seen it at least 20 times and never tire of it. the mood, the script, the singing, the dinner, it is like being invited into someone's home and observing the events and not able to participate even though you want to... it is a rare treasure, this movie and i cannot write enough praise for it.it is cast incredibly well, with quite a few abbey theatre faces and also the wonderful tenor voice of frank patterson. lady gregory's poem recited in the movie is one of the most moving ever written. anjelica's scene walking down the stairs as she listens to the song is one of the best performances every seen on film. i cry every time i see it..for all the right reasons.we have all had love lost at an early age and weep for our young hopeful selves.donal mccann acted in far too few movies for my liking, he just loved stage work and stuck to it, and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances on film as he does so much with this delicate role by expression and the portrayal of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he conveys such inner sadness at knowing this.if you want your movies action and plot packed avoid this, there really is no beginning, middle or end just a lens onto the characters at a dinner party in dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shadings of the personalities portrayed so beautifully.bravo to all who were involved in this production. 10 out of 10.

mishima - a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day. mesmorizing cinematography, accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture. as any gifted character, mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts, the main of them being the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings, living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of mishima himself.all schrader's films (and the ones he wrote scripts for) are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in. that also goes for mishima, who, apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words. his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play. film like this comes along once in a long while, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10!!

the only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.so says mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and "the wizard of oz". these stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to reinforce, the slow fusing of mishima's life with his fictions, until the end(or the beginning) when like the ancient samurai he so admires, he will be at a balance of pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is a full and "pure" being).paul schrader wrote the screen play for "taxi driver", and directed "cat people"(a bizarre erotic horror film, which left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in mishima, he comes closest to making a really excellent film.whats interesting is to watch the poet, the homosexual, the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 (of which he seems forever ashamed), become a body building, samurai obsessed, a-sexual, media phenomena, all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels, plays, and short stories.a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father, and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself, that he was always missing. watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets, you see him happy, delivering his big paternal speech, giving orders, and loving the control...until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. though the story, fascinating at times, really isn't this movies greatest success. the cinematography, performances, editing,music(by philip glass), and set designs, are really what make this worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-pic.one day i will pick, up a mishima book, he does seem to have an ear for prose, and for staging ideas, but for now i'm satisfied with the film.those interested in japanese literature, and post-war culture, should check out. fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions, should enjoy as well.

the cinematography is the film's shining feature. park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. i hope there's a blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. it's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for his vision. sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight. he doesn't, however, have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror.although i've never seen the film, i couldn't help but feel like this was chan-wook park's version of twilight. the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sang-hyeon's and tae-joo's love for one another. it felt like the adult version of twilight, really. there's a lot of blood, nudity, sex, and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure. maybe it's the chan-wook park fanboy in me, but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two. the psychological aspect that i love about park's previous films is in thirst, as well. that's a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite. the soundtracks to park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove. thirst is no exception. while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around, it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly.the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film. it's weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it's hard to imagine thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut. nevertheless, it is my one nitpick of the film.chan-wook park bites into the vampire mythology with thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it. park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: great writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, some sort of psychological twist that'll mess with your head, and a memorable ending. thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd (and eventually blu-ray, hopefully).

i wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews, and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result. softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films, in my opinion, allowed the narrative to take the focus. though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace, i felt like many of the other things were not. for example:how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her.the very strong and well acted love scenes.the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more.their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their prior life experiences.the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie.i've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films'. of course. however, i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well. i don't need a director to use new tricks. i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately, which i feel is the case with this film. i recommend it.

they say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination, dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.that was not the case when i watched bakjwi, under the american title thirst. now playing at select theaters near you. seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details. there will be blood in this film and you will try to look away.for rest of review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.

the definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting. being an r rated movie, i knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires. which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to twilight. having viewed chan-wook park's preceding oldboy, i had very high expectations of bakjwi.i anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti-hero, known as priest sang-hyeon, and was very impressed by his performance as a holy-man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire. (spoiler) after the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion, he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability. the screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition. he starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons. the oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative tae-joo is very riveting as they are played by the host's kanh-ho song and actress ok-vin kim. the special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn't offer anything new in the ways of stunts and cgi, it didn't impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise. the story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own korean style. there aren't many negatives i can say about bakjwi. sometimes i ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation, but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long. the movie was long to begin with. on the same token, vampires really don't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with. as mentioned before, this movie is very tragic, so don't expect anything hopeful while watching this. overall, bakjwi is delightfully dark, morbid and original. i strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of twilight. this is definitely the korean answer to the swedish let the right one in, which is also a good movie.

i hate vampire movies. with that said, this one was very interesting to me. i do want to point out one thing tho. "bakjwi" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva. we also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be "exceptional." as i watched the film, i realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat-vampire connection.duality of human nature = if you ever read aesop's fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage. mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story.the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex. sang-hyun's blind priest friend, sang-hyun's effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire, tae-ju playing both sides, her ordinary boring life vs. her thrill seeking vampire adventure, etc (won't ruin too much, u have to watch the film) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark-comedy,tragedy, vengeance, you name it!i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long, but this film is very fresh and new, something that i haven't seen b4 yet. i wouldn't say this is cw park's best work, but it is mos. def. the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing!

we all know what chan-wook park can do. if you haven't seen oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century. but i'm not here to talk about them. i'm here to talk about thirst.this movie is not what you would expect. yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. i wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer. chan-wook park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception. with some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting, he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene. the movie does start a bit slow, but i felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll. "thirst" is predominantly a love story, but not in the same sense that you would think. the relationship between the lead characters is very intense, but at the same time almost disturbing. chan-wook park is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy. the end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie, and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film i have seen.overall this is an exceptional film that i feel all movie buffs should see. it is an exciting(and admittedly different) take on the world of vampires, and the romance is far from sappy or boring. this movie is gritty, selfless, and beautiful in all the wrong ways. obviously it is not for everyone, but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested. see it. do not hesitate

i'm the first to recognize that chan-wook park's thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with tae-joo(ok-vin kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time. sang-hyeon(kang-ho song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously. instead of legitimately dying, hyeon becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood). sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to hyeon for a length of time. hyeon falls in lust with tae-joo, the wife of sickly childhood friend kang-woo(ha-kyun shin). tae-joo was taken in by mrs. ra(hae-sook kim), regarded as a puppy, and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around. ta-joo is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she instigates with hyeon, soon manipulating him into perhaps killing kang-woo by having him believe she's a victim of abuse. renouncing his priesthood, hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with tae-joo, soon a willing participant in killing kang-woo. this incident, which tae-woo contributed to(..using a boat, in the middle of a lake, both proceeded to burying him underwater, tae-woo keeping him kang-woo from re-surfacing as he attempted to re-enter)will haunt both, as circumstances arise with kang-woo "missing"(hyeon got rid of him, where police would not find his corpse). soon mrs ra suffers a stroke(..though, one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses, showing that she more aware than they are led to believe), and hyeon gives tae-joo a special birthday gift..vampirism. in doing so, hyeon has created a monster. tae-joo admits(..though a slip of the tongue)that, in fact, kang-woo never hurt her, and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically. tae-joo becomes such a hand full, hyeon has to take desperate measures if he is to stop such a menace to society, himself included.i will say that thirst is one of the best horror films i've seen regarding 2009. it's a methodical approach park takes and we are led down a dark road with hyeon and tae-joo, as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union. innocent people die because of hyeon's love(..what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for tae-joo, and it will cease to end if he doesn't make a painful choice. we see inside their heads, their souls, and it isn't always pretty. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting..but, credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people. hyeon, seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening, accepts "hell" for tae-joo so one could look at thirst as a unique love story, but not exactly a healthy one.in regards to the violence, while park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details, there's enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit. at the very least, the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact. the sexual situations between hyeon and tae-joo can be pretty heated and erotic, while also sordid and morally reprehensible. the movie, i think, is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affection(lust).

the priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/and the love of femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. she did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. fragile, but lovely femme fatale! this movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. also i thought about love. adam was not so responsible for eve's but this adam(priest), sacrificial and responsible to pick eve up from the paradise lost, vampire's world. another symphonic poem of adam & eve, paradise lost.

there's this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off-screen. park chan-wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of. leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across. whether it's long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mah-jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes, dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them, park doesn't keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couple's relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self-annihilation--and uses vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama. it's that simple, and that complex, at the same time.you gotta give him credit. too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to twilight, with twilight almost always being the lesser of the works, but here the stories are actually comparable, but this one is more raw and honest. none of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap, but anything ranging from the dirtiest, most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another. it's the same deal--guy and girl meet, girl finds out guy is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but with no happily ever after, just straight-up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options. the girl's motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention, to a fault, foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances, but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that he's merely using his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral training.the movie isn't perfect and it does tend to stretch (there's no three act, five act, or any act structure here, just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance), but what's great about it is that park chan-wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore. he also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high-notes in a pretty effective way, too.--polarisdib

a beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire. physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life. the one-time priest falls deeper in despair and depravity. as things turns for worse, he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanity...the vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the twilight and underworld franchises, but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire, by putting simple things into perspective.these vampires have reflections, and no fangs, but still feed and die the same. making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts. the priest primarily feeds to make himself better, but when he meets his friends unfulfilled wife, carnal instincts set in.what makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time, they are experiencing something they have never before, forbidden passion, which makes the scenario all that more sensual.chan-wook adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie. we see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realises her own strength, just puts the chair down and carry on. hilarious.and the final act wouldn't be out of place in a carry on film, or even the three stooges as the couple fight for survival/death respectively.cgi is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful, you could be watching ballet.the vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this, but more importantly, has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days. it's violent, but from the director in question, i wouldn't expect anything different.a really interesting story, with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.

this is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by hoagy carmichael and frank loesser with a standout number, we're the couple in the castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to penthouse serenade just as the opening premise (hoppity's coming) may well have inspired fred saidy and yip harburg's opening (woody's coming) in finian's rainbow six years later. i totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect. it's wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects barely noticed in the 'real' world assume a much greater significance - both pro and con - in the insect world. actually it is a classic, albeit a minor one.

while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. when this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) warner brothers and ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney dominance. back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when disney was serving cinematic banquets like snow white, dumbo and fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers dave and max fleischer. despite releasing two very commendable films, they never quite cornered the market  many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town, released the same week as the attack on pearl harbour (which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!) that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty.in a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger. humans use the land as a shortcut, discarding litter and cigars, and other hazards, right on top of the bugs' homes as they go. honey-shop owner mr bumble (voiced by jack mercer) fears that the future is bleak, and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter honey (voiced by pauline loth) in more secure surroundings. a highly unscrupulous creature, bagley c. beetle (voiced by tedd pierce), offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage, but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart, the perennially cheerful and optimistic hoppity (voiced by stan freed). hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better, but is left looking foolish when bagley beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end. only at the very end, as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper, do the bugs switch loyalty back to hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of humans.what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation  all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. the bumbling villains swat the fly and smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. equally admirable is the storytelling drive  even the youngest of children can enjoy this story, while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife. time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and when viewing it the audience needs to accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished, funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot.

wow. i saw this movie and "up" on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. i saw "mr bug" first, and was then totally disappointed in "up"'s follow-up. what a beautiful and touching film! movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog, but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. and the soft "organic" lines of 30s drawing and the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little (but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. the interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heel wearers, innocent kick-the-can playing kids) to the kind-hearted, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. you care for the bugs, and dick and mary. the protagonist hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to "set things right" but a starry-eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally!), and every time you think it's going to end happily in 1930s style, along comes another roadblock...! i was on the edge of my seat much more than with "up." i walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling: something that hasn't happened in a long long long long time!

what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here, is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film. while courtenay's character is evidently gay, he is not the only one: the often talked about mr. davenport-scott is the other, and the reason that he is never seen, the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in england at the time.we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman, courtenay's character: and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby, the edward fox character, the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters, and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it. the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through, if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to. the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to 'step into the footlights', as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids, a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment.so while the drama is of the decline of finney's sir, a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw' of courtenay's gayness, and makes this a film about him, as the title suggests.the art direction, pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time, more distant than the eighties and, in some ways, even than the second world war. the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order, of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant, for all its flaws.

anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will lovethis film. taken from ronald 'taking sides' harwood, it's a funnyand ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between twovery 'actorly' types. albert finney is sublime as the despoticshakespearean actor who barely notices the world war ragingaround him, so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatrecompany and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.tom courtenay is matchless as norman, the 'dresser' of the title,whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.really a must see.

lcdr tom dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: maverick does not mean "tom cruise". maverick means "non-conformist".), is actually an intelligence operative for the vice admiral of his submarine fleet. the vice-admiral is concerned about our old friends the russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. countries like lybia, north korea or iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into norfolk harbour or mayport, florida. and this was 6-7 years before 9/11.the admiral assigns dodge to assume command of a moth-balled wwii diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the uss orlando, a top of the line fast attack sub. dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears.. err i mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors. despite having "welcome aboard" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and fair commander, he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. the us navy could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under-appreciated gem from the creator of "police academy".

surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features kelsey grammer (supposedly in his first lead role in a feature) as an unconventional navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he has earn it by competing against the u.s. navy in a series of war-games with a crew of untested, questionable, and lovable men (and a woman, too).director david s. ward ("major league") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well. second, besides the grammer character, most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movie's humor, which is treated like a double-edged sword. three members of the supporting cast - harland williams, toby huss, and rob schneider provide the funniest scenes, which includes weird gestures, impersonations, and, well, their personalities."down periscope" is more than a navy version of "police academy" or "the dirty dozen". what the film does is get the job done the right way and i liked it.

starring: kelsey grammar, rob schneider, lauren holly, rip torn this movie is a classic family favorite. at least for most members of my family that is. one of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks, "what a stupid movie." i'm not that person though. i still find this movie highly amusing. i just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it, and i laughed just as hard as the first time i watched it. it's still very funny to me.naval captain tom dodge (grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the navy. he's the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub, cracking a ball onto a golf course while they sail past it. he's the kind of guy who will get drunk, pass out, and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. he's not the kind of guy that everybody wants to be commanding a sub.but dodge is at the end of the line. he's put in applications to get command of his own sub several times, and if he doesn't get a sub this time, he's headed for a desk job, meaning that's it for naval life. the admiralty decide to give him his own boat, but they don't give him a new nuclear sub. they give him a diesel sub, an ancient relic from world war ii. his mission is to clean her up and take her out on the atlantic for a war game.dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he's worked so hard to get to the point that he's at, so he goes and talks to admiral winslow (torn) about it. winslow explains the purpose of the war game. diesel subs are still being sold out there in the real world, to countries like iran, iraq, and libya, to name a few. winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain in a diesel sub came to the states and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. would they make it? dodge and most of the admiralty don't think so, but winslow wants to know for sure, hence why he has devised this war game. dodge's mission is to take the stingray out to sea, then try to evade the u.s. nuclear navy and blow up the american naval bases. in simulated battle, of course.so, that's about as deep as the plot gets. this is not a plot driven movie. it's a stupid movie that is just a big gag. it makes fun of itself, and you are not expected to take it seriously. if you're looking for good dumb laughs on a friday night, i'd urge you to check it out.bottom line: 3 out of 4 (worth a look)

there was a recent documentary on making movies, that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies. one common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.down periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. not an original or terribly well written screenplay. a few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! it would be easy to just say that kelsey grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case. other character actors, like rob schneider, and the hilarious harland williams, added significantly to the enjoyability of the film.cast dynamics, or that mysterious "movie magic" are really what happened here, creating a film that flows smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line of well written and well performed dialog.a preposterous premise, lots and lots of technical inaccuracies and just plan silly things that could not happen in the real world, or the real navy, but you just don't care. as a merchant marine myself, i found that the overall feel of the movie, while not plausible, was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes.this is a very funny movie, a good family film, and, particularly if your a fan, lots of kelsey grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn funniness.

i'm glad they finally released it on dvd. i bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year.grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success. its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny nonetheless. i am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings.it ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. it's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. and sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.

this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. this movie is practically mchale's navy for the 90s or police academy at sea. grammer proves he can play roles other than frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the navy in order to get his own sub. rob schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and lauren holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it. many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.

i've enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it in the theatre. some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. the characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. the situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. the tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. the movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through. this is a feel good movie as good as they come.what amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining. the music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies, which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder. the scenes in the credits are a great music video of "in the navy", which deserve their own full screen special feature. the scenes and cuts are crafted well, and the casting and acting is right on.this movie is a classic as great as any ever made, without any pretensions. in fact, the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch. i love these guys and gal.the other day i thought of the film, and wondered whether it was available on dvd. good fortune has come to us, and the dvd came out in may 2004. i headed to the store, and snapped up a copy. then my wife and i enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen. i've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels, far better than many high budget films and oscar winners. this is entertainment.listen up fox home video: you have a great movie in your vaults, and it's a shame to find a cheap shot dvd with badly degraded off tint colors only 8 years since release. so why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? i'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right. i'm grateful to have my own copy. now give us the eye candy that the film deserves, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature.

i would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film. it really does grip you. john paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings.i imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children leaving home older but i wouldn't say wiser) with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery.i think this film should definitely have a wider audience. i would also say that the other actors played brilliant parts as well. it is such a deep film and very moving.

i just watched the dvd of this award winning film. one life stand is a stark drama that through it's pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very compelling and honest picture. it's a story about life's dilemma's around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. the mother (very well acted by maureen carr) is uptight and drawn in on herself. the father only appears on the side-lines, and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama. money is hidden in boxes and shoes.the writing was superb, and i liked the sensual close-up shots of details such as nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors etc. the way the camera was used made it very intimate. it's a harrowing tale, with sexual undertones, while the glasgow drizzle on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters.there are some highly memorable shots conveyed simply by a walk, or a dropped shoulder - such as trise walking away under the bridge. and the stunned and hurt look on trise's face in the call centre, which hopes to helps people through using tarot cards, as she listens to a caller talk of her own abuse.at the start we see john paul, wide-eyed and innocent, having photos shot as he wants to try modelling. trise, his mother, is deluded and making poor choices for him, in a way pushing him away while she tries to keep him. john paul's modelling turns into escort work and trise's boss offers her money, and eventually they go on a date. there are also moments of humour and subtle irony. one excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal, and starting to open up a bit, when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything over. but this, and other things offer moments of hope.i felt at times the pacing of the film was a shade too intense, but this is a small detail in another wise challenging and memorable film, and something a bit different. it stands in start contrast to most american films which are either total fantasy, or the real' world' as seen through tainted glasses. this film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. this isn't 'light entertainment' but a thought provoking and real life drama.one life stand is a truly involving and emotionally honest film.

all budding filmmakers should watch this movie - it is like a masterclass in digital film- making in itself. some of the scenes look like they have been shot on much higher production values than what they really have been. it is very encouraging that such a well crafted piece of work can be made on a low budget. the acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, particularly that of the lead boy (john kielty), who manages to play a teenager experiencing difficulties whilst remaining really likable. his beautiful but fading mother was also very well portrayed, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. this is a very quirky, interesting piece and i will be looking for anything else made by the same team. the director is certainly one to watch.

seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. mean, gripping, moody and captivating. every home should have a copy! don't take my word for it see it yourself. one life stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. john kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. this is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years. no car chases, but a film packed with hum our and emotion. i first saw this film screened at the edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on dvd.

a truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life. it could be set in any town in the uk. i live in a housing estate in glasgow and can relate to this film very well.sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.the actors are scarily believable, i felt as if i was spying on my neighbours. it was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. i was very moved by a few scenes.i loved the way this film was shot.overall this film is a must see.

i saw one life stand when it premiered at the 2000 edinburgh international film festival and was blown away by it. made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a european film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of dv. the film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. one life stand avoids falling into the trap of other uk realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes. the performances are strong, particularly maureen carr as the mother, trise. i understand the film has recently been released on dvd and i would definitely recommend it. the rating on this site is misleading, which is why i gave it a high score because the filmmaker, may miles thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing achievement.

have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. here's hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors,

i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. is that not what films are supposed to be about!? but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to. for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive, a lot can be learned from watching this film, technically it has everything going for it, the use of light, music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise. the actors performances are believable to a point, if not slightly under played, i felt there was much more in there, more depth, in particular from the male lead john paul clarke. but one thing that really does bother me, as a film maker myself, is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour? do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? or is this the future of wonderful, affordable film making?

one life stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. its imdb rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. the performances are excellent, particularly that of gary lewis who gets better with every role. my only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments. overall, though, it is a fine piece of work.

i have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas,but in the movies (1+2) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction. it is nice to see them fighting something other then ninja, and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra. and how other people from other land across the ocean fight. also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her. (she have truly become strong) it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i'm watching now. when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound. with new jutsus and garra in the movie, u know it is good. and the music was good as well, but i find it to be lacking something. but the ending theme song was a plus. (dind dong dang) i think was a really good song. i totally recommend it.all in all i give this movie a 10, because i just love it. if u do decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol

i'm a big fan of naruto, even though i haven't watched every episode or read every manga.i really liked the first naruto movie, and to tell you the truth i was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good (or action packed) as the first (mainly because this one in australia only had a pg instead of an m, which is a pg-13 us or 12 uk). but i was wrong (thankfully)! the animation was more improved (although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed) and was very good especially in the fight scenes.speaking of that, let's talk about the fight scenes! the animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! i especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with gaara fighting the shape shifting female warriors! all the characters you want are here! naruto, sakura, gaara, kankuro and shikamaru! if only temari was in the movie, shikamaru could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion! and maybe they could have a passionate kiss! in my summary at the top i say that this qualify's more as a piece of cinema than just an extended episode. and it does! the action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting! overall, this is a excellent anime film that is a must-see for any naruto fan! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! alright i'll stop!

i liked this movie, the second naruto feature film. i enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as i found the story here a bit disjointed as i was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. still, like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights. the story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants. it then shits to naruto, sakura, and shikumaru hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment. they soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor. they both are injured and taken in by a caravan and soon after naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a utopia. of course, all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around. my favorite was the one involving garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake. the concluding fight is rather good too involving naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie.

naruto the anime tv series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.the first one, which was released in the summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of naruto in an exciting adventure. however, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults. whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. naruto movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.the action first of all, was incredibly cinematic. the lighting, setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie. in the first we were given basic action, well animated and choreographed animation, but nothing eye popping, however this movie's cinematography was exceptional, the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting.the animation was very good. it rivalled disney, however since this is a movie about tv characters, there was nothing exceptionable about the character design or detail to the actual characters, however, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. i think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all, it was incredibly fluid.the music... i think that's where this movie fails. the original composer/conductor for the tv show was used for the film, and i don't really feel that he did that good of a job. the music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old snes games. the composer is very good, but the synthesisers used for the film couldn't convey the tune very well. however they didn't fail the film at all, adding as a good accompaniment to the action. but, except for a few violin/string pieces towards the end and some choral work, the music didn't excel any boundaries or act as anything special.the story was fun. it was a reasonably typical storyline for naruto and was very similar to the first movies, except, again, it took everything that had been wrong with the first film's story and improved upon them. the characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film. it kept making you think the film would be ending any second now, but then it would move on, but instead of feeling dragged out, the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and exciting.overall, this film is a goodun, but however good it might be, it is most definitely one for the fans. i enjoyed the film, but thats because... i'm a fan! but i can see, just like with final fantasy's advent children, it doesn't excel as a movie, but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half. though i think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current non-watchers, it won't give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to naruto screens. however, despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers.

the plot: michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. and, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch. the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. it must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. later years would bring similar films such as, singin' in the rain(1952) & dick van dyke-carl reiner's, the comic(1969). what is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. one of the greatest in the silent era, buster keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. but the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett's film legacy. it doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a "positive" reworking of mack sennett's and mabel normand's life. the character michael "linnett" connors is mack sennett, whose real name was michael sinnott. and molly, of course is mabel. sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and keystone cops. he worked with buster keaton, ben turpin(cameo), roscoe "fatty" arbuckle(body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. not only all that, but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. as most film viewers today prefer sound features, those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture. as mack sennett fell into that category, it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade! sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. his career started in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director & producer. he semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. he had worked with the best, such as charlie chaplin, gloria swanson, bing crosby, w.c. fields, keaton, harry langdon, arbuckle, and even roy rogers(in way up thar).as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career, mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next 25 years. in 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category, and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. in the 1940's his presence was still felt, e.g. here come the co-eds(1945)where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in mack's wandering willies(1926)is done. in 1947, the road to hollywood, used some of sennett's crosby films. 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated. with his knack of always associating with the right people, a guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk & his radio show came about later in the year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph, tillie's punctured romance(1914) with sound. in 1952 he was honored on tv's, this is your life, then his autobiography, the king of comedy(1954), which is a great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade, was published. 1955 brought a more concrete association with abbott & costello, as he had a cameo in a&c meet the keystone kops. finally in 1957, another tribute with the compilation film, the golden age of comedy. so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer. in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table. as we get to the silver haired mack, he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say, "here i am!". when he rises to give a speech a short while later, he is at his most subdued, underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey, "i know my influence on comedy will never end, but will people forget mack sennett the individual. maybe this movie will help."

"hollywood cavalcade" is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th century fox roster, don ameche and alice faye, and containing a couple of in jokes.the film concerns a max sennett type, michael connors (ameche) who brings an actress to hollywood, molly adair (faye) and makes her a big silent comedienne, eventually moving her into more dramatic roles. he becomes extremely successful with her as his star. obsessed with his work, he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man (alan curtis) run off and get married. he's so shocked, he dumps her. she and her husband go off and continue to be more and more popular while connors' studio starts losing money at an alarming rate. before you know it, he's through. molly wants to help and asks that connors direct her next film.there's lots of keystone kop type footage, which is quite funny, and some fantastic slapstick by buster keaton, who is wonderful. the film also has a scene from "the jazz singer" when the talkies take over. the in-joke, of course, has to do with rin tin-tin, for whom zanuck used to write. in one scene, rinny's trainer brings him in as a potential contract player for connors' studio. connors throws both of them out of his office. a few scenes later, rin-tin-tin is shown to be #1 box office. the role of the famous german shepherd in this film is played by rin tin-tin, jr., daddy having passed away in jean harlow's arms in 1932, one month shy of his 14th birthday. fortune smiled on him even at the end.alice faye is very pretty and does a fine job, as does ameche, who turns in an energetic performance. j. edward bromberg and stuart erwin provide very good support.unfortunately, this film isn't quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance, or drama. however, "hollywood cavalcade" is still quite watchable.

it's 1913. a studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. after inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. being completely absorbed in his film-making, however, he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. several over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down rin-tin-tin. fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego. he'll be okay as long as he still has his friends.this movie starts out as a mad-cap comedy typical of the time period, and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them. it has a playful lack of self-consciousness which is sorely missing in most of today's comedies. shortly into the film, however, it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film. these are silent slapstick comedies, well done but nothing out of the ordinary, and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals. upon returning, the film takes a dramatic turn. it's well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition, but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to be.by the end of the film, it has transformed once again - this time into a paean to the glitter of hollywood. the small town of los angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole world.in spite of its promising beginnings, this film has not aged particularly well. nevertheless, it does have some strong scenes, a certain nostalgic appeal, and an entertaining sub-text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for.

what makes this one better than most "movie movies" is that it doesn't feel phony. the film the story of the hot-headed director and his rise and fall and rise, by using real recognizable names and events during the silent and early sound eras. instead of the generic "sound will put us out of business" business, they actually show jolson and "the jazz singer". the acting is really quite good, with believeable performances from don ameche, alice faye and j. edward bromberg in particular.

i can remember seeing this movie when i was very young and several times on tv since then. i have always liked it. i have noticed on the print shown on local tv that one scene has reversed film. it is the one where they are hiding behind the rock outcrop(it looks like vasquez rocks near los angeles) watching the indians ride by. if you look carefully, you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are left-handed! it is only a short segment and i have to admit that it took me years to notice it.as far as history goes, there were often expeditions to rescue white captives from the indians. the direct connection for the final battle scene is the battle of beecher's island. in that action, a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines (spencer carbines not winchesters) were surprised by the indians and retreated to an island and held off several charges. in the last charge, they killed roman nose, one of the more famous indian chiefs. i have no idea if the writer of the script had this in mind but it does fit fairly well.there are several guy madison movies that i hope come out on dvd someday and this is one of them.

saw this film the first time in 1953 with my older brother. it was one of the great 3 demension films released in that era. we saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it. scott does a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the indian arrows rather than surround sound. oh, for those polaroid lenses again.

warner brothers produced this 3d extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. guy madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by indians, which essentially all there is to this film. the 3d format was in its early stages as a hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. the rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed. the indian weaponry comes at the audience non-stop throughout, and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown in for good measure. madison was quite popular as television's wild bill hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher who is given his thankless task by the army. for all the film's polish and presentation, the movie was made in just three days.

"the charge at feather river" is a routine western about the u. s. cavalry against the cheyenne indians... the film carried a constantly mounting tension with some pleasant diversion...guy madison and frank lovejoy play the officers who rescue helen westcott and vera miles from the indians...the outdoor scenes are well photographed, specially the exciting indian charge at feather river at the climax of the movie with the rain of spears, the fight to-the-death between madison and thunderhawk, the sketches of the guardhouse brigade, even a mouthful of tobacco juice used against a rattlesnake, and the romantic interludes between our hero and helen westcott... all are here, pictorially entertaining in 3-d and technicolor...

this neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century american films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. the actors are the best reason to see "black day, blue night." there is the late, great j.t. walsh ("swing blade," "pleasantville," "red rock west," "the last seduction," and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (see also "breakdown"). then there is michele forbes of the tv series "star trek: the next generation" and "homicide." (in a supporting role, there is even the late bejamin lum who also appeared on a star trek episode titled "the naked now.") a spoiler of sorts--a clue really: only the most innocent survive, but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this, and you probably won't guess who is innocent before the final reel.

"sir" has played lear over 200 times,but tonight he can't remember his opening lines.sitting at the mirror,his eyes reflect the king's madness. his dresser prompts him gently,mouthing the words.there is an air of desperation about both these men.the great actor knowing his powers are slipping away,his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss's decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing. "the dresser" is really a love story between the two.over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other. set during the second world war,it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second - rate touring shakespearean company comprising an equal number of has - beens and wannabes led by "sir", a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called "the old school".whatever part he is playing he grabs centre - stage and bellows out over the footlights,bullying his audience into applause.but,somewhere inside him,buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out,there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness.it is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for. mr a.finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham,often to the point of caricature,and,just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor. the same goes for mr t.courtenay.it's easy to write off his portrayalof norman as an exercise in stereotyping.here we have a middle - aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life,enjoying the company of "the girls" and loving the wicked insider gossip rife in "the theatre".there were - and i strongly suspect still are - many men just like norman in the profession.infinitely kind and patient,knowing more about the plays than many of the actors,they run backstage with wisdom and affection.i believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at mr courtenay's portrait. i saw "the dresser" on the london stage where,against the perceived wisdom,mr courtenay's "norman" was rather more subdued than in the movie."sir" was played by the great mr freddie jones to huge acclaim from the audience.it was a memorable performance that overshadowed mr courtenay's,reducing him rather to an "also - ran" as opposed to an actor on level - billing.the idea that "sir" and "norman" might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window. "norman" was reduced to being his puppet,which i'm not sure was what ronald harwood intended,but made for breathtaking theatre. messrs finney and courtenay redress the balance in the movie,restoring equality to the relationship. both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the british "new wave" pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely leftish,"middle - class and ashamed of it" movement.when the british cinema virtually committed hari - kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.with the renaissance of more substantial movies,they re - appeared,blinking in the unaccustomed bright light."the dresser" marked their return,still fizzing with energy and talent, shouting to the world at large "we're still here".it's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one.

this is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii. it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service. it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company, especially with his dresser. so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth. while tragic overall, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout. the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so. i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater--especially shakespeare, or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity. the backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers.

i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. it is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. if you don't know what the "black snake moan" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. and no.. it's not just a song. christina ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is samuel l jackson. i think this is his best performance since his role in pulp fiction, and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in bsm. the rest of the cast is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, particularly john cothran jr as reverend r. l.. i'm a very selective movie watcher, and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.

me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre screening i guess you would call it in atlanta, ga at atlantic station. walking in i was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. but the film is much more than that. it's a story of two people helping each other. it's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.it's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. thats the beauty of it. if it tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it carries itself through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good acting by ricci. although timberlake fails miserably in his role, the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side.i would definitely recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience.

just got back from seeing black snake moan. i had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator" ... i hate when "critics" miss the point of a film. now i suppose it helps that i live in memphis ... and have lived in mississippi a couple of times too. it may also help that i am the former director of the delta blues museum in clarksdale ... but i get this movie. brewer's simple "redemption tale" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but i believe it is highly effect as a "blues". it would be my hope that people don't read all the hype ... and/or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties ... get past justin timberlake, accept his character ronnis (which he plays very well) ... get past "snakes on a plane" and see how mercuricul samuel l. jackson is ... as he has transformed himself into a very believable mid-south blues man. if you know little about mid-south culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish ... but accept the fact that craig brewer knows how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film. not one to tell endings ... so go see this movie ... and yes i will agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!

working at a movie theater as a projectionist, i have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. when i first saw the trailer for 'black snake moan' i laughed and thought, "great. another 'snakes on a plane' samuel l jackson movie". but of course, i wanted to see it for the laugh factor. many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that justin timberlake is in the film. personally i loved every second of this movie. it tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. the story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. of course, i do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from sam jackson, christina ricci and,yes, even justin timberlake, i encourage you to see 'black snake moan'.

we just saw this film previewed before release at the norfolk (va) film forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: there were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. we saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between samuel jackson and cristina ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. what's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too "heavy" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. too bad. a good film wasted.

having just got the "loony tunes golden collection"(which i highly recommend, by the way), i'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. as such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.rabbit seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being "rabbit fire" and "duck! rabbit, duck). bags and daffy argue about who elmer fudd should short. it makes me laugh every single time!!! on the dvd it has a commentary, featurette, & option to play it music only.my grade: a+dvd extras: disk 1: an introduction by chuck jones; the boy of termite terrice part 1; clips from the films "two guys from texas" and "my dream is yours", both with bugs cameos; bridging sequences for an episode of "the bugs bunny show"; the astro nuts audio recording session; 2 vintage trailers; "blooper bunny: bugs bunny 51st and a half anniversary" with optional commentary with writer greg ford & stills gallery

strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. why? they are hilarious. this is hilarious. notice a lot of the quirky humor. dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. they got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. the art in this is probabley the best non-road runner art of the 1950's looney tunes shorts. it's hard to come across something better than the art in "the great piggy bank robbery", although nothing ever will. this probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd. shorts like this one might have spawned witless lt rip-offs like tiny toons adventures to try to squeeze out all the old comedy out over and over again, like how great movies like scream spawned crap like i know... which was released just to squeeze out all the old horror from scream, but like scream, this is great alone. chuck jones has had his faults with shorts once in a while but he does make up for them. take hopper for example. few people like hopper but it never ruined the lt reputation, but i'm sure this was his make up on things as such. bottom line: this is not as good as "duck! rabbit! duck!", but close. catch it on cartoon network frequently.

this is the middle cartoon of the three (between rabbit fire and duck! rabbit, duck!) and is the weakest of the three, while still being quite funny. it simply depends on one gag for too much of the action. still a good cartoon. i feel a definite sympathy for daffy in this one, which is rare for me. daffy is so clearly overmatched that it almost becomes painful to watch at times. good cartoon in an excellent series. recommended.

this is the second and best in the hunting trilogy! what makes it the best is the clever dialogue!bugs: do you want to shoot me now or wait till you get home?it was kind of funny how they kept that going through out the short!

in one of the many bugs bunny-daffy duck cartoons, elmer fudd is out hunting, and daffy tries to get him to shoot bugs. needless to say, bugs has his own agenda. moreover, "rabbit seasoning" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).i think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by bugs and daffy. one of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. all in all, this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.

rabbit seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature bugs bunny/daffy duck/elmer fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. love bugs and daffy stirring up "pronoun trouble" with daffy always the victim of elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets elmer in his love struck mode. chuck jones and michael maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons i've laughed at since i was a kid. and at least two of them end with daffy's exclamation to bugs: "you're despicable!" can't get better that that!

this film has its detractors, and courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. finney, naturally, is larger than life. courtney makes an ideal foil. i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. the period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial. i only wish it were out on dvd already...(*sigh*)...

see no evil with kane. the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn't a hide my eye's, scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe superstars on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters. i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out.great movie excellent would like to see a part 2 it doesn't matter if kane gets killed at the endor not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie they have out and they still comeback for more so a part 2 wouldbe very interesting.

kane is a killer named jacob goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. most of them die except for 3 of them. in my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. i still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. the best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the blonde girl's mouth. kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change. that was his only look the entire movie. great action and killing scenes, i don't think i could give it a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.

there's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing god's work. yeah right! this killer makes jason voorhes look like a chump, and freddy krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. he is jacob goodnight(wwe's glen "kane" jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a axe, and a hook and chain. those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. that is totally methodical! when the encounter happened 4 years earlier, jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. how on earth did goodnight survive after 4 years? now he's in the condemned hotel called blackwell. and this hotel got a lot of stories to tell. i thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting. i liked the part where goodnight checked out one of the girl's tattoo on her back. and goodnight himself is really deranged thanks to his maniacal mother. if you think friday the 13th was something, you better think again. this movie will leave you on the edge of you seat. and i think the eyeball rip was bone-chilling. this movie proves it point,and it wasn't a waste of my time. i enjoyed it. the title don't lie! rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!

finally a true horror movie. this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes. i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory. i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. i have to admit that i didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad i did. during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder. i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough. i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews. it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw ( first one), michael myers, and jason. and no cgi crap.

this horror movie is definitely one of the best ones i have seen in my life and there are many reasons why. the storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it the actors are not very good but there are not that bad but kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also the cast is very good such as kane as jacob goodnight, christina vidal as christine, michael j. pagan as tye, samantha noble as kira etc. also i just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but that just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore also they look very realistic. so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie. so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great.overall score: ********** out of ********** ***** out of *****

see no evil is the first film from wwe films. yes wwe, word wrestling entertainment, pro wrestling. of course being that it's a wwe film a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler being glenn jacobs aka kane. which is not really important as if you didn't know kane or what wwe stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. see no evil is gross out horror film, it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying, hey look how gross we can get! not that there is anything wrong with that. jacob goodnight (played by kane) is sort of a jason type character, his mother tortured him as a kid with strict (understatement) christian beliefs and has warped his mind. now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) and a handful of adults. i could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh, who cares? despite it's lack of originality see no evil is well made, for what it's supposed to be. kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. one flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive, i really looking forward to having them being horribly killed, but alas, does not happen. i wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although like i said the film has nothing to with wrestling, people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because, given of course if they are a wrestling hater. then again the movie may also make money because wrestling fans will want to see it. either way, see no evil has top notch effects and little cgi, and like i said, it's quite brutal so like i say it's good stuff....if you like that sort of thing.

well, i'm a few days late but what the hell....! anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to "see no evil" was....surprise. the film is actually pretty good. there is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. it hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. think "madman" meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick. while sne is thin on plot (most horror films are), it kind of makes up for it in the violence/methods of killing, the gore, suspense & the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight. the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers & stores them in big jars. why?? you'll just have to watch it & see (pun intended). there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho, tcm, & madman but they're not blatant. finally, sne really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before & granted, sne is no "pyscho" or "tcm 74" but it certainly merits a look imo. bloodstone's recommendation: take in a matinée showing of "see no evil" bloodstone's rating: 7.5/10

a dangerous psychopathic killer jacob goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting blackwell hotel,alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded jacob four years ago.when one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain,the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives..."see no evil" was directed by the porno filmmaker gregory dark and it stars wwe superstar kane as remorseless psychopath.the supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here,but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.overall,i liked this film and you should too,if you are into mindless slasher flicks.sure,it's cliché,but who cares.7 out of 10.

so the wwe has done it. they have poured over into film;their first one being see no evil, starring their very own kane. i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film...it just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new. to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad. a viewer stated above that it is good b-horror movie fun, and honestly thats the best way to describe it. now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up...well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the 'jacob goodnight' character. he sold the role really well, and really did look menacing. but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle. the acting was decent, and the story was nothing new of course, but we all know that. the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done. considering this was directed by a porn movie director, i was quite surprised. i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun. think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film. and save room for the ending too, cuz it's a good one. and stick around after the credits too...

i was expecting this movie to suck, but what i got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. the teens are decent, with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch. rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. i saw the "twist" coming from miles away, but i still enjoyed the movie.but what really stood out to me was the direction. gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him. aside from overusing the horror film "speed cam"(you know, where like the guy's face shakes all fast?), there's some good shots here. the camera angles and environments really emphasize kane's size, making him look even bigger than he actually is.if you're looking for deep story or characters, this ain't it. but that's not what slasher films are about. if you're looking for some good violence, or if you're into gory films, go check this out!

this, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern b-movie. the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2d for most of it. and yet there is a certain...charm. wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so i'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "not much of a reach for him," but glen jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. in any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top (jason would be proud), but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is quite the gorefest. the r-rating is richly deserved and i actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. in any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie.

the problem with other actors cast in the rôle of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part (hurd hatfield, helmut berger, josh duhamel, david gallagher, ben barnes) or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted. dorian is the perpetual 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and honey'd locks, as described by wilde, so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part (i.e., who can portray the naivité, callousness, and manipulativeness), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens. and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation.gielgud as henry wotton, while considerably older than what wilde had in mind, does wonders with his scenes--wilde's aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced. especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison (and his costume didn't fit).finally, jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a fitting interpretation. in general, the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gay--he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him more narcist than homosexual. he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel.of course the budget of this production was not very large, so everything feels a little stagey. particularly dorian's encounter with sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. also, the final shot of dorian (a puppet i suppose) in his white toad-like make-up is more hilarious than convincing and basil's death scene is inadvertently funny. (also, as far as i recall, basil should have been killed seated at the table.)but all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. i'm sure wilde would have liked it. the only thing missing is the sensual side. not so much sex scenes, but wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious cloths, and precious gems isn't really explored here, i.e. the aestheticism is completely missing. but like "i, claudius", the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.

playwright john osborne's (look back in anger, the entertainer) dramatisation of oscar wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much so. nonetheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast headed by sir john gielgud & jeremy brett, and the brilliantly cerebral production (marred only by a "too quick" ending) make this worth the while of any lover of theater, with a capital "t".

i will always think of mr. firth as dorian gray, if i live to be 100.perfectly acted and directed, bringing oscar wilde's insight, wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television.more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money.a must have for all wilde fans-and indeed for everyone else. inspired and perfected, every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done.by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. watch it, then try to watch another version. it's just not the same, is it?

i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it. i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his "death" acting was a little over the top, but as its jeremy brett i didn't mind.this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar wildes novel very closely. if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch "an ideal husband" with jeremy brett as lord goring.this film gives a great insight into oscar wildes way of thinking.and while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way dorian grey is lord alfred 'bosie' douglas and basil halward is oscar wilde.

in dramatising wilde's novel, john osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown dorian's essential wickedness. if you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson's "dr. jekyll and mr. hyde", but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas rls took the scientific route. both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.the actors in this bbc movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders, in his role really projecting wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. you'll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying, but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. peter firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display.it's a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.

onstage john osborne's adaptation of "picture of dorian gray" is a fine tribute to oscar wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed.)the acting however is brilliant. sir john gielgud return's to his wilde roots as lord henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. jeremy brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil hallward.peter firth,while not originally my vision of dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. the supporting cast is equally fine, gielgud's former 'importance of being earnest" co-star gwen francon-davies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi bowker makes a touching sybil vane. the wit,pathos and tension of wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. my only other qualm is with the hair styles. many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.

this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. lee, lifeson, and peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. that being said, i think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. this is not the fault of the boys however. they even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. they just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption. neil's snare sounds distant and geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but no bottom end at all!! they should have held out on this concert and waited for a better occasion. only buy this dvd if you are a hardcore rushian. the quality is lacking in the audio department.

admittedly alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio, ever. i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fan.i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig (logistics) and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere. the dvd is a small consolation - the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setup.naive perhaps, but i still don't understand the significance of the tumble-driers on-stage; i would be grateful for any clarification.cheers, iain.

after searching for 6 months, i finally found this dvd. all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait! "rush in rio" may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence. i'm not joking. it's incredible! all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. i find it makes you feel like you're actually in rio watching the concert from the audience. that's one of the reasons i love this dvd. it makes you feel like you're actually there. also, geddy, alex and neil have never been in better form! geddy's vocals are flawless, alex's guitar playing is still incredible, and neil - absolutely no words to say. the camera work on this concert was very good i must say. they gave us a good look at everything that was going on on-stage, and in the audience. kudos to the cameramen! anyways, enough of my raving! go watch "rush in rio" for yourself. you will be amazed. i guarantee it.10/10

these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. the musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists. future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. get this dvd and you will enjoy it throughly!! i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in houston, tx and was blown away. i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever. everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicianship is! there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime. lets just hope and pray that they do not retire anytime soon!

rush in rio is simply an amazing dvd. this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever.i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert, and not only that, i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage!! it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me. i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life.some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you listen is real, true to how it was in the concert. it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re-live that beautiful moment. many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking, so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was. sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing. this is not the case with rush in rio, this is the real deal!! i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's, i love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest. you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. this is a real live concert dvd.i highly recommend rush in rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances by geddy, alex and neil are mind-blowing. not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune, even yyz which is an instrumental!! i actually appear singing twice; in tom sawyer i sing "always hopeful yet discontent" and in earthshine i sing "only reflect". it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd!! awesome!! i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth.

i purchased this dvd recently and i was totally awed that rush's songs sound the same as they did when i first listened to them in 1980. the lineup of geddy lee, alex lifeson and neil peart is so talented that i want to listed to them play again and again.songs i remember like tom sawyer, xyz, the big money, the trees, freewill, closer to the heart, 2112, limelight, and the spirit of radio were played and the 40000 plus fans there singing along and having a great time and i swear over half the audience was under 25!writers who put down rush as far as rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco.rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync,wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried. all they do is entertain!i give this dvd a 100 out of 100.

having seen rush live, i'm able to appreciate the awesomeness of this. others may complain of sound problems, but it's sometimes over dubbed by the overwhelming screams of 60,000 brazilians and it goes to show the band's territorial gain of attention

"rush in rio" is, no doubt, one of the most exciting dvds i have purchased. although i am a biased rush fan of almost 20 years, i found this performance to be flawless. the music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile... it's like they were able to capture every concert i've been to. for any rush fan, this dvd is a must; if anything, just to see the "boys in brazil" documentary (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). for any non-rush fan, this dvd is an enjoyable concert. rush fans know the talent of these three canadians. we have rather firmly stood by them for years. i've shown this dvd (or portions of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of rush, or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (i.e., sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). the bottom line is this dvd is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it.

i have been a "huge" rush fan ever since "moving pictures" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular. they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. a real example of this is during "yyz" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful "lust" that rarely happens anymore. you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given. the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life. this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection. their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music. this dvd is worth it!

a long overdue concert release, rush-in-rio dvd is both compelling and disappointing. this slick two-disc set shows rush at their finest. after 30 years of honing their unique sound, it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever.the concert features over two dozen songs, a documentary, and three songs that feature multi-angle viewing. packaged in a bi-fold holder with sleeve and a small insert, it's priced very well for the amount of material it contains.i'm a rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period, and this dvd comes through big, with half of the show highlighting songs from that era. i won't list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. if you attended the vapor trails tour, then you'll know what they'll be playing.playing in rio to their biggest crowd ever, rush is a huge crowd pleaser here. in fact, that was one of the first things i noticed that was peculiar about this show. throughout most of this two hour concert, you hear and see the crowd, actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music. at first, it's heartening to see the fans give rush a well deserved response. but after several songs, i was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd. this is in no way a slam of the crowd of rio. more power to them! it's a critique of the final editing of the dvd.which brings me to my second and main reason "i hate it". the video editing is terrible in my opinion. save for the multi-angle view bonus cuts, the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos. it's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it. i count changing camera angles, on average, between every one and four seconds, constantly! after about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. which is too bad, because i would have liked to have sat through the whole show, like i was able to at the concert last year. maybe this fast-cut editing is the latest craze for concert dvd's, but i really think it's an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience. as stated before, i wouldn't mind it for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is hurried, or rushed. it's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips i've seen of rush, mainly from moving pictures, are strictly straight-filmed, with little switching back and forth. it's almost boring, visually speaking. this dvd has taken it to the other extreme. i know a lot of dyed-in-the-wool rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression of it.the bottom line: if you're a rush fan, you'll buy this dvd regardless of my review, or any other. i still would have bought it after i had read my review. just don't get expect a "normal" concert. who knows, the things mentioned above might not bother you.

this much anticipated dvd memento of rush's visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc.the picture and sound production values are amazing,even more so as they constantly battled the elements to bring this production off. all the tracks you would expect from the rush catalogue are here from tom sawyer to the pass gloriously reproduced for the frankly,orgiastic brazilian crowd.they actually singalong to yyz-which is an instrumental, and gives you an indication of their fervour!the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set-pieces -la villa strangiato,yyz and the awesome drum solo, plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil. all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.

this dvd will be treated with indifference by mllions of classic rock music devotees across the world because rush just aren't cool. it is a shame that rush have had to overcome sneering disdain from the majority of north american and british music journalists over their thirty odd year history as this has deprived many people the chance to get into a real band.each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalogue of songs it is! we have the seminal "2112", the magical "the trees" and the lyrical "tom sawyer" interspersed with the high-energy, genre-challenging pieces from their latest album "vapor trails." the musicianship is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and the brazilian fans are just plain crazy (at one point they sing along to an instrumental!)each band member plays at a level that defies belief-real craftsmen performing art.if you doubt this try out the instrumentals "la villa strangiato" or "the rhythm method" for size-and yes the latter is a drum solo (which has to be seen to be believed.)sound and vision production values are very high as befits the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angled set pieces to boot.this is an astonishing performance and tribute to the canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.

two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. the comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. it really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the aussie humor. they portray it very well and very realistically. of course, they're helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writer/director gregor jordan. i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it, and he heavily criticised it, basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone. i think that that's just rubbish. this film isn't trying to be pulp fiction, the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite. without wanting to sound superior or arrogant, i think to fully understand this film; the humor, the sincerity, the characters, etc....you have to be australian, or at least understand the culture, which the other guy obviously didn't have the faintest clue about. some americans, whose reviews of certain non-american films, seem ignorant to (and have trouble comprehending) anything that isn't an american product. it's a real shame, because this is a really great film. the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real, sincere and sweet way. i'm very proud to have this film in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.

having seen, and loved this film in australia, i was very keen to get me paws on a copy. i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it's a very different edit.the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier. the uk ,and i presume european, edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy's dead brother.and in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit.it is not a serious criticism, but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assured.i can't say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market?so careful about which one you go for.i went for both.

mild spoilers....and that's 'top ten of all time.' i stumbled across 'two hands' by accident (maybe that made it all the more special -- no inflated expectations) on ifc one night, and couldn't believe that i hadn't heard anything about it. now that heath ledger is getting more famous in the usa, i'm sure it's more available. at the time, i was telling friends about the film, and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional ifc showing.anyway, in the black-comedy/gangster genre it fits in well with my other favorites, and everybody in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve. bryan brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his small son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. also hilarious is the quick-edit fate of a random car thief. even heath was pretty good in it. at the time, i vaguely remembered him from a short-lived series on fox called 'roar.' hopefully gregor jordan will make another hit, but as far as i'm concerned, this is his best yet.

so i turned on the tv today at 1:00 pm on a sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately. the movie was excellent.there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one i don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it wasn't his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck, second i don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing panda's money, and then the other thief kills panda at the end, so they steal his money twice, and kill him how is that good?

this deceptively laid-back, low-key, casually paced aussie crime thriller unravels with a casual ease and relaxed self-confidence that's a delight to behold. eager beaver working class kid jimmy (an appealingly feckless heath ledger) yearns to make something out of his unrewarding ordinary life. jimmy gets his big break when local crime kingpin pando (an outstanding bryan brown) assigns him an easy courier gig which entails delivering $10 grand to an old lady. jimmy finds himself knee deep in serious trouble when he loses pando's money. writer/director gregor jordan's engagingly simple tale of how things aren't always what they're cracked up to be, young love, all actions having consequences and that hoary old chestnut about how crime doesn't pay works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well-observed minor quirky details, a strong subtext concerning man's duel capacity for both good and evil, a nice sense of unforced irony, the chillingly matter-of-fact way the violence is presented, and the marvelous grounding of the assorted complexly drawn warts'n'all low-life characters in an instantly recognizable and totally believable banal day-to-day reality (e.g., panda is shown playing scrabble with a flunky and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a fellow hood to talk with his son over the phone). judging from his finely shaded and two-fisted portrayal of the cunning, not to be trifled with pando, bryan brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to ever grace celluloid. a sturdy and satisfying little sleeper.

"two hands" is a hilarious australian gangster movie set in really sultry sydney. i bet tourists never envisage sydney and bondi to look like it did in this film: all sweaty bodies, oppressive nighttime and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. heath ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local king's cross boss's gang. he looked rather magnificent in his green wife beater and blue patterned budgie smuggler. a sweaty tattooed bod does become him. i always had him down as a "home & away" boy, and he has been in that soap, which is a little sweatier than the weetbix-insipid "neighbours". the film is really worth watching for its combination of sardonic humour and nasty violence - the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon. totty awards: country girl love interest city brother and tattooed streetkid.

i had never heard of this movie, but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting, so i figured i'd give it a shot. i found it to be very enjoyable. heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown. i won't go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown. from their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne, who plays ledger's love interest. i would definitely recommend this movie.

many years ago i saw this movie (on television maybe?) and loved it. so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation. it did. set in sydney's notorious king's cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex stores thrive), it tells the story of "jimmy" (played by heath ledger). jimmy is a young man...maybe late teens or thereabouts, who hasn't had a stable family background. he is on the fringes of society, and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). he is aware of an underworld figure called "pando", who is a local bigwig in the cross. it's jimmy's hope that he will find himself on pando's radar and get 'in' with him...a short-cut to upward social mobility, he hopes.one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex (played by the charming rose byrne). you just know that a love story will play out between them. on that night as well, jimmy is first contacted by pando (played by bryan brown). pando has a 'job' for jimmy. it's the 'foot in the door' that jimmy has been waiting for!to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer. stylistically, if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies, you should be in tune with what to expect...twists and turns and black comedy.what's so great about this movie is its very 'australian-ness'. it's no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie, but a genuine australian contribution to the genre. a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together. sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they're doing there. in the end, all these 'loose ends' tie together beautifully. it's sort of like a celluloid moebius strip.a highlight of the movie is bryan brown's character of pando. pando likes puzzles, and it's fun to see him play games with his cronies. it's the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable...his taste in music, for starters!of the heath ledger movies i have seen (the dark knight, 10 things i hate about you), this is perhaps his best role. wasn't taken with "10 things". if you are a heath ledger fan (ledger recently died a tragic, accidental death), this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role, i think. there is great chemistry between ledger and byrne in this movie-so, on one level, it functions as nice love story.this movie doesn't have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies, but it does have some adult themes...scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. in that sense, it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers, but it's not a movie that gore-hounds will get excited about either. lastly, i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this. usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting. this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknesses...i.e. it has a great story, great acting and a great script. we need more popular, quality movies like this to be made here in australia. highly recommended. other australian movies i have loved include:breaker morant (10/10) mad max 2 (10/10) my brilliant career (not reviewed here by me yet) proof (nr) the devil's playground (nr) the year my voice broke (nr) bad boy bubby (nr. a great, dark comedy) the dish (nr. a great, charming comedy)

"two hands" is an entertaining, funny story about australian lowlifes. the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.the clueless jimmy, portrayed with acumen by heath ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity. the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses. the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau.the film is well-directed and well-acted. the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film.

this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in kings cross, sydney. the plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown. the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. the setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. eg. when one crim is searching for bullets for his gun. i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies, and in this regard, the movie did not offend. it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown. the rest of the cast did an ok job, without any real stand-outs that i remember. the direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment. the main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake. the director, gregor jordan, deserves special mention. rating in my book - 7 (of 10).

if you enjoyed films like pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, and lock, stock, and two smoking barrels, you are going to love two hands. it has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained through the whole film. like pulp fiction, it has the wacky scenarios that the characters get into and how they deal with them. along with gallipoli and picnic at hanging rock, this has to be one of the best australian films i've seen. it also stars a young heath ledger before he got real big in the states.this is a terribly underrated movie that i believe is just as good as pulp fiction and those greats. you have to see it!

based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot summaries, i didn't expect much from 'two hands'. but how wrong i was. from start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. if you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch. i'm hoping heath ledger's tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film. he was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one not to be missed. don't make the mistake of judging and discarding this amazing film before you've seen it.

it's hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. that being said, two hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring. the absurdity of the goings-on, the thick australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also. the plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin. he doesn't; the job only lands him in trouble when he fancies a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach, which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree. however, all is not rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences...the film is made up of a cast of unknowns; at least, it was back in 1999, as nowadays heath ledger is something of a name. he doesn't impress too much here, however, as his performance is mostly of the one-note variety and he doesn't make for a very compelling lead. he fits the movie in that he's australian and looks naive; but beyond that, he's not the best lead i've ever seen in a movie. if you ask me, bryan brown gave the best performance here. he might not have a great deal of screen time, but he steals every scene he's in and it's him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour. he's got nothing to do with the best sequence, however, which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film. on the whole, i can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films; as the weirdness is plentiful, and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable; but if you're not a fan of this sort of film, i can't really say that two hands will float your boat. it's not a must see, but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it...you probably wont completely regret it.

a refreshing black comedy starring some of australia's finest. in the same way that lock stock and 2 smoking barrels captured the funny side of london gangsters, two hands rips through the sydney underworld. it wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone.an australian classic. if australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on.

jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of sydney, australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old jimmy, (heath ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. the gangsters, (led by bryan brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. that's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. but this mob tickle your funny bone as well. a clever structured script by jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.

`5 years ago if you were to watch an australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.luckily australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as blackrock, moulin rouge, chopper, yolngu boy and sample people.in this evolution of film we also find two hands.set in sydney's kings cross, two hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town. pando, played by bryan brown, is a sydney mob boss. he's the king of organised crime wearing thongs, carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami. he's vicious, but real. as are his mob', holding gun's to someone's head in one scene and then playing boardgames in the next. they are well respected and if they ask you for a favour, you don't say no.enter jimmy, played by heath ledger. jimmy is your average aussie guy in his early twenties. he's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone's bad side, so when pando asks jimmy to deliver $10,000, jimmy accepts.things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while jimmy is at the beach. so now jimmy is $10,000 in dept to a major mob boss. from here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with jimmy and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money, jimmy and alex (the love interest, played by rose byrne), pando trying to find jimmy and, of course, the two teenagers and their new found prosperity. the concept is deepened by the narrator, jimmy's dead brother, michael, who was killed by pando and his gang years earlier.in the end all the storylines connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and stun the audience. i thoroughly enjoyed it.

the inspiration for this film was the fact that american gangsters are well dresses, but the aussies, well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter, then you can dress as badly as you want and people won't criticize you.jimmy is fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes bouncer and is offered work by pando, the local gangster boss in the cross (that is, australia's notorious kings cross district, not the cross of london fame as many a british backpacker finds out the hard way).due to feelings of love he stuffs up a job, loses a lot of money and has to get it to pando before pando and his heavies can kill him.lots of dark humour, interesting action, revelations about the australia's underside and human nature. it is very centred in the australian nature and explores the nature of australian criminals (versus the american and british ones).one problem is that each of the elements of the story don't have enough substance and depth, but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously, so as an overall package it is worthwhile.team it up with "chopper" and "dirty deeds" for your aussie crime fest or "lock stock and two smoking barrels" and "miller's crossing" for an international falling short of the criminal gangs fest.by the way, bryan brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies. here is one of his great movies.

jimmy (heath ledger) is given a simple job by pando (bryan brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. jimmy rings pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. pando and his boys try their best to locate jimmy, meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him. so now jimmy goes into hiding to organise a bank robbery to get pando's money back. also throughout this mess he meets the innocently sweet alex (rose byrne) and together they're in for one hell of a ride through sydney's king cross."two hands" is simply an engrossing pick-me-up film that's brisk, exhilarating and incredibly fresh. what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in-your-face violence what, how's that fresh you ask? well, because it takes us into the underworld where the australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs (flip flops) and footy shorts, done up cars and a can of beer in the hand and don't forgot the australian sense of humour, dry and sarcastic. you can say it owes a lot to the likes of "pulp fiction", "goodfellas" (a fave of mine) and "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" for its inspiration, but for me it still stands on its own. the film has real mixture of light-hearted moments, but also a mean streak to it with some unexpected shocks and black humour that can actually be disturbing. you just don't know what's coming and it has a nice touch of snappy irony (especially the ending) and great timing with its humour. one scene involving a bank robbery will have you in stitches, i guarantee you. the plot's outline is really a coming to age story (or about the road not taken), with a punching love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it off. most of the sub-plots were cleverly constructed and interlocked, well maybe it could've gone without the supernatural element involving jimmy's dead brother, but in the overall context the diverse plot seems to all click together. intense, natural and crisp dialogue filled the outrageously colourful script, with quick jabs of aussie slang/twang - i'm fair dinkum! what truly made the film was that of bryan brown's performance of pando. he just gave his character such a deviously charismatic/nasty persona that when he wasn't on screen his presence was still felt. he gave his character two sides - one being a prick, but the other side is such a good bloke. a young rose byrne glows with her nervously sweet/quirky character alex. she looked radially gorgeous and added a bubbly personality. then you got heath ledger who fit's the buck as the naive jimmy. great supporting cast involved with the likes of susie porter, tom long, david field, steve vidler and steve le marquand. such raw performances are achieved and from that you get riveting, fun and believable characters. pumping rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with the likes of powderfinger and alex lloyd provide a cool vibe. also being shot on location in sydney's king cross really helped it stick out by holding a life of its own and showing the australian way of life. gliding camera tricks captured the city's backdrop superbly, especially the piercing nightlife. this was a film that when it ended i was totally satisfied with what i got. overall, a slickly paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do... a fun, clever and crazy roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement.i say, it's a successful aussie take on "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" by director/writer gregor jordan in his debut film. if you come across it, don't hesitate to it give it a go.

"two hands" is a good addition to the australian film catalogue.it is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the australians have developed on their own.heath ledger is basically a good if naive guy. wanting to get on he falls in with a local "big" man pando (bryan brown). but at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets alex (rose byrne). here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected. after getting on the wrong side of pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film. yes, jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it. although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.heath ledger is excellent as jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, rose is hypnotic as alex and bryan is marvellous as usual. this is a small ensemble of characters are believable and i found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.this dvd is usually in the cheap aisle so i would recommend adding it too your dvd collection, it would be money well spent.8 out of 10

i remember catching this film on a c4 screening a year ago and i was completely blown away by the whole thing. i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime, and so many more.i was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters. it made me feel terrified at one second for jimmy, and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next... and all the time i had my fingers crossed that things would work out for jimbo!heath ledger and rose bryne are superb, bryan brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up, along with david field, who was funny as well as being an evil git.since i saw this film i managed to order it on dvd and as a result, every person i show it to has been hooked in much the same way.this film is perfect for a sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around.

spoiler--in 1993, african-american director/actor mario van peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film new jack city with "posse". the film was co-written and directed by van peebles, who also stars as the main character, jessie lee.plot: the film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the united states was embroiled in the spanish-american war. apparently a time when the u.s. justice system could send convicts into military service, jessie lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in cuba. some of his compatriots include little j (stephen baldwin), fast-talking weezie (charles lane) and the towering-but-simple obobo (tiny lister). they find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it. however, the ambitious, bigoted colonel graham (zane) finds out about the gold, and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it. a shootout between the graham's forces and jessie lee's leaves the colonel blind in one eye, and his forces retreat. jessie lee's ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves (and the gold) back to new orleans, but it turns out that graham isn't far behind. jessie lee and his allies are forced to go on the run, heading west, to a town called freemanville. apparently, freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the civil war. jessie lee's father, "king david", was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town. however, as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks, king david was soon brutally murdered by a white mob, in a parallel of the ku klux klan terror campaigns that began around the same time. jessie lee and company eventually find their way to freemanville, only to find that the townsfolk aren't exactly glad to see himespecially when sheriff bates (richard jordan) of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants jessie lee and his partnersdead or alive. carver (blair underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of freemanvilleand his own agenda may not square with having jessie lee around.analysis the action sequences are all very credible, and mario van peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero. in the aftermath of the success of new jack city, it was almost expected van peebles would helm a sequel, or at least a similar urban-action follow-up. instead, van peebles looked 100 years into the past, creating a mostly-black western (effectively 'updating' the black-themed westerns of the 1970's), and continuing the legacy of largely-forgotten black-themed cowboy films from the early 20th century. unlike new jack city, the film was independently financed, and originally released through gramercy/polygram entertainment. allegedly, execs at the major studios balked when van peebles pitched 'posse' to them. some of the more "curious" casting at the time involved rappers big daddy kane and tone loc as father time and angel, respectively. in certain interviews, mario van peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type; in the years since, the trend of casting rap singers in non-musical films would become almost commonplace. keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities: black-action film veterans like isaac hayes ("truck turner"), pam grier ("foxy brown") and larry cook ("the spook who sat by the door") show up, as does stand-up legend nipsey russell, not to mention tv producer stephen j. cannell (who hired the junior van peebles to star in "sonny spoon" years earlier). the film is bookended with woody strode ("spartacus") in a key role.

i enjoyed this movie extremely. it was the last great mario van peebles movie i know of. it had a hip-hop old west flavor to it. big daddy kane and tone loc had major parts. it shouldn't have won any oscars, but it was enjoyable all the same.

ok, maybe posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. but that's because it didn't have the funding those movies had. obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on african american historical involvement (and no, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. and believe me they weren't. the producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make "posse", just so that the story could be told. i think that alone is commendable. posse may not be oscar material (and they don't like black media too much either), but it is a start. it is entertaining, and it introduces us to the black cowboy, a character most of us are unfamiliar with.

i'm not the biggest fan of westerns. my two personal favorites though are unforgiven, and tombstone. this movie though, i loved! it was great! the plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! i even think it beat out both movies in someway. well, not really unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. i do think it beat out tombstone though. both had its strong points. for instance, they both had excellent well known casts, very good plots, and very good filming. but posse beat out tombstone in four ways in my opinion. first, the characters were more unique in posse. the music was better in posse. the idea was original in posse, unlike wyatt earp. and the biggest difference, the action sequences! oh my gosh! posse was a western with really good action sequences. i mean really good! the action was fast paced. like modern day based shoot'em up movies. the action had big budget explosions too! the fistfights were pretty good also. mario van pebbles was great in this movie! i suggest buying this excellent movie!

a good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. lead by mario van peebles, who does ok, the gang of misfits on the run from billy zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. there're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even stephen baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.

thank you mario van peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.the plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. it was great that you used so many african-american artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. it was also good to see billy zane in this movie. does he ever play a good guy?i would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. this is an excellent movie and i feel privileged to have seen it. hopefully, you'll feel the same.

i think that mario van peebles movie posse is a very important film. it is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. this is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the spanish-american war with a cache of gold. the main character peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. the racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including melvin van peebles (marios father), billy zane, stephen baldwin and a wonderful performance by big daddy kane. one senses that peeples strived to use as many notable black (and some not so notable - smile) actors as possible : ) perhaps too many, some notable persons (issac hayes, pamela grier) are only scene in cameo, others briefly such as tone loc. the sentiment and efforts of peebles efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. the large cast (a feat for any director) work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic "revenge and fight vs justice" western.most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor woody strode (from once upon a time in the west), who's own life was a barrier-breaker, within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory. no other actor could have done this role better. read the mini-bio on woody strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio the film does a good job of balancing action with a bit of sardonic humour. the dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary! and as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period. the sex scene was a bit much -- not really needed. there are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic branding of the cattle etc. but posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works reflective of other untold stories and events. the actual photos of real cowboys at the end credits was very nice touch.

trey's favourite from the first run of season 10 and also one of my personal favourites, manbearpig features the adventure of al gore before going on global warming and before the movie, it was similar a adventure certainly, al gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig, al gore had only one thing in mind: to aware everyone of manbearpig and to kill it! al gore here is more than hilarious, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish, doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f****** demented bastard. basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of al gore but certainly he don't have that in his mind, there's not space for any other subject, is just manbearpig what concerns al gore. those four kids are cartman, kenny, kyle and stan, basically stan felt sorry for al gore and the four boys were just playing in al gore's game never imaging that gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill manbearpig (hilarious scene- "they are just children, damned manbearpig"). so at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for al gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave, certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick cartman in both senses, he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. and in the end al gore does killed manbearpig! this character is a fantastic one and i'm cereal! terrific fun in this episode, a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10

manbearpig is a pretty funny episode of south park.it spoofs al gore and his speeches on global warming, only replacing global warming with manbearpig(a fictional monster who has parts of a man, a bear and a pig).he tells the boys about it in a school assembly and stan feels sorry for him, so he and the boys decide to hang out with him.gore eventually gets them trapped in a rock cave where he believes manbearpig to be and they are stuck for days.meanwhile, cartman finds treasure but wants to keep it all to himself.manbearpig is a good spoof on global warming and overall a funny south park episode.8/10

alright so this episode makes fun of al gore. i'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. the thing is south park makes fun of everybody, much like the simpsons did. if you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. with that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. al gores portrayal is hilarious, cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing. it is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites. i'll won't comment too much further on the plot because i don't want to give anything away.

first of all, ignore the comment about how south park should make fun of republicans. everyone is doing that now, why should south park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? and what the republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than al gore and his global warming hysteria.but all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. al gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician i've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man. i don't want to give anything away, but it had me rolling on the floor.there are also has some of the best cartman/kyle moments ever.all in all i'd say that this is one of the best episodes the show has ever had, and i would highly recommend it to anybody.

this was a pretty good episode. though no "trapped in the closet" or "cartoon wars," it had a lot of things going for it. the character of al gore and that bizarre-as-hell "super cereal" thing was pretty darn funny. but, the scene that made me adore this episode was one i'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartman/kyle moments ever. when cartman is superstitious of kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake!), and he comes within inches of his face. suddenly, kyle wakes up, and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine. cartman crapping out the treasure at the end, though predictable, was pretty funny.

wesley eure is young inventor brian foster, who's invented a new crime busting security device in the form of a robot dog, the titular "c.h.o.m.p.s." (it stands for canine home protection system). c.h.o.m.p.s., who's been modeled after brian's real dog rascal, can do just about anything; he's got enhanced speed, strength, x-ray vision, and the like. it's just the thing to save his boss ralph norton's (conrad bain) security company. naturally, a slimy competitor, gibbs (jim backus) wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret.this is the kind of thing that's just too hard to resist. it's got plenty of slapstick (chuck mccann and red buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots), an upbeat attitude, an engaging cast, and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. the energetic disco-style music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is straightforward, and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. in one thoroughly odd but side-splitting touch, there's another dog in the film (named "monster") whose thoughts we actually get to hear; both his dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless. in fact, he even utilizes some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively gut busting final note.eure and the cute valerie bertinelli are very likable young leads, and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster. larry bishop, hermione baddeley, robert q. lewis, and regis toomey also co-star.a rare theatrical live-action venture for the cartoon-creating team of hanna & barbera ('the flintstones', 'scooby-doo', 'the smurfs', and so on), "c.h.o.m.p.s." is agreeably silly stuff. i know it left me with a smile on my face.7/10

this movie is a nice, cute family oriented film. if you don't like violence, this is the movie to watch. only thing annoying about this movie is the tune (but it's a catchy tune) repeats whenever c.h.o.m.p.s. leaps in to action.

eager electronics whiz brian foster (a likable performance by wesley eure of tv's "land of the lost") creates a computerized watchdog called c.h.o.m.p.s. (an acronym for canine home protection system) for his boss mr. ralph norton (nicely played by conrad baain), whose home security business is floundering. a rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on c.h.o.m.p.s.; said task proves to be easier said than done. director don chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. moreover, the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb: the adorable valerie bertinelli as brian's sweet fiancé casey norton, chuck mccann as klutzy crook brooks, red buttons as mccann's equally bumbling partner bracken, jim backus as evil ceo mr. gibbs, hermoine baddeley as nice old biddy ms. foster, and 60's aip exploitation feature regular larry bishop as smarmy, duplicitous suit ken sharp. best of all, the titular pooch is a cuddly delight: c.h.o.m.p.s. jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer, and even does a few nifty martial arts moves. a subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named monster supplies a few extra belly laughs (monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep, growly voice). the groovy animated opening credits sequence, charles f. wheeler's glossy cinematography, and hoyt curtin's funky, pulsating disco score are all solid as well. a cute little kiddie flick.

i saw chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. it is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. the simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. it is also thought provoking. with deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. movies have different genera's and different purposes. this movie, which is delightful to all ages, offers an interesting humorous look into our own experiences. everyone will recognize personality and behaviors types of themselves and others. everyone will see the humor. the humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. for lighthearted laughter and a 'feel good' movie chomps is an excellent choice. memorable.

hello all! i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew maniratnam would've given an excellent film! i was stunned!! the backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in sri lanka and the government. the story is about how an young girl amudha who lives with her foster parents at chennai, india leaves to sri lanka in search of her real mother. the high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. full marks to the cast and crew. i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there. excellent work! though the war sequences reminded me of saving private ryan, such a work was never attempted on indian screen. overall the movie is great! and hats off to mr.maniratnam.mani ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take indian cinema to great heights! i would love to watch this film again and again. an excellent film and a must see.

brian (wesley eure) works for a security firm owned by mr. norton (conrad bain). the norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (jim bacchus). it's not brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. but, mr. norton has no patience with brian, in part because norton's beautiful daughter, casey (valerie bertinelli) has a thing for brian and norton questions brian's motives for wooing her. however, brian does come up with a great security device. it's called chomps, which stands for canine home security system. the device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. the rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is red buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. will chomps save norton security? this is a fun family flick from the old school of good, clean entertainment. chomps is, of course, a real dog, played by the adorable and talented benji. in fact, benji has a duel role, as brian has a "real" dog named rascal, too. just watching this little dog in action is pure joy, as he is able to scale walls, "pull" trucks, and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. the human cast is also quite nice, with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. costumes, scenery, and production values are good, too. although you may have trouble locating the film, it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. chomps is a wonderful, wholesome diversion from the world's woes.

the most enjoyable pet movie since scooby doo and garfield. the story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named brian foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, brian is also dating the boss's daughter named casey. but brian secretly invented a robotic dog named chomps, modeled after his own dog rascal. but chomps is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. the new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success. but when the company rivals hear about chomps, they try to find a way to capture him. can chomps outwit them before its too late. this movie is a classic for all ages.

this was on odd film. i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (spoiler ahead) ironically, the main character murders a federal official. then he's a fugitive on the run. they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.this was on odd film. i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children.

to tell you the truth, i do not speak tamil, and i did not understand the film. my good tamil friend, kaneswaran kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained every thing to me. what a great movie!!! after watching this movie, i felt i should have watched many more movies from tollywood (tamil film industry). the war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. the actress "simran", what a beauty. give her an award for best looking someone. ding, ding, ding, come on i smell a oscar winner. i didnt understand the songs, but they were excellent. mani ratnam is a great director, and i hope his next film was a success.

you don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.i don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.and the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).the story is really touching and hats off to mr. ratnam for trying something different.the relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.(i could identify with the characters in the movie).it was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.also the songs are just out of this world!they were beautifully and meaningfully picturised.if only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics:(

i think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. there are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'kannathil mutthamittal' and 'velai pookal'. great songs, both of them. i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and superb songs! ). cheers simran.

when i stepped into the theater, i thought this was going to be a great movie. and i was not disappointed one bit. wow! this movie is brilliant! the emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! great acting by madhavan and simran. beautiful music by a.r. rahman. this might most probably be the best tamil movie i've seen in ages. mani ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.this movie is basically about a young girl (p.s. keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (nandita das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (j.d. chakravathy). a young novelist (madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. he and his wife (simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother.this movie really screams excellent. the way mani ratnam presented the movie is magnificent. my rating - 10/10

this is an incredible movie that begins slowly. it leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama. then, in the second half, there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope.if you are unaccustomed to films from india, with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason, stick with this movie. especially beginning with the second half, you will find this movie an amazing experience.*********** minor spoiler here ************* i have but one complaint with the movie. the dialog at the end (between amudha and mds) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people's lives. it was implied all along, but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for mds.

one more classic performance by maniratnam and his team. they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an "all time classic". the war and its impacts in sri lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect. madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays, and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry. music by ar rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies. above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times.

the trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too, not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps, but because what actually transpires, will provoke entirely different lines of questioning, some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film, leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events. which of course means plenty of material for an after-show discussion.metaphorically, the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life, and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, seldom out of the box. there's a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even threading on existentialism, where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul, and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion.what i disliked about the film, is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the cia and nsa, as though there's something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of. they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny, that nobody can be trusted, wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative. having it set in 1976, against a nasa backdrop of manned space missions, and in langley, virginia, also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patiently.based upon the short story button, button written by richard matheson and made into an episode of the twilight zone, the story follows the lewis family, where husband arthur (james marsden) works at nasa and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife norma (cameron diaz), and you'd think it's all happy family with their son walter (sam oz stone), until one day a mysterious man called arlington steward (frank langella in a two-face inspired facial effect) whom we are preempted of in the opening, comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box. plunge the button and they'll get a million bucks (we're talking in dollar terms of the 70s here) although a stranger out there will die. if they don't, well the deal's got an expiry date.the story would dictate a deal be made, which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more shady characters (who nosebleed) appearing, some whom are inexplicably zombie like, apparently all under the influence, or employment, or arlington steward. whether or not steward is death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger from god or a representative of aliens after an anal probe, remains unanswered, so whichever way you look at it, it's as if he's delivering something expected, just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from.if you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative, the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look, as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print. it's full circle this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, manifesting its result in longer term pain, confusion and further choices that we'll make based on real sacrifices. nifty special effects come into play as well, though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film.so is it horror, science fiction, or a mystery thriller? it's everything rolled into one actually, together with a sprinkling of the philosophical. just don't go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end  this is like an x-files episode on steroids.

the box is one of the strangest movies i have ever seen. to explain my experience, let me use this word picture: imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but twilight zone reruns. the resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your iv. the dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.summary: a man shows up at the door of a couple. he gives them a box with a button on it. press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. i'll try not to spoil anything, but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. but hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and change is good.pros: amazing storyline, overall good acting, not a slow moment once it gets going. it asks questions of human morality that are rarely, if ever asked in popular culture. this movie is deep, it has meaning. its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. but i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much.cons: the first twenty minutes, before it gets going, are really quite slow. at the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. i can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics; it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds. in fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened). personally i don't think this is a bad thing, but many will.rating: easily a 9/10. i have never had an experience like watching this movie. the only reason i can't give it a 10/10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself. there are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as i sit here writing this. but overall, this is the best experience i have had in a movie theater in quite a long time. but be warned, you will not like this movie if you can't sit back, turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150%, and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.visit www.thestuffblag.com for more reviews

"when i die, someone will bury me. and if they don't, what's the difference. who gives a damn, huh?" thus the philosophy of life (or lack there of) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of sergio leone's "dollars trilogy."in the opening scene, three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and, with menacing glares, they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leone's for a few dollars more. there is one guy in eastwood's poncho, one in lee van cleef's black suit, and one seeming to act like gian marie volonte's indio. but this movie is not about these guys. no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger.no. this is an altogether different story.in an obvious copying of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly, three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure. once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit. the stranger (george hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest. he is after the reward for the bandit monetero (gilbert roland). but when monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.to round off the trio there is edd byrne's corrupt bank executive, clayton. he too wants the money for himself. but after the money is hidden away, the only man who knows where it is gets shot. now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does. and any gun can play.with plenty of gunfights, fist fights, and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff, a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good, the bad, and the ugly -- but with a twist.this movie is not as good as leone's films, of course, but in the end who gives a damn, huh? this movie is fun -- 60s nihilism, spaghetti western style. there are no rules, no enduring loyalties, and no right or wrong -- just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. and, though the movie is not classic, the ending surely is. hey, maybe we all can get along after all, for a hundred thousand a piece.if you like spaghetti westerns, check this one out. it is fast, furious, and worth the look.

hallelujah!!!! finally, a true colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how bogotá and colombia really are! i am an american of colombian and french heritage sick and tired of seeing colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by hollywood and others.how many of you are aware that colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the usa), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of ugly betty), that it's capital, bogota (pop. 9 million) is the "world capital of the book," or that this beautiful city is host to the world's largest international theatre festival? i hope that doug liman, simon kinberg (-mr. & mrs. smith), robert zemeckis, diane thomas (romancing the stone) one day visit bogotá, to see how wonderful it really is, and focus on bogotá's cultural vitality and diversity, instead of myopically producing films such as maria full of grace from which joshua marston profited greatly (for this terrific film) without ever thinking-through about the ontological damage his film would help to perpetuate upon the "unfairly tarnished image" of colombia.-anyway, you will at least enjoy bluff very much! -oh, and thanks imdb for your invaluable/great work!!!

this film is one to spend the short while, entertainment, but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything identifies "the colombian". who looks for the topics of the supposed colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is denominated "it jeopardize",it is better than it is not going to see this film. some to the drug traffic, or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker, or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political. the corrupt police is a personage who it could be mexican, russian, italian or chinese, and also the personage protagonist, an argentine photographer, it could be venezuelan, peruvian or philippine and the frequent "boludo" in its parliaments it could be replaced by another word of slang of any other country without the personage or history changes. the important thing is that it is a very decently counted history with images and right performances. its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones. that if one film like this if it deserves or does not deserve the support with publics bottoms a little is a classic discussion "mamerta".

'bluff' has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in bogota, and today i finally got round to seeing it. i didn't really know what to expect at all, but was very happily surprised. it is a crime comedy of the same ilk as snatch etc, and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy. the style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the argentinean narrator who makes asides direct to camera -- odd the first time, but subsequently fitting naturally.with my less-than-perfect spanish, i still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow, and plenty of the comedy is situational. my colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different regions and social classes which did pass me by somewhat, but for instance a well-acted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language.i think it is to this film's credit that it has something of a global flavour: i wasn't often reminded that this was colombia that i was watching. yet it is important to note that many wealthy bogotanos do live like some of the characters in this film, and it is not a mis-portrayal of bogota or colombian society in any way, just a *selective* portrayal -- as is any film supposedly portraying a 'real' situation/culture.i don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles, but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out: it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour. and all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes.

bluff i really think this movie is very good.is basic a different kind of colombian movie. is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.it shows a different face o bogotá and i think that's very important because colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director felipe martinez and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.we need to continue support colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.

i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. and amazingly i found it really original. i have commented on other colombian films before, and i agree that colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. but let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. unfortunately, this is how real people speak. the storyline and the pacing are brilliant, and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world the acting was great, and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in colombian soil. i think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy. it kind of reminded me of films like snatch, and others of the sort. i highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people, since colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.

on one level, hari om is a film using a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: curious westerner explores the mysterious east. but at its heart, the film is about two people, a young french beauty (isa) bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver (hari om) with bollywood aspirations, from vastly different cultures, their slowly growing attraction for each other, and the beautiful mad chaos that is india today. the gap between them can never be bridged, but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an affair as possible without damaging the story's plausibility. india and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative, and except for the main characters, the roles are played beautifully and persuasively by locals recruited during the film's production while on the road between the indian towns and villages that form the film's setting. one major negative for this viewer: a keystone kops chase near the film's conclusion as hari flees mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt. but the closing scenes where isa and hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable.

between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of indian locations and a plot which is bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. and by this, i mean "good", not a hollywood or bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. east meets west in a different take on the buddy film. the performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. hari om is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth. see it!

hari om is about an impossible love between a french tourist and the auto-rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a rendezvous with her indifferent boyfriend. a sort of third-world road movie, that careens from lush reverie to madcap comedy, it is distinguished by the stellar performance of vijay raaz, who has become one of india's busier actors after his appearance as the event planner in mira nair's monsoon wedding.in an interview, raaz proves to be quite untouched by his success, responding rather carefully and pensively to questions. he discovered a love of acting and joined a major theatre troupe while in university, but for one with so much formal training is surprisingly inarticulate about his craft. he speaks of honesty and purity as the wellsprings of his approach, and the earnestness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear. on screen, raaz conveys an emotional integrity and dramatic assurance that lifts his characterization to an extraordinary level, and director bharatbala has cast and directed him perfectly. he has a wonderfully expressive face which the camera revels in; close-ups of that face are as compelling as shots of camille natta, who is gorgeous as the frenchwoman isa.

in a word...magical. and so incredibly real. vijay raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his characters to succeed, in whatever he does. and he plays hari om impeccably- from his absolutely perfect "bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward, shy manner with a first kiss. he is a truly gifted actor and i wouldn't hesitate to see him in anything, because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul. camille natta is absolutely gorgeous. it took some time for me to warm up to her- possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist so well. her transition really became her and she molded into her role very well. even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend benoit, was wonderful, though you never really like him for the scum that he plays, jean-marie lamour enacts a perfect cad. the script- so real. i found myself turning to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say, "that's exactly what happens in india! they nailed it!" very real, very raw. very bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled. music by nitin sawhney is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing moods. but vijay raaz...i find myself constantly coming back to him- because he is what makes this movie. he is the hero, the most charming, disarming rickshaw driver you will ever encounter- he's magical. a lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor who i cannot wait to see shine and succeed in bollywood, hollywood or anywhere!

the opening night for the 'south asian international film festival' (saiff) in new york was an event a lot of us were waiting for.i would finally get to watch 'hari om'  i was tired of watching the "promo" on a loop and the lingering taste of the song angel by nitin sawhney in the promo, left me begging to hear the rest of it. i was impressed by the visuals and tremendously curious about how the rugged looking auto rickshaw driver would win the hearts of the stunning sophisticated looking french tourist! i remember being rather intrigued by the theme, when i'd read a line or two about it in the papers, ages ago! especially so, since i'd personally been very fascinated a few years ago, by how flamboyant the rickshaws in jodhpur were! the snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety rising.once inside the theater, i found that the saiff organizers only presented disaster. i was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult spot, trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends (of mixed nationalities) whom i'd invited on the vip guest list. i was hoping to prove to them that indian cinema was not always about bollywood eventually and finally, the movie began sending some fresh air our way. or so i thought hari om  started with chaos and noise. autorickshaws honking, traffic and a whole lot of chaos. i found myself smiling as i felt a sense of "home" filling up inside me.thus began the journey of hari om an auto rickshaw driver in jaipur  the director couldn't have made a better casting call with this character. from monsoon wedding to hari om  vijay raaz, despite his non-hero looks, carries this movie solely on his acting skills and his take on the character, replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in rajasthan. he's a winner all the way. but how and where he learnt to speak english even that fluently, is the question! however, his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. i love his innocent portrayal of a simple guy from a village who has big aspirations of being famous some day and yet knows when to cut away to reality.camille, on the other hand enters the movie wearing clothes that anyone wouldn't dare to wear in a place like that. it's funny however, that no one seems to really care too much about her dressed like that. she looks very very dazzling though! especially in the latter half of the movie, when she changes to indian attire. her relationship with her boyfriend however seems very vague. it probably adds to the touch of reality of certain kinds of relationships.the movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of rajasthan  the surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed anything other than what they really are. you see the dirt, you see the primitive houses you see rajasthan exactly the way it is!! yet  there's only one adjective that it leaves you with  'beautiful'.this is the first director who probably knows how to portray india exactly the way it is- with the dirt and the noise and all the negatives that india is attached to! yet making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be in.kudos! to him for that.the only downside of the movie that i could possibly see, is the pace i found it rather slow at certain parts  but rest assured that you will never be bored.nitin sawhney's background scores add a classy international, yet very indian flavor to the movie. the song "angel" which plays at a very crucial time in the movie, blends beautifully with the visuals.i've also heard that besides the main characters, all the other actors are actually just normal people who'd never ever faced a camera before!! that's commendable considering, most of our so called established actors  still can't portray realistic characters on screen.all in all, watching this movie was a beautiful experience  it is a pot pourri of emotions. it's got romance, humour realism beautiful visuals and locations... , great music, a great cast  a package deal! when i walked out of the theater - i felt proud to be indian a few days later, i asked one of my bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me, if he'd want to watch another indian movie  and his response was  " is it better than hari om? if it is, then i'll go if not, i think i'll pass. from now on, hari om will be the benchmark for every indian movie that i see." mr. bala, are you reading?

i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it. it's like taking a trip to india....colorful, magical, thought provoking. aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor. the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy. the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good. visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is like...dreamlike. sometimes it's hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real...the movie has that same quality. great soundtrack too!

was very fortunate to see the movie hari om at the bermuda international film festival. it was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. it was shot beautifully around india and i want to go there now. the main actor..vijay was absolutely incredible. he was the highlight of the movie. apparently he was also in the movie..monsoon wedding. he was the total star of the show. benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. and the girl (forget the name) was great too. they were all great! there were many tremendous scenes like the one with the monkeys. and basically i just loved the movie. everyone walking out was raving about it and it was certainly a high point of the film festival. was my favorite from the festival. it really beautifully captured the liveliness of india and can't believe how beautiful india is. the feeling upon walking out of the cinema..was a real high. it is a delightful, happy film. i loved it!!

"hari om" is an indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from monsoon wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern india. there's no "bend it like beckham" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real india permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors. fortunately for us, hari om's companion is a young and beautiful french woman in search of a journey. with overtures of an "y tu mama tambien" trip toward self-discovery (without the sex and fatal disease), this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophic mind. against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists, all identify with traits of both and the cultural divide disappears as humanity steps in. most succinctly put, the movie's central theme, "everyone has a love story, don't let yours pass by" teaches us a great deal about love on a number of levels. don't let this film pass you by!

i loved this film, which i have just seen at the philadelphia film festival. in march 2005 i went to india with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. i related to everything, and savored every moment. the characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. i also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. this movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (east and west). the supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in india quite realistically. the humor is subtle, and at times dry, and this makes it all the more realistic, as it is woven into the daily escapades of the characters. it is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed.

i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of it.i have e-mailed film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. i have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. the performances are superb. the film has everything. its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days. it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end. the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific. i also cannot hear the song badge by cream and not think of this film. this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb. channel four please show again or release on video or dvd.

what a surprise. a basic copycat of the comedy classic 'the nutty professor' only naughtier. funny guy tim thomerson (who steals the show as blinkin in robin hood-men in tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive dr. jekyll and the sex crazed hyde. the one scene that is really funny is when dr. lanyon (mark blankfield) catches jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: "how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter." jekyll replies, "but sir, i'm going ahead with the operation."lanyon replies back, "oh. well in that case fu** your brains out!!!"

the "all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..." scene was a riot. i also guffawed at the scene in the bar where hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the japanese guy and said "pearl harbor buddy". i think my iq is higher than 115, but i'm not sure because i can't count that high.funny thing, this 10 line requirement. seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. i hope i don't make it to 1,000 words before i get to line 10.i'm still two lines short. pardon me while i think and drink, or drink and think. it depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. good, i think i've made it to the 10 line limit. thanks for reading!

mark blankfield (from the old late night tv show "fridays")plays dr. daniel jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. this was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. this is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains. there's a few subplots like jekyll's fiancée, who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain, jekyll's employer. and there's tim thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes, and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants, including testicles. yeah, the humor is raunchy and silly, and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless, but if you're not above a quick wallow in the gutter, you'll probably like it just fine. now available on dvd too, for the first time! woohoo! 7 out of 10.

"pearl harbor, buddy." this movie is brilliant! sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. i'm one that goes for silliness, much like "dumb and dumber", "airplane" and "wet hot american summer" and i have to say this easily ranks up there. movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece! when watching this, you will easily find over 20 quotes from it that you will find yourself quoting after-wards... and after to watch it again you'll find even more!

in the first transformation scene, what is the music? i've heard it was "the greeks don't get no freeks". is that right? i really liked that sound. i also liked the "hyde's got nothing to hide" in the final scenes. truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. madam woo-woo's place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself. ivy venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. she looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit. mark blankfield reminds one of gene wilder in some ways. bess armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.

i love this movie a lot. i must get this on dvd. i have 2 vhs copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. i'm forever amazed that blankfield did almost nothing afterward. he made both dr. jeckle and mr. hyde totally believable.the movie is plagued by it's low budget. (one atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, "siskel & ebert".) but, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate. i often find myself quoting lines (or, singing, "i've got nothing to hide") and, from time to time, completely describe a scene which matches some conversation. there are, at least, six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits.viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags."here, take it." * visual of driving while waving butt out the window.* "i said, 'is this seat taken?'"

some said that this was a nose candy glorification flick, but short of the original dr. hyde's concoction, no drug has yet been developed that can provide this effect. if viagra was the slime mold stage, that white sparkling powder is the stephen hawking evolutionary rung (or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch). this reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as was the emperor without clothes. few of us want to question the health field; both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before "modern medicine", and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions. so the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those calcutta bessy's, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. the timing was right, and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of oz. a decade before, when george c. scott ranted through the movie the hospital, my wife and i were sitting in the packed premiere in oklahoma city. just as in jekyll & hyde's remake, we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat, and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration. the hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent. they were shocked that doctors, nurses, & the hospital institution were being mocked. it was as if the pope, billy graham, and gandhi were were sitting in the animal house, beer stained tee shirts and all, competing to see who could tell the funniest god knock-knock jokes between belches. had the hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they might have been able to see what was being shown to them. unfortunately they were like republicans at a screening of michael moore's 9/11. perhaps smaller golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders, health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care, and health providers would have been demystified earlier, if george c. scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths. but--forget everything i just said. watch the movie, be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever saturday night live skit, and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality. just don't blame me when "got to got to got to got to" becomes one of your sayings, or when "hyde's got nothing to hide" occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by "its a small world after all". or when you start calling your local hospital our lady of pain and suffering instead of our lady of eternal construction. even oklahomans were changing their favorite terrible boss wishbone winner entreaty from "piss on him and leave him for dead", to "body in a pit, you in it....." the smell of death...it's gone! chicken sushi! mary. mary. maryeeeeeeeeeeeee!

it took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on dvd (and my vcr is not worth hooking up again). i guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. but i found a decent bootleg on ebay and i must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. it is a slap stick spoof in the vein of "airplane." i must say that when i watched it on showtime or spotlight growing up in the 80s, i enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than i do now. but it's definitely worth watching just to see what they(i.e., movie makers) were able to get away with before the "just say no" hypocrites unleashed their propaganda. sing..."we are all on drugs" hahaha it's a silly film and worth the $10 i paid off of ebay to get it on dvd just don't even think about comparing it to the original - that's just plain stupid. what are you high?

coming from the "druggie" generation, i thought this movie was hilarious. it definitely brought jekyll & hyde up-to-date, so to speak. my husband and i laughed all the way through it. would love to have the movie in my collection. i told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. they aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. it's been so long since i've seen it i can't remember but a few things. i would have to say the funniest part was when dr. jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw, while snoring, then snorted up the powdered drug he had invented. funniest thing i'd ever seen in a movie.

who are the people that star in this thing? never heard of them!! but this is one of the funniest comedies i have run across. it should win the putz puller prize for parody. the absurd starts with dr. jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.he is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. pay attention to the hospital pa system in the background; rather like the system in mash. the final scene with hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years. oh... and the "busty nurse" is cassandra peterson, who went on to become elvira, mistress of the dark. if you liked the mel brooks classic movies (blazing saddles, etc.), i suspect you'd like this one.damn shame you can't get it on dvd anywhere.it's available on dvd now !!!!! good thing dvds don't wear out from use !!!!!

better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the american box office. at times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, jekyll and hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the woody allen of "everything you always wanted to know about sex" to the mel brooks of "the producers", saturday night live to monty python, carlin to cheech and chong. watch it, listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly, and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious.

uproarious no-brainer comedy in which comedian mark blankfield portrays jekyll as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research. once he's snorted his experimental formula, he's turned into the scenery-devouring hyde, causing no end of problems for everybody around him.i was pleasantly surprised by this one. it has a truly insane, madcap approach; it's full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another. funny lines and sight gags are in abundance; blankfield plays each role for all it's worth. one highlight has hyde bursting into song; "hyde's got nothing to hyde" is quite catchy and even now i can still hear it in my head. the climax even goes so far as to spoof old b & w horror films.the supporting cast is quite spirited as well, with bess armstrong as the ditzy fiancée mary, krista errickson as the spunky ivy, and tim thomerson as flamboyant fellow doctor knute lanyon. i do wish more could have been done with thomersons' character, as i'm a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something.a large array of familiar faces parade before the camera: cassandra "elvira" peterson, peter brocco, liz sheridan, george wendt, michael ensign, john dennis johnston, art la fleur, lin shaye, and george chakiris in a cameo as himself.it goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow, intelligent comedy, you'd better avoid this one at all costs. but for those who enjoy a zany, politically incorrect, gleefully raunchy good time, this just might do the trick.one of the best bits is saved for last.8/10

a mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. as i've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... classic lines such as (parapharsed) "i've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times i do it. you're a nurse, what can you give me for it?" nurse replies "all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..." great sound track.the classic "hyde's got nothing to hide". stays surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original stays in the way of a joke..... haven't met anyone with an iq over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical.

this is one of those rare comedies where try as you might, you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even laugh out loud. the lead actor's performance as hyde is pure manic genius. see if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation. good luck. :) on the downside there are times when the movie does bog down. it seemed longer than its 90 minutes.

so it's not an award winner, so what? have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? "the villain" and this one could top the list.my husband says that "jekyll and hyde together again" is one of those movies that if "you've been there and done that" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. i think the whole film is just fun. nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, howard hughes.... there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate. to say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true, but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also. i recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. we may be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew (ourselves?) back in the old days.

so it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 yrs old. amazingly enough i have this on beta tape and it still plays just fine. if it came to dvd i'd snap it up in a heartbeat.the drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then. then it wasn't as 'harmful'. much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. i can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this. i had coworkers in the 90's who'd seen it and i could bust them up by getting on the intercom and saying "iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy".great lines, great spoof of the original, and funny to me anyway even three decades later!

i loved this movie. mark blankfield was perfect for this role. more classic sci/fie/horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. a no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. can we expect more? let's hope so. i would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. mel brookes made some remakes of classic films.he made some very strong contributions. a picture of dorian gray would be a good suggestion. i hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. a good comedy fix.

i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax. as we all know, betamax went the way of the 8-trak tape, sigh, it really had nice picture quality too. anyways, i'm glad i found this movie again, i've been searching for it for more than 10 years! this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane: continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious. his transformation from the shy dr. daniel jekyll into the sex-crazed partyanimal mr. hyde is unforgettable, complete with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchains. the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woo's. totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it. when i first seen it, i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing. this is a movie i could watch over and over again. i highly recommend it.

this is sweet. the actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark. another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy munsin in king pin. this is most glorious story ever to be told. it should sell more copies than the bible. my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. the lady who gave the go ahead (friend of the family) was let go by the theater. i was 3 years old. i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd. it's beautiful.

mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde.michael mcguire was the dad.tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon.did you even see this movie? i doubt it!blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on fridays. thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it. i recorded this movie off of hbo back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. one of the funniest takes on the jekyll & hyde theme ever.of course. with all the cocaine references in this movie, it'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today, as would cheech and chong. too bad, because it is funny, funny, funny!

this film was one of three that were later combined by chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title "the chaplin review".this was an odd film in some ways because later in life, chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. this film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the us efforts in wwi. it's truly odd to see charlie as the "super soldier" who single-handedly captures 13 germans, casually and coolly shoots several germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the kaiser himself! truly, this was a major departure for the little tramp, though it was, at the same time, very very entertaining and funny. the film is exceptionally well-paced, well made and i'm sure did a lot to bolster support at home for our troops (too bad it was such a pointless and costly war).

chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. he spends time "over there" in world war one trenches. several gags stand out: limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. the cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. chaplin ends up capturing several german soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the german commander for refusing a cigarette. when asked how he did it, chaplin replies that he surrounded them. chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things, and those scenes are very very funny. he escapes to a bombed house where he meets up with a french girl played by edna purviance. he's tracked down by german soldiers, escapes from them again, and purviance is arrested for assisting him. chaplin is able to pull a fast one by bopping a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. he ends up saving purviance of course and capturing the kaiser in the process. along the way, chaplin employs some sight gags and slapstick in turning back the german soldiers. with this film, chaplin explored the location possibilities in filming while maintaining the audience's attention for closer to feature length time, something his contract with the mutual film corporation disallowed him. the film also allowed him to poke fun at the enemy, something he would again do to greater effect in the great dictator. *** of 4 stars.

pretty funny stuff. charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of world war one. daring because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business.the gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking. one successful scene follows another, as chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water. (that's where we got the term "trench foot" from.) probably the most ludicrous episode has chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of german soldiers as they try to execute an allied soldier caught behind the lines. edna purviance, chaplin's main squeeze at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the americans and is saved from execution too.chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period.

chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. the rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. he's in france for one thing: to fight the germans, something he does with unbelievable success.it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.

fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1.at first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. that's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!next thing you know he's in france in a trench. hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.when charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring. this is such a funny part! i can't really describe it, just watch the movie. when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up'. it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb... while charlie actually rubs his roommate's foot!the movie then turns a bit grim, as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench (although it's done in a very funny way) and him personating as a tree to get close to the enemy, saving a friend of his from a death squad.last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house. he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well. to do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something. i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he's like nein nein nein. the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero... but then he wakes up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream!charlie did one of those 'dream-sequences' before (the bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way. chaplin also has something to say with this movie (as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world) and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie: 'peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'in short: a charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.

i described woody allen's manhattan as perfect to someone the other day, and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie...i have seen only a handful of movies that i would call perfect. manhattan is one, mccabe & ms. miller by robert altman is another and once upon a time in the west by sergio leone is also another film that i think achieves perfection. there are a few others, but aside from the fact that i find no faults in the three i mentioned, i must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes.if there is one film that i could stand behind and bet the house that anyone i would show it to would find it flawless it's shoulder arms.city lights, the great dictator, the gold rush and even the pawnshop are 10's but not only did chaplin do everything right in this film, everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation.

charles chaplin's 'shoulder arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. with world war one just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and chaplin was no exception. and so the lovable tramp went to war! the film begins with the tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant. the tramp then finds himself in the trenches, faced with a more formidable foe, though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he. the uproarious moment when the tramp declares that he single-handedly captured thirteen german soldiers by "surrounding them" had me in stitches.there are plenty of other great moments in this film. chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface.however, the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers, unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy, as they are single-handedly disabled one-by-one are highly amusing, especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood.this is a very enjoyable film, and one of the best of chaplin's pre-1920 efforts. highly recommended.

this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. in fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent chaplin features (a dog's life, and the pilgrim) that chaplin re-released in the 1950s. in it's day shoulder arms was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. it still is very funny (chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age. charlie's dealing with world war i, a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst war (horrible to say) of the 20th century. chaplin would live to see that war too, and would spoof it's main architects in the great dictator. but the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture. also, hitler as a target seems more important to audiences in 2008 than kaiser wilhelm ii and his general staff.shoulder arms was to take us through the drafting of the tramp, his training, his getting use to trench warfare, and his actual fighting against the "huns" on the western front. much of this is now gone - one segment (when albert austin is a doctor examining chaplin in his office at the draft center) is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary unknown chaplin. this is unfortunate, because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long, and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out. what remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more...and feeling a trifle cheated.sydney chaplin and henry bergman do well in supporting parts, especially sydney as wilhelm. he had done it before in a short with charlie for the sale of bonds, giving a militaristic speech before being clobbered by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled "war bonds"). here we see the tramp succeed in capturing wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion. it was only topped by stan and ollie capturing the german army with a tank and barbed wire in pack up your troubles.the funny thing is that chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities. he was not a naturalized american - not in 1917 or in 1952, when attorney general mcgranery publicly announced that chaplin could not return to the u.s. because he was an enemy alien (chaplin and his family were in europe on a trip - in anger charlie settled in switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he made a countess from hong kong and when he went to hollywood for his special career "oscar" in the 1970s). because he was not an american he could not be drafted by the u.s. so he sold (with douglas fairbanks sr. and mary pickford) u. s. war bonds. but in great britain tens of thousands had perished in world war one battlefields, and the public there was upset at chaplin, who they considered a "slacker" and a coward. chaplin eventually did overcome this, but remnants of the resentment followed him until he died. this does not detract from the success of shoulder arms as a film, but it does suggest why chaplin did not do another modern war film until 1940, and a worthier target.

"strangers on a train" was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. i finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. you can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de bont's "speed." of course, "strangers" is over forty years older than "speed" and contains no modern special effects, but the visceral thrill is there - hitchcock was a true genius.the not-so-subtle gay side of bruno (robert walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies. consider him a male version of jennifer jason leigh in "single white female." he knows about guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with him.hitchcock loved the oedipial elements in his movies (also see "psycho" for more blatant undertones) and there's a lot of that here. bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. his effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951, when gays were not "allowed" to be portrayed on the screen - yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe, flirting with guy and responding to his mother.the deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it's being remade as a big-budget hollywood production, but after seeing the original i honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie.

even though some unrealistic things happen at the end (i.e. a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed), this still was an intense, enjoyable thriller, one of alfred hitchcock's better films. robert walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase, really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times. his co-star in here, farley granger, is okay but is no match for walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. it's the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent man gets in trouble, etc. unlike a lot of his other films, i thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots. being an ex-tennis player, i enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies. hitchcock's real-life daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. she didn't just get the job because of her dad; she can act. also of note: the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story. this is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films, even comedies such as "throw momma off the train."

alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the vertigo's and the psycho's is this film; strangers on a train, the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made. the story follows guy haines, a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the senator's daughter, if he can get a divorce from his current wife. one day, on the way to see his wife, he meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his life.the conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time. what if two people "swapped" murders, thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime, and rendering their motive irrelevant? could this truly be the perfect murder? what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any, normal everyday person. everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of, so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? the chances of it happening are unlikely, but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train; and in this situation, anyone could. is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker? the man was simply born for the part. he manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. the character of bruno is a madman, but he's not a lunatic; he's a calculating, conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable. his performance is extremely malevolent, and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. unfortunately, robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train, and i believe that is a great loss to cinema. nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does, but worth mentioning is his co-star farley granger. granger never really impresses that much, but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against walker. also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be. ruth roman is guy's wife to be. she isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression, but she makes the best of what she has. alfred hitchcock's daughter, patricia, takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara, the sister of guy's fiancé. she is suitably lovely in this role, and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in.alfred hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and it is very much so in this film. there is one shot in particular, that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. this is an absolutely brilliant shot, and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. hitchcock's direction is moody throughout, and very much complies with the film noir style. the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting, and i don't think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film. it's truly overblown, and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works. there is a reason that hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time, and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story, but he also uses to camera to do so as well. strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. its story is both intriguing and thought provoking, and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. a masterpiece.

one would have expected hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. but that is precisely what they got: strangers on a train.what is remarkable is how much bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join. guy is the archetypal american, the working-class boy made good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. bruno is his destructive opposite, gay, decadent, 'european' (he lives off his father, in a big house, and just lounges about dreaming of murder). bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas guy moves straight ahead. it is bruno's achievement to move guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force him to transgress (break the law, hope for murder (bruno's)).bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy. all the authority figures in the film are criticised - bruno's father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in aunt clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); anna's incredibly machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken. far from being the mother-hater of legend, hitch, as robin wood perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.bruno's transgression turns the world topsy-turvy. this is hitch's most surreal film. whenever guy is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventionally romantic music. but whenever bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, bizarre, much more fun. this is hitch's first truly american film, revelling in the primitive detritus of americana. grown men puncture little boys' balloons, or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains. elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees. washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting dali painting. there is one of the greatest, and funniest, scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless, smiling bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of magritte. just look at any scene with bruno in it, and watch it derail into the bizarre.phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (hitch had obviously just seen the third man) - as well as in more staid environs: washington will never look the same again. strangers is also, vertigo notwithstanding, hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses, there is the sustained homoeroticism, the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.and yet hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense. in the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. much has been made of bruno as a prototype of norman bates, and hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification, willing bruno into murder. there is a hilariously painful sequence where bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame guy down a drain. the gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience i was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. and hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions, and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.strangers is one of hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema. the dialogue is so strange and brilliant, i can't believe it wasn't written by chandler. patricia hitchcock is a wonderful imp, standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts guy. the fairground finale is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site. if bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the catholic precepts hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in the killers), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to guy's debased serving of self.

cam archer's lyrical bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by aaron platt) that is more vibe than narrative. caught somewhere between documentary and dream, bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early todd haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of gus van sant. with grit, glamour and heartbreak, it's kinda like the movie equivalent of sonic youth playing bubblegum pop.

beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. at any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or "artsy fartsy" as some people would say. i assure you, that after one viewing, "bobbycrush" will be stuck in your head. i know this from first hand experience. even the soundtrack is great. it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film. be thankful that cam archer exists in this world. we need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery.

dylan and bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are. but dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside. bobby knows that he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with dylan. told as part cheesy 80's pop video, part home movie, part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad, but all too often true, story that will hit home with many that see it. this film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but i wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note. yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there's always tomorrow, especially when we are young.

very enjoyable 50's western. i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans.mostly victor mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.he's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. they all joined as scouts after their loss.victor has set his eye's on the colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction. a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. one to enjoy. gave it a 7 rating. likely 6.8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time.for film-noir fans..."the big steal" "they live by night" "side street" are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. bought and viewed. noir seems to resemble westerns in a way. some long ago and never forever.

i enjoyed this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations, along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline. all the main characters are well cast. true, john wayne or robert mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well, but victor mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling tarzan of sorts. reminds me of his film role as samson, another difficult, but not impossible, man to tame.the mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before, with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts. this story supposedly takes place in oregon just before the end of the civil war. judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably mt. lassen), the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the cascades, as we never see any other civilians. however, there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of wyoming or montana! red cloud, the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort, is the namesake of a very famous sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in wyoming and montana. fort laramie(eastern wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort. the plains tribe of assiniboines is mentioning as joining red cloud. this aspect of the story, then, bears a general resemblance to historical fact.it may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of john ford's "fort apache". in both cases, we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with native american problems. he underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries, regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. in both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy.. also in common, the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local native americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. in both films, we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate, which the commander does everything to squelch. clearly, the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion.i also see certain resemblances with "the misfits". the soldiers, as a whole, including the commander, are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have "problems" or are raw recruits with no experience fighting native americans. the commander's wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort, thus is inherently a misfit, with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. the trappers, in turn, are also misfits, not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline, yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by red cloud. finally, we can also compare this story with anthony mann's later film "the far country", starring jimmy stewart. in stewart's case, he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy, at the end. but mature's character doesn't come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss. red cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. besides, he has an obsession with the commander's wife.

victor mature, as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper, may be on the poster, but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led his men to get "cut to ribbons" by confederate artillery at shiloh, and is sent to a fort in oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne bancroft. the uncivilized mature lusts for the colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man's wife at one point by james whitmore who plays mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure. directed by anthony mann, this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart, but even so you really don't need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing, although preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under submission, in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout.

this is another good western,which i enjoyed.it's not an epic or anything,but it is good for what it is.it' about 3 fur trappers,led by a men named jed,who is crude and uncivilized.jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and indian band,who resent the americans on their land,and want to take it back.that's the gist of the story.what follows is action,excitement,even a bit of humour,and forbidden romance.one of jed's friends,gus,reminded me a lot of the character quint(played by robert shaw)in the movie jaws.they both have that crusty,gruff demeanor.anyway,if you're a western fan,you should find lots to like about this particular entry.i think it deserves a 7/10

one of the more obscure of anthony mann's westerns, the last frontier was also his only cavalry western (aside from one brief episode in winchester '73), though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals. set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests, it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier, in many ways his fort apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits, failures, cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors, badly led while the civil war takes priority and all the best the army has to offer.victor mature and james whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the cavalry into their territory. rather than blame the indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them, ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead. but despite the best efforts of guy madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of robert preston's humiliated colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost  and mature's clumsy infatuation with the colonel's wife (anne bancroft, too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her)  soon drive matters into much darker territory. it's not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other, both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them: little wonder that at one point mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust, screaming "i would have died for this, but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag!" the stallone of his day, mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director. this is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part, perversely enough as a simple man  well-meaning but drunk, violent, uneducated and with a unsubtle, almost childlike lust for life, the part seems designed with burt lancaster in mind, with some striking similarities to his character in the kentuckian. but robert preston's ahab-like colonel is clearly the best role, determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal civil war engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board. in his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption, driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors. he's beyond salvation, but there's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely admires madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get preston's orders countermanded by their superiors  fatally skewed though it is.like its hero, the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any western), but that only tends to make it more interesting, and there are plenty of mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective, while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive. unfortunately the deficiencies of the early cinemascope lenses are very apparent in columbia's dvd, with the image often dark (2.55:1 cinemascope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial-and-error) and grainy.

`the last frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers jed (victor mature), gus (james whitmore) and mongo (pat hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly captain riordon (guy madison), colonel marston(robert preston) and corrina marston, colonel's wife (anne bancroft). hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the indians, jed, gus and mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.' jed, who has been raised by gus, both inspires and looks up to the `older' gus and mungo, and has an especially difficult time dealing with `civilization.' his real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife, corrina. colonel marstonis a reckless man, who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. corrina, a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and jed for what he is. caught in the middle is captain riordon, a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army, his strong friendship with jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness. what makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that, in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of `the last frontier' are exactly the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music)first, the screenplay. almost all of the subplots (particularly, the reckless colonel) have been done better elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. just when you think you know what is going to happen next, this one takes off in a different direction. possible spoiler: `the last frontier' being a `production code' movie (back in the day the word `virgin' was taboo), it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature, tolerant manner. i expected either jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. i was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending.second, the casting. mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of jed, the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods'. james whitmore, who plays gus, `the man who raised jed' is actually five years younger than mature. nevertheless, mature is very endearing, playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid. although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably, burt lancaster and kirk douglas), none could have played jed better. preston (also mature's junior) plays colonel marston, missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man. however, preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank. bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as corrina. bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde, and this achieves the same effect as it did for winona ryder (`edward scissorhands') and christina ricci (`sleepy hollow'). that is, i felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; i believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades. further, bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit, though). this enables the 24 year old bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the 37 year old preston; yep, she could be a colonel's wife. madison walks a careful balancing act as riordan, handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.playing a role similar to that of john wayne in `fort apache' madison does a more skillful job at it.this movie has a `silverado' type camaraderie. that alone makes it worth seeing. it also has memorable performances, beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. i just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost), because this movie takes full advantage of that format.

ordinarily, anthony mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - james stewart, gary cooper, henry fonda . . . the a list cowboy stars. but in this b+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. the main character, played by victor mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - robert redford in jeremiah johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men. not here. for once, a true mountain man - vulgar, crude, animalistic - is the central figure, and it's something to see, giving mature one of his better later roles. the real acting chops are provided by robert preston, excellent as a self-absorbed custer type cavalry commander, and james whitmore, the poor man's spencer tracy, as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other. even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer's wife, who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature's grisly character, then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize, to her own shock, that she's attracted to him. rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen, without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache. the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent, and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format. good show, and underrated movie, all around.

a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution. ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he won't " go along with the program " and sets out to let the world know what they're missing. the supporting cast is great as well, and the music is the "soul" of the film. i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library.

the sort of "little" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. sort of a "soul" version of the more well-known "the last of the blonde bombshells". ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes, as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque, derrick o'connor and antonio fargas. not meant to be an epic by any means, this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold.

better than average world war ii-era "who-dun-it" featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. crime doctor's courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. the link to "courage" is not particularly clear.this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr. ordway labels murder. hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso - a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage. as a mystery novelist, jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime.spooky houses with creaking doors, caskets in the cellar, and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense. the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good. direction, production design, and photography stand out. the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average "b" detective thriller.strongly recommended.

another nice entry in the crime doctor series [#4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets. and a more off-the-wall storyline too!a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. the crime doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder, and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed. was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife, the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke, the dancing brother and sister vampires, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie, the irreplaceable butler, or odds-on jerome cowan? police inspector emory parnell had his work cut out, but warner baxter as ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out. one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong: on breaking into the murder room ordway says "right through the centre of the forehead" and cowan replies "he didn't miss this time". favorite bits: baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party; the scene where the braga's place of repose is seemingly rumbled. the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram, but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn't do either!well worth a watch if you already like the genre, you won't be disappointed unless you really don't like the genre.

i saw this on tcm recently and, through the imdb i found that there were seven "crime doctor" movies with warner baxter as the psychiatrist-detective. baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd street a decade earlier. not noir, and a bit campy today, the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural. the plot, black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the mr. moto and charlie chan series. there are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances by a number of b movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (none ever made it to the a status). it is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.i would love to see a boxed dvd series of these films.

note: after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the original film. my mistake. i thought imdb for a database for movies, not tv shows. but since most people will look up this film under bagdad cafe and not out of rosenheim, which, strangely, is the name this film is listed under on imdb, i'll leave this comment here.maybe i missed something, but when i read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the cbs series -- which must have been loosely based on this film. i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not, but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film. this film is not like a tv show at all and whoopie goldberg is not in it or any other famous hollywood stars (other than jack palance, who was very charming in his role).this is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks "outside the box." it is not at all like a hollywood formula movie, which is probably why the (what's a nice word for idiots?) who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this one.first of all, this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get-go. from the music (which is just part of the time so you can't really call it a musical) to the cinematography to the really cool story.a german or bavarian woman (very pretty and quite plump) gets in an argument with the other german or bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the california desert with and parts ways with him --he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert-like highway out in the middle of nowhere.she finds the small and dilapidated but charming bagdad cafe, in bagdad, california and checks in. the rest of the story is magic. i don't want to try to describe this film because i want you to enjoy every surprise.warning: if you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie, as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as "part of the mix" without any racism involved.i gave this film a 10 for orginality, entertainment and sheer delightfulness.

you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when whistling in the dark opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.on top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales the fox (red skelton) tells his radio audience. you have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. but then, that's how unrealistic the comedy is.but--if you're a true red skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the '40s--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him. ann rutherford and virginia grey do nicely as his love interest and conrad veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. one of his more amusing moments is his reaction to skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. "i never knew that," he muses, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced.all in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are. not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat, the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off.

red skelton plays a radio detective known as "the fox" in "whistling in the dark," also starring ann rutherford, conrad veidt, eve arden, virgina grey and rags ragland. wally benton, aka "the fox" finds his plans to marry his fiancé carol (rutherford) thwarted when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (veidt). joseph jones (veidt) has just learned that his cult, the silver haven, is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who is going to be living off of the interest. he wants wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney. for backup, and because he's not sure which one is wally's fiancé, jones kidnaps carol and also the radio sponsor's daughter (grey).this, to me anyway, is a superior film to the second entry in this series, "whistling in dixie." the plot is better, the cast is better, there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes. skelton, when he's not making faces and rolling his eyes, is quite amiable, and rutherford is very good. veidt always played these evil men to perfection. eve arden is wally's agent, who arranges a date for him and grey to make sure his contract is renewed. i had only seen grey in films from the 1950s onward. she was always a good-looking woman, but who knew she was such a knockout in the '30s and '40s? this is a fun film with a neat cast.

there are 3 of these movies, all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing. red plays radio sleuth wally benton, aka the fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker, ann rutherford. many of the one-liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which i anticipated. but, just as many actually made me laugh out loud, which was unexpected to say the least. red skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprising i say because i grew up with a much older version of the man who's charm really didnt play well in my formidable years. i have to give these movies the go ahead though -if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare. i almost threw in light hearted, but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it, the suspense at times is well above average. as with most movies from this era, it gets a pi (politically incorrect) rating for reasons you can well imagine. wartime is funny that way i guess, and so then again are these movies. watch one, watch them all.

i caught this on local mexican television at 2:00 a.m. and i decided to give it a chance since it's based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical all american family (a dad, a mom, and a young son).on the beginning the hints point to walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father. shortly after, when walker and luke are taken to the sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different...also, when walker and luke attend to an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that luke would receive $200,000 and walker is out of the heresy. luke immediately buys a convertible.anyways, this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings, and cold , very cold blood.i know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same. give this movie a try. i know there are hundreds of "based on real murders" or events of the like, but this one is truly worthy. pure quality on acting, direction, and plot.

i thought the movie was good, but i like to read the real story behind the "based on a true story" movies. does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on? i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case. all i get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a "true story." i find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom, even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother (gorgeous john corbett), but overall the story was very gripping. anyway, if anyone knows the real "real story", i would appreciate you sharing it!

i don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while i did. i got so engrossed i gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. and i sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but i was crying at the end. a lot of emotional nuance. great acting, and good southern feel. john corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played luke was really good too. highly recommend.

tv churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime, and court tv can be relied on for a few every weekend. so i started watching the morrison murders thinking i knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. what i got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.both the brothers were totally convincing, and jonathan scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of luke. the look and feel of georgia was in almost every frame. if i had any complaint, it was gordon clapp as the sheriff. he just doesn't look or act like a small-town southern lawman named byron calhoun. he looks and sounds like medavoy, and medavoy is not right for this part.but this is a minor quibble: the morrison murders is well worth watching, and not just on a rainy saturday afternoon. if you're going out, tape it. you won't regret it.

like some people here, i love/loved stingers! in norway it got aired a lot later. that also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) i have to say that i really love stingers! it can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. i think i'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. stingers might be the on series(except from grey's anatomy) that i really watch! the actors are amazing! especially jacinta stapleton! personallly i think she is one of the best access we have! i know he is not like super-known, but she is really a great actress! stingers makes me want to be a cop! i love it!p.s: do you know if you can buy the episodes?

like a few people i know, i came in late on 'stingers'; not until 2000. three years later there is no way i'd miss an episode. the show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'blue heelers', for example. the crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! when gary sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me. gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series. the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh. with arguably australia's finest crew behind the scenes, 'stingers' will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series.

why take a perfectly good original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as a quasi-musical? and cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent? somewhat akin to "showgirls" or the two most recent "star wars" films, "lost horizon" is full of unintentional laughs. who can forget sir john gielgud smiling uneasily in his dali lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the republican party ("family")?or sally kellerman warbling lovingly to george kennedy, doing her best cher impression as she hops from one rock to another ("every little thing you do")? and my favourite, bobby van embodying the strength of america's education system ("question me an answer")? i can't wait for the dvd release, as hopefully it will contain comments by liv ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!

red skelton (in his first starring role) plays wally benton who plays 'the fox' on a radio show. he writes the murder mysteries and as 'the fox' solves them. joseph jones (conrad veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. he kidnaps benton, his girlfriend (ann rutherford) and another girlfriend (virginia grey). he tells benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...very funny and enjoyable movie. fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. veidt is excellent as the evil jones. rutherford and grey are lots of fun as skelton's girlfriends. all three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic. also fun to see eve arden in a small role.well worth your time.

i've seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what i got. you can be critical of the acting the singing, and dialog but that't not what i look for when i go to a movie. i look for a little release from my daily life, a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life, where people love another and help another. it's a shame we can't we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade essay. this may be very simplistic, but really, wouldn't it be nice.

the movie is excellent. acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring ronald coleman. that movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, i believe the impact was something akin to the first "starwars" movie in modern times. i have seen it. it was and is wonderful. but that does not mean that this version is not also worthy. from the first scene the 1973 version grabs you. the noise and tumult are fantastic, especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of shangri la. and burt bacharach's music is beautiful. so - by all means enjoy the 1937 version. but do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 king kong destroy peter jackson's of this year.

i recently purchased lost horizon on ebay, having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from childhood (i am an ancient 29). i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based. i was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure. a wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by james hilton). sally kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic sally hughes, who gradually warms to the charms of shangri-la. only liv ullmann flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher (a role far more suited to a julie andrews type. the fact that finch, ullmann and hussey are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell. the songs do vary in quality, the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper dvd release and a lot more recognition.

i have to offset all the terrible comments. i love this movie. i own the movie and the soundtrack. i watch it whenever i need a pick me up. granted it's not like the sound of music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. i adored the late (and great) bobby vann, and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. i saw this when it first came out in the theaters. i'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in "the boyfriend". it's a modern musical and shouldn't be judged by all that went before. it's just the best for dreamers like me, who wish they could find this place - no illness, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. this is nothing more than a feel good movie. that is what all movies should be about. shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie. if the acting isn't the greatest-who cares. i love the idea of the movie. peter finch, a very stiff actor, liv ullmann, gorgeous as ever, sally kellerman, surprisingly good voice, michael york, typical, and olivia hussey, stunning, all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people. not one of them acted like actors in a movie. they acted like real people, the same way i would act if i found this place. torn between going home and staying there, in awe of everything. yes, there are flaws in this movie, but get over it, it's not citizen kane, it's a feel good musical!

the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time. the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical shangri-la! is a real special gem. music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david. a strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states, but made a lot of money overseas. only in america did it fail. highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical, it deserves far better credit than it's given. as a story, lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 frank capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel. what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. this is a burt bacharach shangri-la and it's a wonderful place. songs like the world is a circle, share the joy and living together, growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel. why shouldn't shangri-la be a slightly goofy place? the two love songs, i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture. there's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story. moreover, the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody. it's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping, singing and dancing on tables? they're a wonderful team and the number is well staged. i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri-la. the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. he has no hope for the world outside of shangri-la. if this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, richard onway's conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in shangri-la.of course, for the film to be believable, the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard. did conway find shangri-la or was it imagined? did they all die in the plane crash? every man has his own idea of what his shangri-la would be. the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangri-la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman, kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. interesting how conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. both versions of lost horizon work in different ways, but both are successful in probing james hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. so in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals. it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. one has to remember that lost horizon in 1973 was post cabaret. it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics. the expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. there were two targets to be hit, the producer, ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them. ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster airport that film was universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. it was nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture. at the time, burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country. the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider, midnight cowboy and the godfather. sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. it's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. it's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? lost horizon '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.

i was about 14 years old as i saw the musical version of lost horizon. i loved the film so much as well as the songs that i went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. my mother bought the lp and i learnt the songs off by heart, just as i did with "the sound of music" (which people hardly know in austria). i think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager. maybe he is an ingrid bergman fan but i was happy with liv ullman. could ingrid bergman sing and dance? what was so great about her? perhaps the critic did n't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between liv ullman and bill clinton. it was the idea and story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects. it's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are utterly boring in comparison.

this version of "the lost horizon" is actually not a bad film at all. i think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. i saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (i was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (burt bacharach has always been a favorite.) the story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all. i have this film on video and watch it every so often...and i enjoy it each and every time!

i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. it is just not available and it has not been on tv for many many years. i enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.my 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. someday i hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it. (oh would i love to see it again too!)

i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. since then i've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when i ordered it from moviehunter. sorry to say it doesn't hold up. this glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. i love burt bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and i even bought a cd of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. just doesn't fit. michael york is lost here. sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas. the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama.

really, this movie should be released to dvd. i just got a bootleg copy of what i think was a studio film and i was utterly pleased!!! it was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. three of my people, michael york, olivia hussey. both having been in romeo & juliet, and also john gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone i thought that for the small amount i was spending it would be fine. boy was i right. i'm not going to give any of this one away, you may already know the story anyway, but i'll just say if you can get yourself a copy in any format...do it!@ you won't be sorry. jpc

while many pass this off as a b movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. red skelton is great as wally benton better known to radio fans as the fox. ann rutherford is perfect as wally's fiance carol lambert. conrad veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. i read one account of this movie which states that vincente minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to s. sylvan simon, who directed all three of the fox movies. this is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged. so get over your black and white prejudice if you have one, sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy. this was also red's first starring role. take note during the climax of the reference to orson welles' war of the worlds broadcast.

as a film buff, i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being woody allen's quip "if i had my life to live over again i wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon"). therefore i've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. he really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film - so did i. there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon, and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. it isn't even especially camp. the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since liv ullmann, olivia hussey and peter finch were dubbed (brilliantly too, as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly), and sally kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. vocally, kellerman's duet with olivia hussey on "the things i will not miss" is excellent. special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles boyer's brilliant performance as the high lama - and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. i wouldn't claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece (the things i wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography, and bobby van's "question me an answer" number, which could easily have been cut), but if you haven't even seen lost horizon, or haven't seen it for some time, try watching without that "oh boy, let's have a laugh at this pile of junk" attitude, and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is.

the retelling of a classic story is set to the music of burt bacharach and lyrics of hal david. the actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical shangra-la. it is a joy to watch bobby van, whose acting puts me in mind of red buttons, and, as always, george kennedy (cool-hand luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. the surprise here is charles boyer as the elder high lama. who would have known? all-star cast including michael york and olivia hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.

is there any question that jeffrey combs is one of the true horror greats? this movie seriously doesn't suck and is sort of funny... watching a young combs at work is great but i wish he had had more lines. look out for beyond re-animator. it's going to kick some azz.

i turned 13 when elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first rca hit. a year later buddy holly stepped in to give the king some competition. one of buddy's major talents, besides his unique singing style and his songwriting ability, is often downplayed. buddy was also a skilled lead guitar player, developing a unique rockabilly style all his own on his fender strat. gary busey attempts to capture this aspect of buddy's persona. there were other contemporary master guitar rockers of equal caliber, such as chuck berry, carl perkins, and eddie cochran, but buddy's talent is often overlooked.as noted by others, busey is the driving force behind the success of "the buddy holly story." not only does the script play with the facts of buddy's life, but it even interjects several anachronisms for the two years of buddy's popularity, basically 1957-1959. one that comes to mind is the scene where buddy and maria are watching a 3-d movie. buddy is disenchanted with it all and tells maria that it'll never last. it's just a fad. in reality there were no 3-d movies in circulation at the time. the heyday for 3-d was in the early 1950's. by 1955 the fad had already faded. yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believable.at times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding buddy's career. the story about how the crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie. another problem with the film is how buddy's parents are depicted. certainly buddy's parents were supportive of his musical career. "maybe baby" is credited to buddy's mother and she did have input into the writing of the song.it's good that buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie, but i miss hearing one of my favorites, "i'm looking for someone to love." i'm proud that as a result of this movie, buddy's music was reissued for a new generation to hear. his legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock 'n' roll. rave on, buddy, rave on.

the buddy holly story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 lubbock, texas. as the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. it's a tracking shot welles and scorcese would both appreciate. it cuts to buddy holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio. a young gary busey plays buddy holly and his performance is key. he has to somehow show the passion that holly had for his music to make the film work. this is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. this isn't about a man with several women to choose between in a sex scandalized, brood abandoned lusty tragedy. this is a film about a nice texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. busey finds that spark and ignites it, his passion is clear and infectious. he really plays the guitar in the film and sings, its not overdubbed with holly's recordings. busey was a young guy in hollywood in the seventies, a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well. thus, he gives a great performance, because although he isn't buddy holly, he's in a similar situation. his first song is the old les paul classic, "mockingbird hill" and he has the country twang to nail it. next a kid calls out for some bop, and against his two band mates (in reality the crickets were 3 guys, but the down-sizing works fine for the film's limited narrative)he leads them wailing into "rocking with ollie vee". the kids love it and the parents hate it. the dj at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in new york without buddy holly even knowing it was ever recorded. this leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments. an amped-up disc jockey from buffalo calls up buddy at home. the dj has been playing "that'll be the day" for 12 hours and is going for 24. the cops are banging on the station's barricaded door. holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is quite thrilled. he tells the boys, and their meteoric rise begins. dan stroud as the drummer and charles martin smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other. there are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock (all?) biopics. the movie doesn't manipulate you either. your emotions soar, but they're not manipulated. when the crickets step onto the apollo stage in harlem, the first white group ever to play there, then rip into an electrically charged performance of "oh boy" and win the audience over, my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried. next, busey and the boys make "it's so easy" sound funkier and more soulful than i would have believed possible. anyone with even a cursory knowledge of buddy holly's story will know where this movie will end. holly died in a plane crash with richie valens and the big bopper way too young. we, as the audience know that, yet the movie is so well written, directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately. the movie isn't about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. the film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of buddy holly. i was happy to hear him end it on "not fade away", my favorite of his songs. the film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash, but i hardly noticed it. i was still thinking about how good that last song was.

i was fortunate enough to be an extra in this movie when i was about 13 during the roller rink scenes. my junior high school drama class was invited to participate. it was a fantastic experience.gary busey, charles martin smith and don stroud played the music live, all day! as a musician, i can appreciate the tireless work and dedication these guys put in to their roles. they must have played those songs 20 times. it's very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under those conditions. this is visible during a cut to a close-up on "that'll be the day," but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldn't have picked it up.skating around all day, getting the day off from school and being transported back in time was a incredible thrill. i also had my first "date" on film. i had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth. woo hoo! even with an out-of-date haircut and hot lights melting the vaseline in my hair, it was still worth it. fun stuff.the movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole. busey delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb. i'm glad to have participated in a great film of the day. to think i could have been in corvette summer or something. not.a funny ironic ending to this is that years later i was in a video store in malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video. gary busey walked in and stood right next to me. i showed him the cover and babbled on how great he was and how i was an extra and whatnot. pretty weird, but very cool, for what it's worth.

i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. he wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, chuck berry or jerry lee lewis, but he wasn't far behind. who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. almost every single he put out was a hit.so, i was very pleasantly surprised how good a job gary busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice. he did buddy proud, as were the actors (don stroud and charles martin smith) who played holly's backup group, "the crickets."music-wise, there are some of holly's better-known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as holly and the boys are shown in iowa in their last concert ever. busey not only sings like holly, he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. some thing was the actor''s best performance ever, and you get no argument from me.i'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that iowa concert, instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. the ending could have been a real downer, but they didn't let it be.

set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural italy, it's a story of madness. the landscape may be quite picturesque, but there's madness herein, concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. this person kills little children.in style and tone this film resembles dario argento's famous italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror films, except that argento's films are much better looking. still, the visuals in fulci's "don't torture a duckling" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the "ducklings" is vulnerably alone.in one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. but this is no slasher film. a legitimate theme undergirds the story. and that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic.plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn't assume an agenda on the part of the director. don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. the twist near the end provides good misdirection. however, in one scene midway through, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. the film's finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. we see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset.i don't care for the film's widescreen projection. but background music is effective, and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low-key jazz, to indigenous italian songs. acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it's a bit overdone.though not as visually brilliant as argento's giallos, "don't torture a duckling" nevertheless is a fine film, one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.

if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore, guts and zombies, you have to watch this (and "the psychic" too, for that matter). even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence, and a unsettling subject matter, it's not the main thing here. this is a truly impressive, story and character-driven murder mystery that might well be the director's masterpiece. here, he proves that he's a real craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary. it also has a great cast, including the gorgeous barbara bouchet, as well as tomas millan (from beatrice cenci) and irene pappas in a small but important role. still, it is brazilian actress florinda bolkan (who also stared in fulci's bizarre "lizard in a woman's skin") who steals the scene in the role of majara, giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions, and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. the second star of the movie is sergio d'ofizi's cinematography who, along with the melancholic morricone-esquire score by riz ortolani, help bringing the "secluded italian village with a dark secret" setting to life. i have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off, but nonetheless, this is a definite italian horror classic - a moving, sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius. 10/10 for me. if you liked this one, i recommend watching alfred sole's "alice, sweet alice", as they are somewhat similar, and are both underrated gems.

the name "lucio fulci" congers up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans. thanks to movies like "zombi 2", "city of the living dead", "the beyond" and "the new york ripper", fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history. and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of "zombi 2" in 1979 fulci's films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he's know for, in fact they were for the most part gore free, instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work. "don't torture a duckling" hardly contains any gore, yet ranks as his best."don't torture a duckling" is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic. the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different, often shunning them. after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town, including andrea martelli (thomas milan) who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen.this is a remarkable film. it's very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema. it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci. but the real draw of "don't torture a duckling" is the disturbing nature of the movie. little kids, around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people, visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman. it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church. it is for reasons like this that "don't torture a duckling" was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states. still, "don't torture a duckling" stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulci's best work. i really can't recommend this one enough, check it out.

if you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best italian detective story (giallo), fulci has done.it's not mickey spillane for sure. there are scenes designed to disturb anyone.many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. she was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. she also tries to tempt the local priest.young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. you have to watch carefully to discover the killer. can you? don't jump on the first guy, it's way too early, and he is too obvious.anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer, who died a violent death at the end. what crazy reasoning he had.

being a seasoned fan of italian thrillers and directors dario argento, mario bava, sergio martino and aldo lado, i thought of lucio fulci as an overrated hack. i had seen the beyond which i think is totally overrated, i found the new york ripper to be simply appalling and i didn't particularly like the house by the cemetery. these three movies left me to conclude that fulci is the least interesting of these italian filmmakers. but my stubbornness prevailed and i had to check out more of his films. city of the living dead was a film i found very interesting but don't torture a duckling is very nearly a masterpiece.set in a small town in the italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered. the authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes, especially after their prime suspect has been cleared. an eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl (who seduces young boys) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it.brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case with 70's italian thrillers) make don't torture a duckling a crackling good thriller. the plot is well constructed, not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals, particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk. fulci's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled. when thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo new york ripper it's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. so far i haven't seen any fulci film made as professionally as this one.while not a traditional giallo film, duckling has many of the genre's trademarks. fulci displays complete control over the format, only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment, but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics. the extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch.so far don't torture a duckling is fulci's best film by far in my opinion. edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot.

don't torture a duckling (lucio fulci - italy 1972).definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that's quite an achievement in giallo-land. originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "don't torture donald duck", literally translated from its italian title. a small donald duck figure features briefly as a toy, but hardly enough to render a title like this, but, apparently, it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by disney. i railed quite a bit against fulci's earlier lizard in a woman's skin (1971), but here all the right ingredients are present. a surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. everything just clicks. i think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements.the story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain-side town in sicily, where someone is killing young teenage boys. among the suspects, the most obvious one is a young woman, maciara (florinda balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies. guiseppe, the village idiot is under suspicion as well, since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap. by the time a quick-witted newshound (tomas milian) arrives from milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions, when he meets two other potential suspects: don alberto, the local priest (marc porel) with a high-minded attitude, and patrizia (barbara bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense, who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town. talk about your prime red herring.fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the sicilian hills, past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. one could debate about the film's political stance as the north versus the south, or as commentary on small-town virtues - society's conventions in general - that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration, chaos and - ultimately - self-justice by the populace. the film has often been lambasted because of its anti-catholic tone, but it's hardly an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons, which would be giving away too much. it's actually rather tame compared to a film like joël seria's don't deliver us from evil (1971). probably, the film's rather unflattering portrayal of small-town sicilian values (when another boy is killed, the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynch-mob) might be cause for some offense in sicily, but - considering sicily's problematic relation with the rest of italy - hardly problematic for other italians, i would think. the film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway.when talking fulci, the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion. although eyes-gouging scenes are lacking, the film does contain two very graphic scenes. in the gross-out finale, the killer falls of a cliff, smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results (albeit, not very realistic). and the chain-whipping sequence with florinda balkan in the graveyard shows fulci's penchant for sadistic violence and typically, he's not holding back at graphically showing what most film-makers would merely hint at. surely, one of the most horrifying scenes in fulci's repertoire. above all, this is a taut, well-written, effective little mystery, nicely lensed by fulci, with an impressive cast of genre-regulars like barbara bouchet, marc porel (not very convincing as a priest), tomas milian and florinda balkan (mouth-foamingly crazy as the town's witch).camera obscura --- 8/10

lucio fulci's "don't torture a duckling" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.this surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.the soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;bruno's near-seduction by the naked patrizia(barbara bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite "house with the windows that laugh"(1976).

in a small, picturesque sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young, sexually curious boys. the local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects, including voyeuristic village retard giuseppe (vito passeri) and an elusive, grungy, voodoo doll-poking backwoods witch named maciara (florinda bolkan). there's also don alberto (marc popel), a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school, andrea (tomas milian), a journalist helping to aid the police, and the beautiful patrizia (barbara bouchet), a gorgeous, but seriously screwed-up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very (i mean, very) young boys. as typical with the giallo subgenre, the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames, but if you can hang in there long enough, this film pays off. the script (written by fulci, gianfranco clerici and roberto gianviti) keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work, cinematography (by sergio d'offizi) and musical score (by riz ortolani). the acting, particularly bolkan, is also very good. fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like the beyond and zombie will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate, but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery (bizarrely, yet effectively, set to singer ornella vanoni's ballad "quei giorni insieme a te") and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film the psychic (1977). scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen (except for a brief strangulation), but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses. the film was not released theatrically in america and, presumably because of some anti-catholic elements in the storyline, received only a limited theatrical release in europe.

i didn't know what to expect when i rented this widescreen dvd. i knew it had a cult following but i had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. don't torture a duckling actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. and after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. one major caveat: i would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read english subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.

don't torture a duckling is one of fulci's earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical "bloodbath" that fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film.the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those "helping" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...don't torture a duckling is neither a "classical" giallo or a typical fulci gore film. although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci's later works). this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair, don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10

sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes featurette than a grisly giallo, "don't torture a duckling" (1972) is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror maestro lucio fulci. in this one, someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural, southern italian village and, typical for these gialli, there are many suspects. there's barbara bouchet (patrizia), looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal; florinda bolkan (martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft-practicing beau; giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet-faced priest; his dour mother; and on and on. the film features some unusually violent set pieces, including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard (one of the most realistically bloody sequences that i've ever seen) and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed. the film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural backdrop, unsettling child murders, oddball characters, and freaky score by riz ortolani. the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be monte sant'angelo, near the adriatic in southern italy (at least, that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits). and while subtitling would've made this fine-looking dvd work even better (the american slang doesn't convince in this rural italian setting), anchor bay is to be thanked for another job well done. oh...that title does eventually make perfect sense, too!

i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio fulci's reputation as a director. too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. true, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream american production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. don't torture a duckling is yet another story! this film is a pure gem of the italian shock cinema! i easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror. the film shows the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a small italian mountain-town. the bodies of 3 young boys are found, horribly mutilated. there are quite a lot of pseudo-madmen in the town but every trail leads to nowhere. among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman, obsessed by witchery and voodoo. like a true mastermind, fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film. he portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre happenings, supported by a giddy soundtrack. fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here. the script always is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will mislead you more than once. in other words, this is a unique giallo (horror slash murder mystery). the gore isn't presented as grotesque and explicit as in lucio's later milestones (among them are the legendary zombie 2, the beyond and the new york ripper), although there still are a few nauseating and hard-to-watch shock-sequences shown. don't torture a duckling is the most compelling and effective achievement lucio fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest italian horror movies ever made. right next to the masterpieces made by mario bava and dario argento. the film is fascinating from start to finish, some plot aspects are alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenalin-rushing at all times! a must see for horror fans and an absolute priority for italian shock-lovers!

this is lucio fulci at his best. if only all the films he made after were like this.this extraordinary film is as intriguing as dario argento´s "the bird with crystal plumage"... if you´re an argento fan but you don´t like lucio fulci films, like"the beyond", "manhattan baby", "the house by the cemetery", etc. this one has nothing to do with the others... this is what the italians call "giallo"... that would be something like a "who-done-it" movie in a nutshell.you won´t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film.but apart from that, there´s the plot: some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys... a journalist (tomas milian), a sexy young woman (barbara bouchet), a priest (marc porel), his mother (irene papas) and a witch (florinda bolkan) are the main characters in this tangled, bloody story.talking about the actors, i want to say that tomas milian is superb (like always), and florinda bolkan is terrific as the village witch...do you want to know who is the killer?... i cannot tell you... but i can tell you that you must see this film!.(10 out of 10)... of course!

as far as i know i've seen most of lucio fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on dvd now, and i would have to say this was his best "pre-zombie" offering. in fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. this is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. it's no mystery how they died, i guess, it's more who's doing it. is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town, who used to do a lot of drugs? is it the village idiot, who gets nabbed early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? you'll only know if you watch, and watch you should, for this is a top-notch mystery thriller, or should i say, a "giallo". i've seen this before but it's been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time. for those of you that only know lucio fulci for his zombie flicks, well, open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the "monsters" in this are human, they're as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars, see it! please....

lucio fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like the beyond and zombie, was years earlier a master of the italian giallo (in the company of argento and bava) with films like a lizard in a woman's skin and his masterpiece, don't torture a duckling. this film has all the elements of the italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. this keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. who is killing the young boys in town? the young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts the eventual victims, the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shot, the townswoman with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, the town idiot....the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve. the themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect italian style in the early 1970s. it is certain that no american studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content, and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing) and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it. as the saying goes, they don't make them like this anymore, so get a copy and cherish an important film like this one!

this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. that would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. the theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. as with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. alas, we probably will never know.

a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention... ben daniels is fascinating (and courageous) to watch.

i love this movie, though i don't like how they picture egyptians, being an egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.the relationship between augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.a very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch augustin's reaction.. all in all i find it enjoyable, and i'm looking forward to reading the short story by balzac.

a film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of "the english patient," even down to a scene similar to when ralph fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. in "a passion in the desert," the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). historically expanded from a very short balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 of 10)

the story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. he started out as an officer in napoleon's army fighting in egypt but became separated from his unit. after nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. it brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. all things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter. a very strange film, well written and portrayed. beautiful scenery from jordan and utah which didn't always blend perfectly, but who cares.

what an incredible story and what a beautiful film! hat's off to ben daniels, lavinia currier and the great honore de balzac. this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. i watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. this film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world. both are capable of affection, yet ironically, it's the more "evolved" one who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the other's freedom. it's one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love, and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes. only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality.

an excellent story well told by the film maker. the interactions between the man and the leopard brought many questions to the viewers mind about just who was being humane. the humans killed for no reason the animals only to survive. at the end of the movie you were left wondering just who the real "hero" of the movie was. a well told story. the human actor did an excellent job but the leopard stole every scene it was in.

this movie is beautiful in all ways. it is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. the acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. there is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. it is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience. it isn't a movie for anyone who wants normality.

my opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases. i tend to lean toward the artsy, imaginative, and different. this movie was reminiscent of frances ford's "the black stallion" wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural. unlike those nature films, this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars (the cat) on the screen.this fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier (he is very nice too) lost on the egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned egyptian temple is mesmerizing. i bought into it wholeheartedly. if you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it.the only flaw in my book was the ending. it was a perfect set up for a romeo and juliet finale - that would have taken me over the top.

i remember reading the original balzac story in college french.i remember ken nordine of wgn-tv in chicago reading it as one of his late night shows.always loved the story but never believe they could or would make a movie of it. to my surprise they did and did it very well.few of any balzac stories lend themselves to dramatization, which is unfortunate, and -cat lover that i am, i was always hoping it would be filmed without a lot of hollywood sexing up. this is as close to perfect conversion as could be done.the theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but this is as close as i think it can come to letting the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing.

honore de balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling, albeit breathtakingly filmed, treatment here as a sort of forbidden-love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century. thin and very blonde english actor ben daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled(?) french painter across the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the gobi desert. after literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again, thus each decides (against better judgment mind you) to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found. this is of course how daniels' character comes to encounter the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end. the exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialog, somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish. while it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you, i find it to be a subtle, though decidedly left-of-center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor ben daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one), which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me! overall, i think that "passion in the desert" takes a while to warm up to, but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything; and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig, monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout. (***** out of *****)

i recently stumbled across a tv showing of "passion...." (having missed the opening scenes). ms currier in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de balzac tale to the screen. i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture. it must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert. and i cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine "performance" from the leopard, simoon. (this adverture calls to mind another suspenseful adventure, "naked prey"). why isn't this film more well-known?. hope i can find it on video.

passion in the desert exemplifies spatial grander. it is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. passion was filmed on location in the deserts of jordan, egypt, morocco, namibia, and tunisia. we are in egypt, 1798. augustin, a napoleanic soldier, is escorting writer and artist jean-michel venture de paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw, and paint the cultural landmarks of the egypt: its dunes, stupendous ruins, and mysterious people. but, can you truly "document" majestic sandscapes, fractured edifices, and wild bedouins? can you truly capture the essence of egypt, nature, man, and time?jean and augustin become lost in the mesmerizing glittering, gold desert, whose vastness overwhelms their senses. "you can't get lost in egypt! there's the nile, and there's the sea!", says the dehydrated augustin, and soon he discovers an ancient, winding cave that leads to a palatial ruin. delirious and near-delusional, he attempts to rest; a perplexing sound rouses him; his eyes, body, and emotions become hypnotically locked in time as he stumbles into a sensual, sensory experience.... a wild, sleek female leopard stares back at him, and their love affair begins....a daring love affair, a daring film.

this movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome. i just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it. the acting was very good, hot women and some scary parts. it is plain and simply worth the money to pay for.

it's one of the best movies that i have seen this year ! i don't agree with the person who said it's boring. of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all, but personally i spent a very good moment. this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes. there is also a nice touch of humor. for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father, and then her husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you", and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games :d very funny ! i recommend this movie to everyone, and by the way, sorry for my poor english (i'm from france).

this movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the french connection.the seven ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the nypd. scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. they are running surveillance on a local costra nostra cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out.meanwhile, richard lynch, the most evil looking man in film (invasion:america, little nikita) and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from scheider in the coolest chase scene i've seen, bullitt and french connection are not as good as they one up the west side to the george washington and onto the palisades parkway in new jersey. the stunt drivers are terrific and lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip. roy scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off. things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence. quick moving and intense, fresh for a thirty years.

while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics, both are way above average. roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type; a tough, courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering. (he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws. not nearly as gritty, but the same "get the job done despite the politicians" and gutsy approach. if a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd, to confront a huge killer shark, isn't gutsy, then tell me what is...).tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; most of the villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city: gritty, unglamorous, often dangerous, but filled with energy. the story is spare, tight, and subtle; it gets the job done without extraneous elements. it may not be one of the all time greats, but it is an exceptionally good movie.everyone has an opinion about car chases. mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt. the pontiac ventura/chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6. the ventura/novas got little respect off the drag strip, but with the proper suspension mods, they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track. the bawling of those gm v8's as they wind up is music to the enthusiast's ear. i've heard this chase criticized for "imitating" the bullitt chase. the truth is that they are two works by the same master, bill hickman, who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase. besides driving most of the car chase scenes, he created a brooding, malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers.yes, the chase has "realism errors" often noted, like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway, the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only, and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm. that's beside the point. let's face it: movie car chases are "unreal" by nature. in bullitt, the french connection, and the seven ups, however, bill hickman and phillip d'antoni crafted chases far more realistic, and therefore more exciting, than the flying, rolling, exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films.

this movie has a great chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other , it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie bullet, you'll hear the shifting of a 4 speed and they'll show the brake pedal in roy schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal!, i think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car they are in, like the guy is nuts!.........the crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in the the first rocky movie, rocky's boss. good movie! also when the door gets ripped off you can see the guy sitting in the car just flinging the door open, the guy who helps him out of the car kind of looks like mr brady from the brady bunch doesn't he?

buddy manucci(roy scheider, solid in a chance leading role)heads a secret undercover police squad called the seven-ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. they get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press, and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab. buddy has a pal from childhood named vito(tony lo bianco)who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in nyc. what buddy doesn't know is that vito is hatching a scheme using names from buddy's "check list"(he has this book open taking down notes provided by vito, but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind)to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two cop-posers, moon(the always-villainous richard lynch)and bo(bill hickman)working with him. when this scheme goes awry, with one of the seven-ups being killed, vito becomes fearful because he knows how buddy can be when he's doggedly after someone..especially when one of his own is murdered.extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping cop-imposter's trying to get them after killing his partner. the film isn't overly complex after the plot is set-up and we realize who is the ring-leader in the scheming of mobsters. scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor. he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him. the film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime-spree against evil mob families can get cops killed.

a team of tough rogue new york cops led by the rugged, hard-nosed buddy manucci (superbly played by the always excellent roy scheider) go after a group of nasty mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their number gets killed by them. director philip d'antoni, the producer of "bullet" and "the french connection," ably creates a potent, gritty, starkly amoral no-nonsense tone, maintains a steady pace throughout and stages the action scenes with considerable rip-roaring vigor. don ellis' rousing string score further pumps up the raw'n'rattling intensity while the scrappy big apple locations and urs furrer's rough, grainy cinematography both greatly enhance the overall grungy realism. moreover, the fine line distinguishing cops from criminals gets chillingly blurred in this picture: the titular squad use harsh, brutish and morally dubious strong-arm tactics as a means to an end for enforcing the law and there's certainly no code of honor amongst the thugs and thieves who populate the seedy urban underbelly that's vividly depicted in this movie. nice supporting performances by tony lo bianco as wormy, sniveling snitch vito lucia the undertaker, richard lynch as vicious psychotic hoodlum moon, bill hickman as moon's equally coldblooded partner bo, jerry leon as funky flatfoot mingo, and joe spinell as a parking garage attendant. an extremely wild and exciting protracted heart-in-your-throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight. the climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods. a real bang-up little winner.

"the seven-ups" seems like a replay of "the french connection," which was released two years prior. both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances, as well as stunt driver bill hickman.but we aren't dealing with french drug baddies; instead, we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum. we get to see unpleasantness and a pre-1990s new york city.i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action, and it is a reminder of a cooler time. that said, when one compares the car chases, mr. hickman had involvement in the three most compared: this movie, bullitt and the french connection. each chase scene has its own qualities, and this one is simply superb.and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd.

having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's, watching a film like "the seven-ups", or its kindred spirit, "the french connection", always evokes fond memories of a time and place which, for some, might have been nyc's darkest hour, but which for me, in my early twenties, was always one fun-filled adventure after another. i truly miss those times. as one reviewer remarked, "this film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the nyc winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture.". a spot-on characterization of both the film and the city. the stellar attributes of this film -- the plot, the cast, the characters, and of course, the car chase -- are amply described in many of the reviews here, so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase, when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman. the look of horror on richard lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out-of-character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it, that it is actually comical to watch. i get a chuckle out of it every time.

i was born in '68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv (as a kid in the 70's). i always loved this movie (and the french connection) and would always try to catch it whenever it was on (checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time). i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say, i still love it!!!! roy s. was a great actor from the 70's (jaws is one of my all-time favs, marathon man etc) and although the 7-ups is not an oscar-worthy film, it puts you precisely in a time a place (ny, early 70's, as did french connection) and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time. and yes, the car chase is one of the all-time best.

octavio paz, mexican poet, writer, and diplomat, who received the nobel prize for literature in 1990, said about "nazarin": "nazarin follows the great tradition of mad spaniards originated by cervantes. his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly". a humble and spiritual priest (francisco rabal in a wonderful performance) attempts to live by the principles of christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder. nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th-century mexico, offering help to poor and begging for food. his two followers, a murderous prostitute andara and her sister beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love, consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road. he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker. bunuel tells the story in a manner of a christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. the film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic, and heartbreaking.i consider bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever. i've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch, the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor, and his dark and shining fantasies. with great pleasure i am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic-comedy "nazarin" to the list of my favorite films.

you know i've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good. but running out of time was great.i guess what made it so good was the fact that andy lau and ching wang, have such great chemistry. the film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack,lol. in terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested. lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld. also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since "house of flying daggers".the movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner. definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact in to one, 8 out of 10

when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated. well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro (and the musics very funky). this show is mostly well written. i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk. i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories. this next sentence contains spoilers: my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is concocted in spiderman 3 the movie. i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it. i believe stan lee wasn't a fan.

though, short lived "the amazing spider-man" was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero. only "wonder woman" (lynda carter) (the best of the genre and "the incredible hulk" (bill bixby, lou ferrigno) were better."the amazing spider-man" outclasses the 1966-1968 "batman", because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. "spider-man" outclasses all three television interpretations of "superman"- "lois and clark", "smallville", and of course the george reeves "superman" which brings up the rear."the amazing spider-man" was an action drama, during the late 1970's, the pre-cgi era, when stunts had to be performed by stunt men, not in the database of a computer. "spider-man" had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics. his name was fred waugh, who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences. nicholas hammond, better known as one of julie andrew's children on the all-time movie classic "the sound of music" was spider-man during the dialogue scenes. hammond's spider-man also had his own secret identity as peter parker, similar to christopher reeve- superman/ clark kent, adam west-batman/bruce wayne, and of course lynda carter as wonder woman/ diana prince.it's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of 1977, the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night. in all fairness, cbs should release this pilot episode as well as "the deadly dust", the "captive tower" etc. on dvd shortly. "spider-man" was short lived, but did have a cult following, and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguire.cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. (a) there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren't born when the series originally aired in the 1970's. (b) one of the early "spider-man" episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center, which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air, in 1993, and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost.however i don't think that it would be in bad taste to release this "spider-man" episode even if the show was adventure, derived from a comic book, and camp in nature. the live action "amazing spider-man" doesn't have a large following but it has a cult following. if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. i like to follow the news, but i also like science fiction/fantasy. therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of "the amazing spider-man on dvd".

continuing with the exclusive film programme about complicated relationships in some european courts, last night in the schloss theatre was shown "anna boleyn", a film directed by the great teutonic film director herr ernst lubitsch. the film depicts the terrible story of the queen consort of the british king henry viii. she was executed by her husband ( well, not exactly, the king ordered the executioners to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event, the english reformation.the film stars dame henny porten, germany's first screen superstar during those early years and herr emil jannings, germany's fattest actor in that silent era. both play their characters in a suitable way; dame porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and herr jannings as the unscrupulous, whimsical and womanizing british monarch, a character very suitable for this german actor who overacts appropriately, given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself.in the early film period herr lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with big budgets ( "anna boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this german count ) taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in westminster abbey scene which employed 4.000 extras ( idle germans of that time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when german president friedrich ebert visited the set during filming).besides the spectacle, one of the most important aspect of this and every film of herr lubitsch, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. we experience a game of different interests, double meanings, and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy. the importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between henry viii and anna boleyn.and now, if you'll allow me, i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesn't lose her head for this teutonic aristocrat.herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/

nothing dull about this movie, which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them. even the hooded torturers have body language. jannings' performance is brilliant, all will, want and need. a henry viii as he must have been. henny porten is, maybe, nobler and purer than anne boleyn, but she plays the part as written: a victim caught in the jaws of a big (huge) baby.sparkuhl's cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration, the tints sensuous. lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest of meannesses. he takes his time, which can try the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action, but the time is worth spending. slow your heartbeat and watch this minor miracle of german silent film.

silent historical drama based on the story of anne boleyn, newly arrived lady-in-waiting to the queen who catches the lustful eye of henry viii, bad-tempered king of england who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court jester, watch jousts, and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle. well, he's soon annulled his marriage, married anne, and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir. she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady-in-waiting. meanwhile, anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant, perturbed, or downright ready to burst into tears. she just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!).this film is a solid piece of entertainment, with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours - plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print. emil jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-done portrayal of king henry the eighth - he really seemed like he was henry the eighth. i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne, seemed a bit over the top. the dvd of this film features an appropriate, nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story. quite a good film.

this is a truly wonderful love story. i liked the songs, however even if you do not, you have to love the story. peter o'toole is at his best and petula clark is doing fine as well. i first saw this when i was about 13 and loved it then. now in my forties, i still enjoy it, probably even more. still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. it is a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself as it is a chick flick. but whats wrong with that. need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie.

30 years after the original film, "goodbye, mr. chips" was made over as a musical. peter o'toole and petula clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher, chippington, who is referred to as chips by his beloved wife.o'toole was excellent here and received another oscar nomination. you have to wonder what peter o'toole has to do to win an oscar. he has lost the coveted award 8 times now. you also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to john wayne for "true grit," which was really a testament to mr. wayne's long career and popularity. this year was also marked by great performances by richard burton, "anne of the thousand days," as well as dustin hoffman and jon voight for "midnight cowboy."surprised to see petula clarke cast as mrs. chippington. however, as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well.who can forget the scene when chips carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing. he never got to tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion.the beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience.

peter o'toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. i have seen the original version with robert donat and i much prefer peter o'toole's performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical. i've really never seen anything that mr. o'toole is in that i don't like. he is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. petula clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. it is an all-around heartwarming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. i will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where mr. chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, "of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys." thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion.

great story, great music. a heartwarming love story that's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to. too bad there is no soundtrack cd.

great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic script which truly elevates the human spirit. to all those minions who toil each and every day, take heart! your patience is virtuous. your forbearance and decency will evidence, in ways you will never anticipate. this is your great story. i do not believe you can watch through to the end without a wisp of moisture in that hardened eye. or, can you? for me, it would not be so... the story is relentless! the idealist, denied his due. will anyone speak up? ah! but you will need to see the show yourselves! observe the schoolmaster in his prime, without the notice and peerage the observer would certainly expect. and why does he continue so? yes! you must watch o'toole's performance for yourselves! i can only wish it were still 'in print' to purchase, then present to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives.

"chips" is an excellent blend of music, light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter o' toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by petula clark. o' toole is able to show the shy, uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married katherine (clark). she brings him the world "what a lot of flowers" and he is forever changed. he becomes the beloved headmaster of brookfield through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through katherine's love. the songs (with the exception of the music hall number) are all "thought-songs" coming from character's emotions and thoughts and, the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "walk through the world with me" and "you and i". o'toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students (it was the reason for the oscar nomination). as a teacher, we question what "book" learning ever gets through - but, as chips says, we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts. beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "did i fill the world with love?" the boys sing their school song. by the end, chips realizes he was able to do it - but only cause catherine was there.

i admit i go more for the traditional vampire tale, but this one is a real winner. lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. there was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. a good one for all us vampire lovers.

it seems to me that a lot of people don't know that blade is actually a superhero movie on par with x-men, daredevil, punisher and the likes. what all these heroes (and in the case of x-men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of marvel. blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. so boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the marvel universe. at least until he was reinvented.david goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. he can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to stephen norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. the blade character (wesley snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with batman like darkness. snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. he is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). kris kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. n'bushe wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. donal logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. german, udo kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing dracula. stephen dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as deacon frost stands as one of the best screen villains i have perhaps ever seen.the story is good and, i feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since robert rodrigues' from dusk till dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. by saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. far from it. a lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. including the effects which are pretty good for their time. i found the vampire "dustings" to be a very nice touch. in stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. the fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.as previously stated norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following blade movies. del toro is nearly as skilled but i prefer norrington's style. his style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. a very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.all in all blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.7/10

wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. he has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. since he teamed up with whistler (kris kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord deacon frost (stephen dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.this movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish. packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue, blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely delivers.8/10

if you like horror or action watch this film asap. if the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. great action, excellent casting and top one-liners. this is the only film i have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop, kick & punch thrown. not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10

blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and wesley snipes delivers what i would say to be his best performance yet.this film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, wesley snipes fighting movement is fantastic.this film is in my opinion a must see, wesley snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and i can't wait for the sequel 'blade 2' being released next year.my imdb rating - 9 out of 10

now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. it take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc.), and turns it into something that feels brand new. in what could have easily been merely a combination of "mortal kombat" and "buffy: the vampire slayer," wesley snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of "passenger 57") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker. he acknowledges the internal conflict, but doesn't dwell on it more than necessary. he makes blade as deep a character as michael keaton made batman.i'll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy. on the other hand, you sort of have to have that in a movie like this, so it's easily excusable.well, snipes is good. and steven dorff, hyped in the previews, makes a more than bad enough bad guy to snipes' hero. he's got class, presence, and enough control in his little pinky to teach al pacino how to tone it down a bit. who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor? i sincerely hope this is. and whoa! where the heck did kris kristofferson get acting talent? don't get me wrong, but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since "millennium," and how many of us watched that just 'cause of the cool video box? well, here he is, folks, in a very obi-wanish turn, as blade's mentor and father figure. and good job, too.the quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects. accompanied by a pulsing techno beat, the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of mortal kombat. hey! it had a script, too! i was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there.the two major indications to me that i saw a quality flick were these; i had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in, a la any schumacher "batman," "the avengers," "mk: annihilation," "godzilla," or "armageddon." (wow, how many of those came out this year? ugh) also, i look forward to the inevitable sequel, as per the film's ending. let's just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one.

i didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because i was doubtful about comic flicks. ever since the "batman" series, "spawn," "judge dredd," and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, i dodged everything at all cost. i would question in my mind, "why can't someone make a movie that is rated r and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?" and finally my prayers have been answered with blade. this movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. but not blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. blade ii is cool, but not as cool as the first. blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks i've seen in a long time.

i must confess that i've been a huge fan of the almighty david "the hoff" hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80's tv series "knight rider." whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy "revenge of the cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci-fi gem "starcrash," the hoff has proved time and time again that he's a simply terrific (and shamefully underrated) actor supreme. the hoff excels here as gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend leslie (attractive brunette leslie cummings) investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of massachussetts. they're doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotel's last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. a bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel. pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious lady in black (an effectively eerie hildegard knef).granted, the rest of the cast gives the hoff a run for his money: the ever-perky linda blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed (natch!), legendary jazz singer annie ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat (poor annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and she's hung upside down in a chimney), and gorgeous blonde catherine hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut. fabrizio laurenti's competent direction, a suitably creepy atmosphere, gianlorenzo battaglia's slick, glossy cinematography (the fluid prowling steadicam tracking shots are especially nice), the gaudy special effects, carlo maria cordio and randy miller's spirited shuddery'n'spooky score, and the gory, sadistic violence are all up to par. but ultimately it's the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky italian horror cheese such a winner: he takes his shirt off once (hubba hubba!), gets sprayed with blood, and -- warning: major *spoiler* ahead -- even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end. produced by none other than joe d'amato, this picture overall rates as good, sleazy fun.

*please note: (the below text is taken from the irish dvd release). some of this summary may be wrong:edge-of-your-seat chiller, in which the legacy of an ancient witch and her bloodthirsty coven causes a deserted island hotel to become the embodiment of evil two centuries later.when an inquisitive photographer (david hasselhoff, baywatch, knight rider) and his virginal fiancée (linda blair, the exorcist) creep onto the island to research its gruesome history, they are joined by an unwit- ting estate agent and his prospective buyers.gradually the group find themselves falling victim to the ancient evil that lives on in the mysterious old woman who roams the hotel, seeking fresh victims for satanic rites, human sacrifice and demon- ic possession...check in at the witchcraft hotel... we hope you enjoy your slay!additional info. on the movies contents:violence: some gruesome, sexual violence - very strong!sex and/or nudity: some strong, as well as innuendo.bad language: some, strong.other: some drug use and references.

"witchery" is a decent little euro-trash horror yarn! david hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly, he's one of the better actors. linda blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! the plot of this film is ridiculous too. it's got some holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout.the gore in "witchery" is freaking outstanding. i loved the part where the old bag gets "sucked" into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast! and the part where the lady "gets taken advantage of" by the devil was pretty damned disturbing. i'd say this one is a must for gorehounds.if you're looking for an overproduced, well-acted flick, look elsewhere. but if you like old-school style italian sleaze and over the top gore, "witchery" belongs on your shelf.i'm surprised by the low rating on here! what were you people expecting, "the exorcist?" 7 out of 10, kids.

linda blair has been acting for forty years now, and while she will never escape the part of regan macneil in "the exorcist", few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as "witchery" does. she plays jane brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase. they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (catherine hickland and rick farnsworth) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (david hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (leslie cumming) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (hildegard knef). it seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide, and she was with child at the time. unaware of the danger, jane has recently dreamt of the witch's dramatic death, and jane's little brother tommy (michael manchester) has been more directly visited by her spooky, black-clad spirit, which he calls 'the lady in black'. the group's time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them, however, the lady in black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (george stevens). before long, the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror. she plans to avenge her own fate by possessing jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and the blood of a virgin. as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, she haunts them one by one in gruesome, horrifying ways. the island location is effectively scary, and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. it's such a colorful film that it reminds me of dario argento's work. the lighting is excellent, and the set decoration is perfectly spooky. the soundtrack is very effective and unique. the horror effects are extreme, terrifying, and unforgettable. the cinematography is great, and it is this that brings us back to linda blair. the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins, lingering close-ups that subtly detail jane's incremental possession, and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films. there are hidden homages to "rosemary's baby", "jacob's ladder", "the shining", "black sunday", and of course "the exorcist". she does a great job, and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance. that isn't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; catherine hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as jane's bitchy mother rose. hasselhoff gives it his best, but he is not essentially a film star, and his television persona gets in the way of his performance. blair and young michael manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. the film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (blair also played a mother in 2003's "monster makers", and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them). lastly, hildegard knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. along with blair, she was also perfectly cast. but it's blair's movie all the way. jane brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film hearkens back to "exorcist ii: the heretic". i think "witchery" is up there with "the exorcist", "exorcist ii", "hell night", and "summer of fear" as blair's best genre work to date.

witchery, or witchcraft as it's commonly known in europe, beings with jane brooks (linda blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch. jane's mother & father rose (annie ross) & freddie (robert champagne) are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from boston, renovating it & reopening it. together with jane & their young son tommy (michael manchester) rose & freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named linda sullivan (catherine hickland) to check on the amount of work that needs doing, they also meet up with the estate agent jerry giordano (rick farnsworth) & hire a local fisherman named sam (george stevens) to take them to the island. once there they enter the hotel & begin to inspect the property while back on the boat sam is killed & the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance. they discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named gary (david hasselhoff) & his virgin fiancé leslie (leslie cumming) who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends & superstitions surrounding the infamous island & hotel. as the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious 'lady in black' (hildegard knef) keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession, human sacrifice & satanic rites...the director of this american italian co-produced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the imdb lists fabrizio laurenti as martin newlin but there are rumours that joe d'amato did the honours, either way to be honest despite it's bad reputation i found witchery quite entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good cheesy sort of way. the script credited to harry spalding & daniele stroppa on the imdb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is daniel davis, anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job, please stop laughing. at heart it's a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths & a surreal feeling to everything. the different sets of characters have reasonable motives & didn't get on my nerves as much as i'd thought they might, it's not plotted very well, it doesn't make a whole a lot of sense & the dialogue isn't exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole witchery entertained me for it's 95 odd minute duration plain & simple. it's reasonably well paced, a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal, bizarre goings-on & gruesome deaths to keep one amused. one part of witchery which destroys some of it's credibility is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight & the sea is probably calm enough to swim in, witchery's supposed 'twist' ending didn't really work for me either & just check out the dumb expression on cummings face on that final freeze-frame. the hotel provides for a good isolated location & adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable 'horror' feel throughout, cheap horror at that. technically witchery is not too bad at all, it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout & while not exactly the pinnacle of film-making finesse it's overall production values are slightly better than expected. the violence & gore is of typical euro explicitness, a woman has her lips sewn shut & hung inside a fireplace so she can't scream as the others light it, someone is crucified & then burned alive, impaled on a swordfish, someones veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man with no lips. witchery was shot in english so there is no dubbing, as far as acting goes david hasselhoff & linda blair in the same film what more can i say?! yes ladies hasselhoff does take his shirt off & for the lads cummings takes hers off. both hasselhoff & blair are a hoot to watch in this thing, however the little kid is very annoying & really can't act at all. i sure most sane film-goers will disagree with my opinions but i still stand by the fact that i liked it & would happily watch it again, witchery is pretty good fun & definitely worth a watch if your into 'bad' films or your a horror fan in general.

i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual "horror" movie again. i had been disappointed with her in most everything since the "exorcist "movies (which i loved). what was up with all of those nasty "b-movies" she did? david hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. he is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. david needs to stick to "knight rider" or "baywatch".all around, this is an awesome movie. even for the eighties, this was an awesome film. it has horror, action, and drama. it is a suspenseful, and i loved the way linda blair turned out.

during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it. something like: "is killinggänget now taking off nazism?"so, my comprehension of this movie, was from the beginning to get a notion of nazism. when recently seeing this movie in the tv-version i had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this.strangely enough i haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since i first heard it.these are the things i found in "four shades of brown". in all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:1. the crematory-worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them. in the crematory-room in dealing with death and fire it's almost like a cheerful game to him. the seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly, in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severely.possible lesson: the importance of showing the young adequate emotions. when they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good.2.the magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand, reaching for personality, integrity and joy, he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair.their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste in opposite to his parents "bad" taste. the real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him: his fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environment.possible lesson: oppression breeds bondage.3.the father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance. he robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance.possible lesson: when no love given you cannot give any.4.the fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression. here the ice cold nazi-sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence. it gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young "scin-head"-nazists behavior when oppressing others. possible lesson? : can nazism take birth in a pervert home?can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life, in the long run, be that room is given to sadistic nazism ?very seldom does a movie contains so much. it reveals little by little as i meditate on it. i consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are superb. especially the nice-seeming bloke played by ulf brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all..

this movie must be exported to the rest of the world! an absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in sweden. the one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career. i would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended. also the unique pause in the middle is something i've never seen before.can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended dvd. apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3,5 hours.

i didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) swedish comedy & satire team, as they released their first feature film. more broad satire? well, we do get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable tales of family pains, generation gaps and fatherhood, in particular. but it's drama, thankfully, and what drama! epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully picked, geographically different parts of sweden. but each story could seriously carry a whole movie, if expanded separately.it's dark, twisted, harrowing, yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed. script, acting and cinematography are absolute world class, as three hours seem to get by in a blink! it's four shades of mastery, and easily one of the best films in the nations' cinema history. it's sweden's answer to "short cuts" or "magnolia", if you like, and instantly on par with those!9 out of 10 from ozjeppe

never, ever, have i been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people, that faces a crisis, or many. in some ways a little like short cuts, but totally different, at the same time.there are a heap of lead characters, whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as persons show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter.the closest equivalent in a us movie, i can think of, which then is far weaker in every respect, is the royal tenenbaums. four shades of brown, as the title would be in english, tells the story about a stressed out hotelier and his wife, and his elderly parents (who are traveling magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematory and his family misadventures; about the members of a cooking course (who mostly talk about their sorry lives) and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey, who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave, by singing and appearing in 3d during the funeral, thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune (the family gets nil, not even the famous horse is given to the family)!there is a warmth and compassion in this film, that is filled with grief and laughter, that i've never experienced before.most actors were new to me, except robert gustafsson and one or two more, but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the swedish guldbagge extravaganza (= the swedish "oscar" awards) a week ago!male, female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film, plus a few more, to boot!if you have the chance, go and see it - the hours float by very quickly!

as a veteran screen writing instructor at richland college in dallas and a former mgm screenwriter back in the days of decent films, i am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on channel 33 in dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which betty white is gorgeous and makes one yearn for the good old days of truly good movies before hollywood started banging out all this crap for the teenagers. if a producer is listening, i'd like to state that there are enough of us over 60's who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns, no killing, no special effects, no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling, as this film did for me.

florence vidor stars as the daughter of a strict bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip taints her name. in the big city, she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two had secretly married) and raises their child on her own. years later, she goes back home to confront her family.this old melodrama is heavily larded with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but sounding remarkably modern). some of it is laid on with a trowel (as the father, theodore roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but it's well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer henry sharp.

vidor shines as judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. her brother, david, is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes, rather than asking dad to do it for him.other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so i won't rehash it; i will, however, point out that nan, who is pregnant by david, is also married to him. this is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards. the two are secretly married, but nan's father, having been paid by david's father, tears up their marriage certificate.nan's death scene, with judith in attendance, is a truly heart-rending experience, and highly charged with emotion. this scene alone is worth watching the movie for, but there's far more to the plot than that; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story?

"hail the woman" is one of the most moving films i have ever seen in my entire life. i watched it twice in a row and sobbed my eyes out.this silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience; unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won't watch it all the way through, and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough. this film could use a digital restoration, to help bring out its beauty, but i doubt it will get it from anyone, since its main theme is spiritual restoration before christ of the family unit, and this is not politically correct these days. however it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships.the cast is magnificent, especially florence vidor, who literally glows as judith, the daughter; ethereal madge bellamy as nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside; theodore roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride; and handsome lloyd hughes, as the son david, afraid of his father, but really of life itself. this is a nice film to watch at christmas, especially. you will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.

i'm impressed that 'hail the woman' was made at all; released just one year after american women got the vote, this turgid drama makes an earnest plea against the sexual double standard which judges women's sexual behaviour more harshly than men's.slight spoilers ahead. a prologue, set in the plymouth colony in 1621, shows a pilgrim girl sentenced to the ducking stool for flirting with a boy; the boy is not penalised. now we come to flint hill, new hampshire in the present (1921). oliver beresford (theodore roberts) is a bombastic bible-thumper: what we call in britain and australia 'a god-botherer'. beresford is determined that his son david (lloyd hughes) become a preacher, regardless of how david feels about it. as for beresford's daughter judith ... well, beresford is confident that women aren't important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers. apparently, god told him this personally.david's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates nan higgins, the stepdaughter of the local odd-jobs man. (tully marshall's character is identified in the credits solely as the 'odd jobs man', but a close-up of a cheque reveals his name to be jake higgins. the prejudices of 1921 require that he be merely nan's stepfather, not her biological parent.) to save his son from scandal, beresford buys off nan's stepfather with a cheque. nan goes off to the big city, to melt into oblivion as one more unwed mother.judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed upon her by her gender. (or rather, by other people's perceptions of it.) she meets wyndham gray (excellent performance by edward martindel), an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes. but judith is informally engaged to local lout joe hurd, who won't put up with such nonsense. hurd is played by vernon dent, a burly performer now remembered solely for comedy roles (as a second banana to harry langdon, and as a villain in three stooges movies). he gives an excellent performance here, in a role outside his usual range. sadly, in real life dent spent his final years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy.eventually, judith ends up working at an orphanage. this being 1921, i expected the orphanage to be whites-only, so i was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one chinese boy. (and unpleasantly surprised when he's used as the butt for a racial joke.) the movie makes one odd error here. in a christmas sequence, we see the orphanage mistress reciting 'a visit from saint nicholas' ... but (in a dialogue title) she credits santa claus with six reindeer rather than eight. this is followed by a brief animation sequence, showing santa with six reindeer hitched to his sleigh. i assume that the animators (either by accident, or to save money) left out two reindeer, and the title card revised the poem to match the error.lloyd hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor. his most famous performance is his role in 'the lost world', where he's easily upstaged by a rampaging brontosaurus. for his climactic scene in 'hail the woman', hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. in his performance as the gospel-shouting father, theodore roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature. i disagree: sadly, decades after this film was made, i continue to encounter 'holy' fools exactly like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them, and firmly convinced they have god's authority to do so.in the central role of judith beresford, florence vidor gives a sensitive, realistic and intelligent performance. i normally dislike vidor, who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them. here, her character's physical appearance is less relevant than usual.this entire film is impressively directed by john griffith wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. sadly, wray died at the onset of the talkies era, in his mid-thirties: had he lived another ten years, he would surely have helmed several early sound classics. in 'hail the woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions: i was especially impressed by a scene in the new england forest, when vidor and dent have a quarrel in front of an enormous uprooted tree. (i wonder where this was actually filmed.) 'hail the woman' deals with unpleasant subject matter, but it deserves to be much better known, and i'll rate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.

this movie is about london and it's an amazing movie. it will be released on dvd in april 2003 and i will buy it when it gets out so if you have not seen it until then buy it. the music in the movie is even better (saint etienne) have done the soundtrack.

i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. it has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it (in all the 3 schneider movies) without a doubt. several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on schneider's way of seeing things. by the way, helge schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the jazz-musicions in germany (maybe europe). he is mostly inspired by the great m.davis and t.monk. so if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of h.schneider you would have to "surrender".

helges best movie by far. very funny, very surrealistic. if bunuel made a movie starring buster keaton as krusty the clown it would look like this.brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other schneider movies, especially helmut körschgen as the sidekick of 00schneider. (andreas kunze who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though). and of course helge himself as nihil baxter is absolutely incredible.p.s: if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that "holz ist" painting.

the phenomenon helge schneider defies easy description or quick categorization. yet, for the international audience not acquainted to him, one could say he's something like a crude mix of weird al yankovich and andy kaufman, adding a foible for jazz music and 70s outfits. while his stage performances already are eccentric, his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous."00 schneider" is, in my opinion, helge's best movie. he stars in the two leading roles - police detective "kommissar 00 schneider" and murderer-villain "nihil baxter", and also in a precious smaller role as physician "dr. hasenbein".in the opening scene, we see how modern-art-loving baxter accidentally kills the circus clown bratislav metulskie, from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used jaguar, when a beloved sculpture slips out of baxter's hands, fatally hitting metulskie. upon reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick, lt. koerschgen, who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name. they pick up baxter's track quickly, and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion (one of the movie's best scenes!), but initially fail to gather any proof. the story winds through many turns, with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny, such as a daydream by 00 (including the most unusual view on a running man's brief-clad crotch in movie history), a police-department party during which koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized, and a visit at the already mentioned dr. hasenbein's. baxter, then, is finally caught attempting to escape to rio de janeiro on a plane.always worth special mention is andreas kunze who in this case plays 00's wife, as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in helge's movies.so all you folks out there looking for new laughs, i strongly recommend this movie. the catch? you have to understand german (as i doubt there's an english version around)...

the answer.....no, sadly not. though miller and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treat.the drama, suspense,romance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of 1898. a enlightening experience, one for all the family!

this is a bewildering, absurdist short. a miller, dressed in white, makes his way towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. although the image is pared down, there is an obvious logic here. however, he is stopped by the sweep, all in black because of his work. they start pummelling each other for no particular reason - did the snooty miller insult the sooty sweep? is this class war? whatever, he pelts his adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight, making redundant everything he had done prior to the fight, making redundant the windmill, so that all becomes as pointless as the fight. the miller's grain whitens the sweep's blackness - later westerns wouldn't be so subtle, heroes and villains being colour-coded. is there a racial tint here? if this wasn't marvellous enough, the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately kafkaesque ending to an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema. this mix of comedy, surrealism, and the absurd is an obvious forerunner for buster keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, hitchcock's 'foreign correspondant'.

being a fan of saint etienne and the city of london, i was very excited to see this movie on the list of the vancouver international film festival. this movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' london.the movie is held completely in 'dark' colours, which i personally don't like too much. furthermore the narration was a little too british and the comments sometimes got a little flat. other than that, there are some great comments by londoners and excellent shots. finisterre doesn't glorify london by showing all the great attractions of the city, but rather gives deep insights in what london is really like. from the east end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the 'special little retreats' for londoners.all in all:+great soundtrack +nice shots +great insights-narration -tiering to watch at times -very dark pictureworth watching! i give it a 7/10

i absolutely loved this movie! since i don't want to give much away, it's basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. it's very heartwarming story, between the struggles they have. i also think natalie and susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film! this is definitely worth seeing! two thumbs up, way up!

i just saw this movie tonight. coming into it i thought it would be good because i like natalie portman alot and susan sarandon is a great actor too, but it was way better than i could have imagined. you come out of the movie feeling great. the acting was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by lately. natalie portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at nyu, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor. anyways, back on subject, the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and i definitely think that everyone should go see it. i would give more details, but i don't want to give away the movie.

i just came back from seeing this awesome movie!! i can relate to it so much...it reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place, and my mom acts like adele august! boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes. one of the best real-life movies i've ever seen!! and natalie portman rules!! 10/10

i'm sorry, but "star wars episode 1" did not do any justice to natalie portman's talent (and undeniable cuteness). she was entirely underused as queen amidala, and when she was used, her makeup was frighteningly terrible. for "anywhere but here," she sheds her god-awful makeup and she acts normally. and not only can she act good, she looks good doing it. i'm a bit older than she (she's only 18), and i have little or no chance of meeting her, but hey, a guy is allowed to dream, right?even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie, the film belongs entirely to portman. i've been a watcher of portman's since "beautiful girls" (where she was younger, but just as cute). there's big things for her in the future - i can see it.

adam sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie. the matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie. anywhere but here is my favorite drama.perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.susan sarandon is absolutely amazing. by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself. she did a simply amazing job.natalie portman also did a great job. i recently rented her first movie, leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl. i believe that she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress. well, 5 years later she is still just as good an actress. in fact, she's much better.not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well, but they also worked perfectly together. i mean, even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie.this movie is about a 14 year old girl (portman) and her restless mother (sarandon) that leave their home town in wisconsin for beverly hills.at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years (usually down, might i add).although this explanation is a little vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak, for it is actually very deep. what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly, but then they focus in on it to make it strong.and it is very strong, but also the plot sequencing is great. and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as "classic".i loved this movie. i laughed. i cried. and although, admittedly, there are a few loopholes, it's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end.

being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! i related to the character ann august more than most would. my mother isnt as eccentric as adele, but the feelings of lonliness is the same. this movie is perfect in the ating aspects, and natalie's, and susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years. their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! i would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away. because there is genually alot of people out there who would wish to be "anywhere but here" including me! and if you can, see this movie with your best friend or your mother. its the tears that blend everyone around you together more!!

its the best movie i have seen in 2000, it has the beautiful and talented natalie portman in it. it has a great storyline, cast and soundtrack. i enjoyed it very much. 10 out of 10

since i am a fan of natalie portman, i had to see the movie. i enjoyed every minute of it. it plays out in a very sincere way. throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother. susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some-guy (he's in outside providence) but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. and i think that is great. i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film.natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i haven't seen her in a bad film yet. so, any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by me.a good film. 7/10

most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by natalie portman and susan sarandon. natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in america and one worthy of a golden globe nomination. the control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene. susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalism.any natalie fan would've seen the film based on her past successes, but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film. it is a truly humbling experience.

i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy - stereotyped characters over-acting their way through a cops and robbers farce. but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest. michelle pfeiffer is adorable, but the person really carrying the film is dean stockwell, who steals every scene as the head mobster (named tony, no less). stockwell's performance is the reason i'm writing this review (and the only reason i'd recommend it), in fact. you'll be tickled by his screen time. he's plays the mob boss perfectly, with comedic touches in the right places, managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche. in fact, stockwell's a complete delight to watch - a master of the 'double take,' and a real 'looker' in those classy suits and fedoras. meesa says: a good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers.

what happened to ava gardner in the 1940s and marilyn monroe in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress michelle pfeiffer in the '80s: her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. anyone looking for validation of pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's "frankie and johnny" or '92's "love field" (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be, when given the right part, should check out 1988's "married to the mob." in this one, she plays angela demarco, the widow of a recently "iced" mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky long island home to start a new life for herself and her son, while being pursued by mob boss dean stockwell and fbi man matthew modine. while this movie has lots going for it (a very amusing script; offbeat characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director jonathan demme's previous effort "something wild"; and hilarious yet menacing performances by stockwell and mercedes ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), michelle steals the show easily. notice how perfectly she nails angela's undereducated, long island italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. once upon a time, long ago, oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. had this film been made 60 years ago, michelle mighta been a contenduh...

first, don't be fooled by my family name. my mother was full blooded italian, so i really know italian families, and i love mobster movies, even the funny ones like this.for those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is. this is a damn funny and well-styled film. the fact that almost nobody is italian in it is part of the joke, so far as i can see. and what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of michelle pfieffer? puh-lease! when i saw this film it won me over with the opening song by rosemary clooney who was as irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of the italian words in "mambo italiano" is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (hell, i even bought the record the next day because of it.) just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that i have personally seen in my relatives houses, though not in the same place (which i found hysterical) sold it for me.this movie is like goodfellas on laughing gas. i just wonder why there are no burger worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? my guess is the crew ate it. "the fries are crispy. the shakes are creamy." my mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous ms. pfieffer. (and i never trusted clowns anyway.) and the three best things about this film are mercedes ruehl's achingly funny mob wife spurned, dean stockwell as her philandering husband tony "the tiger" and last, but definitely not least, the great mugging by oliver platt who should get more comic roles. and note to myself: find out where that black chick went. ouch! why does she work so infrequently? this picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.

michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy. alec baldwin, who was an up and coming star when the film was made, is a hoot. dean stockwell, in a sendup of john gotti, is hysterical. but mercedes ruehl, as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie.jonathan demme, previously known for wacky comedies like "something wild" and "melvin and howard"-proves once again that he is a genius. i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing "silence of the lambs." the performances he evokes from his actors in "married" are inspired, and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.one of the cutest, most endearing films of the 80's, it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.

this is a fun movie with subtle intention. its off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. the soundtrack is perfect.i own this on vhs and i have watched it many, many times, because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals (though using joan cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent. i know, i know, she was still young...).on a sad note, i decided to check out the dvd last night (instead of watching my vhs tape), and was shocked to find many crucial scenes cut. and on the copy i watched, there was no special feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed!! i am so glad i bought the used vhs at a flea market.it is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this, which is another reason i love it so much. it takes great skill, talent, and genius to move around the scenes like mercedes ruehl, dean stockwell, and matthew modine do from scene to scene (note the scene when the grocery carts converge, the rolling on the floor during the shoot-out in miami, the chicken lickin' debacle, the foot massage, the salon hair-washing.) there is a very "theatrical" feel to this film, which may be the turn-off for so many whose poor reviews follow: i know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and over-the-top performances for poor acting and worse direction. not so. jonathan demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.the opening credits and first scene rank among my all-time favorites, as well (another favorite opening credits/first scene: fly away home).too bad matthew modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye; i really like him, and found his casting perfect in the role of mike smith. actually, this film is well-cast from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to his role. as for the question of expecting audience to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians - why not? i thought they pulled it off perfectly well.charming, fun, exciting... what is there not to like? if you want a little fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventure-mob-love story. if you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families, tune to hbo's the sopranos.

this is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an overdecorated castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince. she does find her prince, but he's not that handsome. instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk-up in manhattan.pfeifer, stockwell and ruehl lead a cast of fully realized, if a little over-the-top, characters. demme reaches the highest level of movie-making in my mind. he creates a world i want to move into - a manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community.i wish imdb linked to reviewers' other comments. i'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate. i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to "live" at least for an hour or so.

time does extraordinary things. it's the ultimate judge. time has granted "married to the mob" an extra doses of freshness. there aren't any dead moments or cheap shots. it's more of a delight now than it ever was. michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it's as far away from a caricature as anything she's ever done. a true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique. the legendary dean stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it's just as menacingly real as he is hilarious. and matthew modine? why did i think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with pfeiffer? i was wrong. they are wonderful together. they reminded me, this time, to the barbara stanwyck, fred macmurray of "remember the night" i'm writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this jonathan demme gem.

i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there. only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one. i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and can't help but notice that the main things people are criticizing are irrelevant. such as "it is very one sided" such a pathetic criticism, every where in society that you look you will see the other side, and if you still need help go to globalpublicmedia.com. "it is the same people over and over" uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "filming style is all the same, head shots with few exceptions" if you want flash and dazzle watch micheal moore if you want info watch real docs such as this one. as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained. my guess is that these people are just missing the point and don't wanna give up there suv's.my recommendation: watch it. learn from it, and continue your education about such subjects. it is very important stuff for everyone.

the end of suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming "peak" of the world's oil supply. as the world population grows, so does demand for oil and power. as we extract oil and power, we come to a "peak" in production. more oil is demanded, less oil is generated. the inevitable outcome is conflict, and major change. this film will be disturbing, and alarming if you're new to the topic. you may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim. it should be required viewing. beyond politics, beyond optimism, the math is undeniable. suburbia is the focus, because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets. while intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis, the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies. this issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think. this film is a lucid, coherent look at it.

i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am acutely aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products. i've been an avid consumer of new technology and i keep running out of space on powerboards - so i know that even the energy crunch associated with peak oil will change my life appreciably.the end of suburbia shows, in a rational and entertaining manner, just how much my whole family's lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime. i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the tab for our excesses, however the film-makers do offer a glimmer of hope in that they acknowledge human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that tends to be engendered by shared hardship.there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is baseless propaganda - or in treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in "on the beach" (i.e. with suicide pills at the ready). even with our best efforts, times will get harder all over, and i'm hoping there's enough compassion and humanity to go around.

i always knew the day was coming. we all knew. there's only so much oil in the ground, and one day we'll run short. but isn't there supposed to be enough coal to use instead? and wind power, or something. things for future generations to worry about.then this documentary hit me smack between the eyes. oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms. when the inevitable oil shortages hit, a lot of things -- air travel, many drugs, plastics, life in the suburbs -- will become impossible. but the craziest insight from the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives must change. even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange post-oil world which (the documentary claims) could be starting now.despite its gloomy message, the documentary is often highly entertaining. it contains fabulous historical footage (sober images of dark urban factories, and campy funny stuff from the 1950's) which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. it also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place.my only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now. how can this be a big emergency all of a sudden? we knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world -- and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars. if our failure to follow through on president jimmy carter's initiatives 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why was no one shouting about it on soapboxes?in the end i found the documentary highly persuasive; and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream. this is must viewing for everyone not afraid to face a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about.- charles

this documentary was my first introduction to peak oil theory. a fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. i had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. this movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the american way of life is dependent on the "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. a lot of the topics are plain common sense, and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. but you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. the interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. i don't think this film is meant to scare people. it's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.after watching this film i was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same. great documentary, everyone should see it.

first of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically. some kind of combination between "american beauty" and "as good as it gets". and of course something specifically to all russian movies ( of course the valuable one, no dirty propaganda !) : the problem of loneliness of man ... especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism ( both positive or negative propaganda ! ). a movie about common people, their problems, lack of satisfactions - especially for young ones, fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society ... and about the fake "solutions" : alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution : true love ... of course it's very well "located" in the space and time of "russian perestroika" but it's valid for all the society ( except a perfect one, but don't worry - not possible to find this on our earth !). for the last time - definitely recommended ...

this movie was groundbreaking in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene. however, the movie can be considered great for many reasons, not the least of which is its true, gritty portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a working class soviet family. i would definitely recommend it.

there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me. all in all i did enjoy this movie, but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what i was used to. for example the environment that vera's family lived in was very tense. almost every time the family was together they were either drinking, fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three. after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it. i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family. throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen. it gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film. the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fiancé sergei. this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers (after sergei locks vera's father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab sergei) that he is abusive. another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment. it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior. the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia.

little vera is the story of a russian teenager, her family, and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life sliding increasingly into decay. in her search for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious sergei, whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly spirals out of control.little vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way. the drinking of the father, the enabling and lack of understanding of the mother, the casual lies and misdirection of the brother, and vera herself forgiving them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch. however, the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters. set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay, little vera presented a vastly different view of soviet life than had ever been seen before. in fact, little vera is a portrait of the collapse of soviet society painted in shades of pain, desperation, and rust. it is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order.although painful and desperately unsatisfying, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, if only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping russia today.

a gritty presentation of the decay of family values and human dignity in the wake of soviet communism, vasili pichul's 1988 film little vera is a landmark film of modern russian cinema. pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitized idealism promoted in soviet times (as in aleksandrov's circus), brashly moving the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. a contemporary ukrainian setting further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film to its time period, second by its utilization of a locale not only struggling for identity in lieu of a soviet system, but also as a nation distinct from the russian idiom that had dominated the u.s.s.r.vera, the film's title character and protagonist, is a rebellious adolescent girl with a "dysfunctional" family including a hard-drinking father and a mother care-worn. rejecting her would-be beau andrei, vera begins a destructive (and primarily sexual) relationship with a college student named sergei. despite her parents' dislike for the lazy sergei, and despite sergei's rude contempt for her parents, he moves into their cramped apartment. tensions escalate until vera's father drunkenly stabs sergei. vera must decide if she will stay loyal to her intolerable family by testifying her father acted in self-defense, or continue to support and defend the ever-detached sergei. unbearable in almost every imaginable way, little vera masterfully captures and communicates the inescapable void left in social life after the collapse of communism. the sexual aggressiveness of the film (it was the first film to show explicit sex) combined with the unrelenting presentation of social reality (a marked distinction from the socialist realism demanded by stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of former-soviet life. most interesting, however, was public reception. while many wrote hate mail to the director and star, the film was wildly popular. here the double-edged nature of "film as social criticism" emerges: if done correctly, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. because no easy solution presents itself, some viewers will hate the film and filmmakers for "bringing up" the issue. many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this regard: larry clark's kids, harmony korine's gummo, even popular movie's such as john hughes' breakfast club. i recommend this film to those viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours excruciating domestic conflict and social miasma is not overly daunting. the film is absolutely beautiful, and incredibly challenging. despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments within it are profoundly beautiful. of course, the socio-historic and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked, and in fact operate as an even more assertive reason for watching this film.

forget every spy movie you've ever seen - this is what life was like in the ussr, and still is in many places in russia and the ex-soviet countries. vera dreams of life of leisure, as she imagines the west to be; her reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father, and the ever-present alcohol. and her prospects for the future are not much better. she finds a man and they try to patch up a life together, but he is afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery in this movie is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects; they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera.forget your stereotyped, cold russians of spy movies. this is the real deal: people are passionate, vibrant, and present in a way you'll never see in a drama from the west.

in russia, the ordinary teenager vera (natalya negoda) lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator. her brother victor (aleksandr negreba) lives in moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and vera, being always motive for arguing. when vera meets the student of university sergei (andrei sokolov), they fall in love for each other and decide to get married. sergei moves to vera's house, but lives in conflict with her father. this relationship leads the family to a tragedy.i have just seen "malenkaya vera", and i liked a lot this deep family drama. i am not familiarized with the life style in the former urss, but there are some unusual behaviors that i found very interesting. the first one, when victor tells vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. another one, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. many difficulties of vera's family and their friends, the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in third world countries. this low budget movie is very well-directed, and the story is very profound and real. the cast has great performances and the actress natalya negoda is very beautiful. in the cover of the brazilian vhs, released by sagres distributor, there is information that natalya negoda was the centerfold of playboy magazine. i am not sure how precise are the subtitles in portuguese, since many long sentences spoken in russian are limited to short translation in few words. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a pequena vera" ("the little vera")

one of the major aspects of "malenkaya vera" (called "little vera" in english) is that it was the first movie from the soviet union that featured a sex scene, albeit a short one. the title is important: vera is the russian word for "faith", identifying that punk vera (natalya negoda) has little faith in the soviet system. and as the movie shows, there's not much faith to be had in it. the opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of zhdanov, nearly a hell on earth. when vera's lover sergei (andrey sokolov) moves in with her family, it leads to some unexpected events.like in many russian movies, people's names describe their characters. for example, there's viktor (remember that "victor" means winner). all in all, this is a good look at the soviet union while it was collapsing - and we can see why it was collapsing. really good.

it is difficult, today and in the us, to understand this movie. we have nothing, really, to compare it with. here is an attempt at comparison: it is as if during the last years of saddam's rule, a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film, which, for the first time ever, showed life as it really was lived in that country. the life of ordinary young girl, with all the terror and the repression full blown. then the film was exhibited freely in iraq. if you could imagine that unlikely event, then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union. prior to this film, soviet cinema was highly censored. soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise. then suddenly this. the alcoholism, the random sex, the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city, the choking pollution, the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves, the utter hopelessness - it is all there. people were stunned. soviet women would often weep during the showings. many would say that this is the story of their lives. it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing. it undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the soviet union. reading the reviews here, i can see that few understand this film. one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex. to the soviet viewers at the time, the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema. others compare it to current films such as "as good as it gets" might as well compare homer's illiad to the latest john grissam novel. they simply do not compare. this is not just a film, this is was a social document, and a transforming social force. it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film. other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family. one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family. the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life. there was nowhere else to go, because the family down the block and in the next town were the same. this was life in the soviet union for most people. this is a film that can be viewed on many levels: as a drama it traces the landscape of despair, as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the break-up of the soviet union, and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control, and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other. little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims, despite any good intentions that system may have. in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished. it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history.

the captain and tennille have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing. unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits. the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast. i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion. i've noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information i've found on the net. i've been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd. whatever the truth may be, i'm very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company. i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format. i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included. i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren't included. hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. i recommend this dvd to any c&t fan.

this was alright. it was one of those we gotcha but we don't have enough evidence yet storylines. in the couple handfulls of movies i've seen her in, i've never really though much of stephanie zimbalist. a professional tv actress she is but nothing really outstanding. here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profiler. her character got along well with the motley bunch of special investigation unit cops she was assigned with. there wasn't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is... but when i found out i wasn't that surprised. oh well. one more thing that was good was the los angeles locations. quite possibly if this was made today they'd use toronto or vancouver but here they really shot in downtown l.a. like that a lot (even though i semi-despise l.a.) liked the movie, too. i don't know if i'd ever watch it again but it wasn't too bad. my grade: b-

i have to admit that when first saw madonna performing holiday on top of the pops many years ago i said to my wife "another american one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong!!" well she was wearing a fright wig and was appallingly dressed. i have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but i have to eat my words. i do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. this confessions tour film is great,even if the music is not(and its not). i was impressed by the staging and concepts. madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. my daughter was at the london gigs and was crazy about it. the lady (madge) has proved my initial assessment of her so very wrong!!

this show was so exhausting to watch and there's only two numbers drowned world (substitute for love) and paradise (not for me) were you can sit down and just contemplate it all. the opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling, as madonna enters the stage via a gigantic swarovski crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses galloping. horses play a role in this show due to madonna falling off one. the infamous scene of madonna on the crucifix is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million, the number of how many african children are orphaned due to aids. at the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in donating. we then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. there's an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of i love new york and ray of light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements. towards the end there's the music number with the song disco inferno mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known. the ending again is full of energy as the show wraps up to the tunes of lucky star and hung up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end the message "have you confessed?" comes up. the dvd is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus. jonas akerlund did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.

madonna has been rocking the boat for over 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience -obviously- and a lot of knowledge. she was never the one to think about yesterday, au contraire, she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow. she bravely takes all the new trends, technologies, and incorporates them into her own acts. her world tours have never been 'average'. when madonna performs, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. she takes inspirations from east, west, and makes then unique. everything is given a deeper meaning, and the confessions tour is not different. from the very beginning, you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. she starts with bang, then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain you. she remakes her own songs, giving them a modern feel. she sings on a disco cross, she almost comes in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you bargained for. it's a spectacle, an audio-visual orgasm that cannot be put in words. lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing madonna on stage. pushing fifty, she is still in an incredible form. recent sticky and sweet tour is even more ground-breaking, which proves nothing else, that madonna was, is, and ever be the one and the only queen of pop.

the show was amazing and very professional. madonna is a non-stop, dancing and singing for 2 hours. the opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jump was a really good performance. the entire show was full of energy so it's kind of hard to say which were the highlights because every song had something special and unique. i saw live couple of her previous tours (drowned world and reinvention tour)they were good but you can't compare with this one. the dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. madonna still looks very good. if you haven't seen it yet, i highly recommend you to see it. you'll enjoy the show from the beginning to the end. madonna is still the dancing queen.

this concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so, madonna's confessions on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career. she's 48 and she looks simply divine, she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior. i am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because she actually sounds better live. each song was so unique, the visuals where stunning. the performance of 'live to tell' was fantastic and had me awestruck, 'isaac' was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism, the arabic horn, the american eagle set free. i particularly liked the rockin performance of 'i love new york', i almost stood up in my lounge room and cheered when she told her critics to suck george bushes ****. and then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). this spectacular decedent concert made a fan out of me.verdict: highly recommended with a capital h.

well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia,pa sometime in june of 06.and i really loved it.my all time favorite madonna look was the 1990 blond ambition tour era.this to me is "madonna".now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit motherhood.and i totally agree.this is a classic madonna concert.i wish "live to tell" wasn't edited.we saw body's falling from buildings on 911,we can see a woman on a cross...any way i'm looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage.she is a artist of all time.the best out there...and still at the top and going strong.long live madonna !

this is a spectacular production! i have seen the show live twice in chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that i was able to perceive only fragments of what was going on. the stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located. as always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! the footage was masterfully edited, one of the best concert dvds of all times in my opinion! i only hope and wish that they will release this on blu-ray of hd-dvd so that we can re-live this extravaganza over and over again.

years ago, with "ray of light," madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry, and since then she's occasionally transcended even her own standards. this concert production, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects, and trance-inducing arrangements, blows away all previous efforts. madonna's apparent ambition -- to single-handedly bring about world peace through music and dance -- may seem hubristic or absurd to some. but hell, somebody's got to do it! thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "confessions tour live from london" places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.

hammer house of horror: witching time is set in rural england on woodstock farm where stressed musician david winter (jon finch) lives with his actress wife mary (prunella gee) & is currently composing the music for a horror film. one night while looking for his dog billy david finds a mysterious woman in his barn, calling herself lucinda jessop (patricia quinn) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now. obviously rather sceptical david has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor charles (ian mcculloch) to come examine her, however once he arrives & they enter the room lucinda has disappeared. charles puts it down to david drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to david & mary...witching time was episode 1 from the short lived british anthology horror series produced by hammer studios for tv & originally aired here in the uk during september 1980, the first of two hammer house of horror episodes to be directed by don leaver (episode 13 the mark of satan being the other) i actually rather liked this. as a series hammer house of horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly watching time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch, the script by anthony read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace. the character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & i liked the way it never quite reveals whether david & mary are going crazy or not. i think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed tv show that i enjoyed more than i thought i would.being made for british tv meant the boys at hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know frankenstein & dracula films although the contemporary english setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. another tv based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although i didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good. it's well made for what it is & hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite ian mcculloch making a bit-part appearance.witching time is a good start to the hammer house of horror series, as a 50 minute piece of british tv it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore?

as a great fan of the hammer studios and enthusiastic watcher of their gothic horror films, i wonder what took me so long to start watching their tv-series "hammer house of horror", which only ran for one season in 1980. now that i've seen the first four episodes of the show, i can say that it easily satisfies my expectations so far. while this first episode "witching time" is maybe not the most imaginative horror story ever told, and doesn't quite deliver the marvelous gothic atmosphere that i love hammer's films from the 50s to the 70s for, it doubtlessly does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes. film score composer david winter (jon finch) is tormented by the 17th century witch lucinda (patricia quinn)... while he story may be simple, but for a running time of less than an hour, it is effective and delivers many creepy moments. northern irish actress patricia quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "the rocky horror picture show" (1975) as well as the fantastic monty python comedy "monty python's meaning of life" (1983), is wonderfully malicious in her role which fits her like a glove. jon finch is also quite good as david, and while prunella gee, who plays his adulterous actress wife, may not be the best actress ever, she is definitely nice to look at. the episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere. overall, "witching time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments, and decent opener to the series.

this was my first look at this short-lived british tv horror series, but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films (horror of dracula, captain kronos: vampire hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.this first episode was a shocker - not for the horror but for all the nudity. was this "regular" tv in england in 1980? if so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america. there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. hey, i'm not complaining. the story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. the latter, jon finch as "david winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. she was be prunella gee as "mary." the husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "lucinda jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. as a man, i'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! this starts off slowly but once "lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.

possibly john cassavetes best film to date, and definitely his funniest. seymour cassel plays the young moskowitz smitten with real-life wife of cassavetes, gena rowlands, excellent as usual. a must see gem of a film, if you can locate it.

i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes. and for those who have never known of cassavetes. it is an excellent film. i really don't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you're looking for something gutsy, with lots of scenes to mull over, then this one is for you. the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. this "review" does not do the film justice. it is an experience one must view for themselves. lots of character. very genuine.

although it may not be cassavetes' best work, minnie and moskowitz is almost perfect in all its endeavours. the plot is whimsical and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotion -- much more drama than comedy, contrary to imdb's profile. yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary; it succeeds as believable, albeit a tad forced -- which i will come back to. all of the artistic aspects are of true cassavetes form: the cinematography and camera-work are delights, and the soundtrack -- albeit barely there -- is complimentary. plus i believe i noticed some nods to godard and such in the editing -- as i have in a few of cassavetes' other films -- (namely the abrupt cutting of a song in one scene), which are interesting.i feel the plot is built up nicely, with the first half being particularly enjoyable. seymour's conversation with morgan morgan (timothy carey) in the diner, for example, is wonderfully funny and fascinating, and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film. this philosophising -- a tradition in cassavetes' films -- is what made the film for me. seymour's amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one may have of him as a hippie simp -- though his character is curiously similar to that of his in faces (1968). this tipped me, however, (on second viewing) into the opinion that it stands up against cassavetes' best work. i gained an affection for this film that i lacked on first viewing.there are, sadly, several aspects that make this film imperfect. i find the plot to be unbalanced. as i said before, it builds up nicely, but it wanes a bit here and there, particularly towards the end. because of the spontaneous style in which cassavetes worked, and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go either way. in this case it's inconsistent. i assess that most of this film was improvised, and most of it beautifully. but one or two scenes, unfortunately, just don't work. in particular, the scene after seymour fights with minnie's work associate outside her house. during what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film, cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue -- presuming some was planned beforehand. this, i believe, was a mistake. one gets the impression cassel doesn't quite know what to do, as he repeatedly fumbles in his speech, often not making sense, and overacts; all of this damaging the scene and the character development. i understand seymour is intended to be a bit of a brash fool, but cassel's attempts here are misapplied. why does he cut his moustache off? these flaws are resulting from: a lack of direction on cassavetes part; a lack of understanding and forethought on cassel's part; a lack of rehearsal and preparation; etc. evidently, cassavetes didn't learn from his mistakes, as he allowed this same thing to happen in his next film, a woman under the influence (1974) -- the committing scene, and ending.the flaws i mention are not minor, but they do not ruin the film. they simply make some scenes cringe-worthy and unrealistic, spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential. however, i am very, very fond of cassavetes and all of his actors, particularly cassel, in spite of the faults i mentioned. this is a very enjoyable film, although it proves the precariousness of cassavetes' style.

real love. true love. mad love. beautiful love. ugly love. dirty love. sad love. happy love. silly love. smart love. gorgeous love. dumb love. love love love. minnie moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trust her, trust her and love her madly. of course when this man comes along... she tries to run away but seymour, wonderful seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her so he is going to fight for her against her. i want to be like seymour moskowitz. i want to be that kind of man. a man willing to love without been afraid to fail but willing to fail. that's a kind of hero. that's my kind of hero... and minnie moore is my kind of woman. long live cassavetes and all his lovely bunch!

minnie and moskowitz is the most pathetic and ungraceful love story i've ever seen. between minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose abusive married boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more uptight and confused than she already was, and seymour moskowitz, a parking attendant so desperate for attention that he spends his nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating people, there is a chaotic and disenchanted match from the start. just like so many pairings that we see every day.in nearly every love story, there is a man and a woman, the man being confident, funny, either classically hot or attractive in his own way, whose shortcomings are charming, and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man she wants who chooses this guy because there's just something about him. these movies make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. minnie and moskowitz, instead of indulging in any hint of fantasy in the realm of romance, depicts people who may just be more common than the attractive, confident people with so much experience playing the field. what's the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, alarmingly awkward man with no life and no job that we all run into, or the woman so crippled by insecurity that it's difficult to talk to her?this film is not as fascinating as cassavetes's faces or opening night, but it has that riveting quality that cassavetes always fought so hard to render, which is an unbridled depiction of people underneath the ego that hides behind itself in nearly all other films. gena rowlands and seymour cassel, delivering startlingly pitiable people, are hardly likable. moskowitz nearly drives us mad, let alone minnie. he imposes himself so forcefully in her life, the dates are an explosion of the inner voices of ours that respond to the screamingly inept uneasiness on dates we've all been on, rejections we've all swallowed, and arguments we've all had that we know were our own faults. i admire a film like minnie and moskowitz because, as the trademark is with the films cassavetes helmed himself, it identifies with us in 100% honesty. our egos play no part in company with his characters, thus a tremendous achievement per performance by actor.

life is crazy. you're crazy, i'm crazy, we're all crazy. we're all a little bit minnie, and a little bit moskowitz. sometimes it does seem best to be sensible...but then what might you be missing out on?you gotta be you. you don't have to park cars and semi-randomly yell at people, but you can't hide yourself behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is okay. and sometimes, you really do have to throw caution to the wind, because why else are you alive?i'm not going to 'rate' this love compared to cassavetes' other movies, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives. in that sense they are all great, and comparisons are odious. for sure, this movie has that one crazy, sometimes maddening, but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have- you never know what's going to happen next, and you never know what the characters are going to think, do, or feel next. neither do the characters themselves- and do we really want to live our lives any other way? unlike moskowitz, you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira, but still live the life of an adventurer inside- in your feelings, your spirit, and your very experience of life. yeah, we can have it both ways, that's what cassavetes shows us. thank god somebody did.

i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them. these days, though, people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness. it has a slow beginning, but then look out! if you love romantic comedies, but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change {or at least did have back in the 70's}, then you should see this movie!

this light-heated (for cassavetes)love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by gena rowlands and seymour cassell. rowlands was never more beautiful as a repressed, damaged mid-30's woman who meets her match in seymour. cassell is a powderkeg of energy and romantic notions (on his terms). there is a great supporting performance by val avery as zelmo swift and an unusual (as always) timothy carey that's worth the price of admission. made between husbands and a woman under the influence this is cass' most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone (especially the cassavetes haters) who claim his films are too long and ponderously heavy at times. made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people. an 8 out of 10.

oz is by far the best show ever to grace television. better than the sopranos, yes, er, yes, csi, absolutely. uncompromising, daring, and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving. oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television. tom fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing. no topic is taboo. rape, drugs, murder. oz is evidence of just how good tv can be. it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your everyman tobias beecher, in jail for vehicular manslaughter. we see what we don't want to see, pain, death, mayhem. oz will disturb you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all it will make you think. to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production

oz was a fantastic show, as long as frequent male nudity doesn't turn you off. there was way too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you'd see on a porn channel. minus that, it was the best show on tv, and a previous commenter said "better than prime suspect". prime suspect is tom and jerry vs the simpsons. no contest. if you have directv they are now re-running it from the start on channel 101, they're at episode #3 now. highly recommended. the creator tom fontana also did homicide, which was an awesome show. but why all the male nudity? we all know that stuff happens in prison, but did they really need to show it as often? that was the only thing that turned me off the show. if i want to see naked men, guys getting raped, i'll kill someone myself and witness first hand. otherwise i like my tv shows free of black penises every five minutes.

oz is a great series, one of televisions underrated shows. it has a certain relationship to soap opera in that something evil is always happening, and it is the unfolding of each instance of evil that fascinates. from my discussions with people who are actually in prison, it rings true. every interaction has some machination working in the background. behind every action, there lies a scheme, a plot to do someone else in. i like this series so much that it is one of the few tv shows i have bought completely, on dvd.and, yes, i agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it. the character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced view of life does so with a certain bit of ironic humor.

oz is set in oswald state correctional facility. it tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hate and survival at any cost. in a place like oz, you have to have eyes in the back of your head.this completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells of how warped life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of emerald city.what is supposed to be a state of art correctional facility is in fact far from being such. the show brings to light some of the many flaws in the prison system, the underestimating of the humanity that cold hard killers are capable of still retaining, and the one true fact: the prisoners are the one's who control the prison.this magnificent and somewhat surreal show teaches about the importance of every life and helps give an understanding to the reasons that most of the prisoners are there. this show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is, such a thing is necessary.oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.

this is an excellent, suspenseful, murder-mystery movie. not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for a couple hours, what's not to love! also, sandra bullock is good in this movie - i've always been a fan of hers, (i just wish she hadn't decided to be in "the lake house" which was horrible, but that's another story altogether). obviously since there are thousands of other murder/horror movies out there, there are bound to be similarities between them, no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made. anyway, this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy "scary" movies, it's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie!!!

cassie (sandra bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. as an ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and, indeed, left her grievously wounded, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. as the result of her near-death experience, also, cassie favors one-night stands and trusts no one. one day, a woman is found dead in the woods near cassie's community. she has been murdered heinously, beaten severely and left to die alone. naturally, cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers. assigned to help her is fellow officer, sam (ben chaplin). he soon discovers cassie's relentless attitude and all-consuming instincts when she asks him to pick up a sample of vomit that has been left at the scene for analysis, among other actions. the trail soon leads them to two high school students, richard (ryan gosling) and justin (michael pitt). could these teenagers really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect "joy" killing? this is an intriguing film, but viewers should be warned that the subject matter is grim indeed. killing for the "sport" of it is seldom the topic of films that are of the "all sweetness and light" variety and this one is no different. that said, the cast is great. bullock, without a hint of her talent for comedy, is terrific as the police officer whose own past compels her to lock up the evil folks of the world. chaplin, too, is quite nice as the detective who is both attracted and repelled by the forceful cassie. as for gosling, he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. the production values for the movie are good, too, with appropriately fine costumes, settings and photography. if you are a fan of bullock's looking for a laugh, this is not the one for you. but, if you adore mysteries, even those with the grimmest of plots, you will find this tale enthralling.

now, i know that sandra bullock produced this film, but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the story...like not trying to make the whole movie about her character!the story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by the number...just to see if they can get away with it. enter sandra bullock and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. the boys have planted evidence, created alibis, and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act. but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be.this movie could have been a great little hitchcock-style thriller, but the movie spends too much time on getting to know sandra's character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself. you see, something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film. and we get to know all about it...all about it. it just gets rather tedious after a while, especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past.ryan gosling and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie. they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice. if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters, and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs, this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller. with the way it is, most of the thrill is lost. they should have cut out all the stuff with sandra's character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel. but, i digress. it's still an entertaining movie, nonetheless. i do recommend this movie...but wait for the video/dvd.

i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening. i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller.what we have is like "compulsion" meets "matlock". two teens decide to commit a perfect murder. a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found. then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander. (innocent of the murder anyway)enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer. (imdb says that she's fbi, but i don't remember that. i thought that she was a regular cop) she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile ("the profile doesn't fit the profile!") and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys.she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop. but this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. all others are pretty flat.for a thriller, there are really no big thrills. it's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "matlock" (which she's watching at one point in the film). the twist is that there are two involved in the killing. just who is the real murderer, justin or richard? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out.

murder by numbers is a pretty good movie. even though the plot rolls along at a snail's pace, what with sandra bullock's character getting all mixed up with her partner and the movie flashing back to a previous trauma situation she had been in, it does succeed in keeping the viewer involved in the film.having said that, i do think that it does a good job in setting that eerie sort of "who done it" type atmosphere. it keeps you guessing at which one of the boys really was behind the murder, if not both of them. i think ryan gosling and that other kid (lol) do a good job of selling that bully versus dork relationship. not sure about gosling playing a bad-ass, but for a guy who would later star in a movie like the notebook, he did a pretty good job. once the movie gets rolling, though, i really found myself involved in the story, sort of asking myself, "oh my god, what would i do if i were in that situation?" like i said, a good csi type movie, maybe not for the extreme crime drama movie junkie, but a good all around flick.8 outta 10

i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series. otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot themes. i don't like the theme of the two over-clever, selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise, i've no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i don't intend to find out about. but don't misunderstand me, the theme is in itself excellent, the whole movie is so well done, and of course sandra bullock is superlative as always. sandra's character is (as in miss congeniality) not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner. of course sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement. it's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague - he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be "saved, while the other is a true psychopath.sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in poignantly with the murder case. her colleague, realising that sandra's solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior, finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens, that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting - we hope anyway - to do just that. i can see from the few other reviews i've had time to read that this movie would attract a broadish group - those interested in the two spoilt boys whiling away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted, the ghastly links to the heroine's past, a police theme, and some smokes and mirrors - as well as for hitchcock fans.for those who've queried why bullock's character has to have a problematic past, really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on, with a willing sidekick helping out and a male-chauvinist boss. the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby nearly lose her life? that's hardly an original theme, in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is. i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself.i wasn't disappointed re the relationship between bullock's character and her sidekick. that goes along interestingly and at times very poignantly.the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing, if that's what you were interested in watching. i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the movie-makers didn't want to get into boy-boy friendships too much, or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship. the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages.there one thing i wish had been clarified and that's what happens "after the movie ends" when sandra's character arrives at the court.... you need to see to movie to know why she's there.very well acted by all. i certainly can't agree with those who complained against bullock's acting - she was superb. the part suited her very well indeed. the story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine.

this one is about a homicide detective who battles a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up, they seem to outwit the police force seemingly at will. they taunt the detective by planting clues and leading them off on a wild goose chase. this one has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie, sandra bullock does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and battling her inner demons, she can't seem to keep a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to keep leaving her for some reason. altogether this isn't a bad film, it keeps you guessing all the way the very shocking ending.

fans of the pink panther, naked gun, or get smart will certainly enjoy this farce that won one césar and was nominated for four more.jean dujardin is agent oss 117, a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head. he is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the west.all of the russian spies, nazis, and muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is larmina (bérénice bejo) and the princess (aure atika) to keep things interesting.oss 117's uncanny ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments the first time he picks them up, and sing like a native are all more impressive than bond's tricks, but he is still stupid.

the two new oss 117 movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and dumbed-down at the same time, which i find extremely amusing. it really reminds me of the classic pink panther movies with an almost as good leading man as peter sellers in jean dujardin. and unlike steve martin completely ruining clouseau, dujardin is quite brilliant.the comments regarding the movies' being anti-semitic, are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and therefor understanding.whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have. i can't wait for the sequel!

saw the move while in paris in may 2006 ... i was debating between that and mission impossible...i am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france. i had a great time... would recommend it. it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the dvd to come out... i don't know how some of the 'jeu de mots' 'puns' would be translated in english i 'll certainly buy it when it is out! p.s. i saw on 'brice de nice' which is a movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies i have to say that dujardin did a good job in oss 117.

this is the latest entry in the long series of films with the french agent, o.s.s. 117 (the french answer to james bond). the series was launched in the early 1950's, and spawned at least eight films (none of which was ever released in the u.s.). 'o.s.s.117:cairo,nest of spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not...repeat not, be taken too seriously. our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in egypt (with morroco doing stand in for egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. what follows is the standard james bond/inspector cloussou kind of antics. although our man is something of an overt xenophobe,sexist,homophobe, it's treated as pure farce (as i said, don't take it too seriously). although there is a bit of rough language & cartoon violence, it's basically okay for older kids (ages 12 & up). as previously stated in the subject line, just sit back,pass the popcorn & just enjoy.

i loved this film and recommend it to anyone who like a good spy spoof and who thought johnny english was an embarrassment. this is the film je should have been. but it's based on an old french films series so it's not really bond related.the production is brilliant, you'll almost believe the film was shot back in the 60's. it even has that same pastel kind of colouring films had in those days. jean dujardin plays his part with just the right amount of dumbness and naivety, not with ham fisted pantomime silliness like rowan atkinson and even if you don't like the film, you will want to see it for berenice bejo. ooh la la! she is the hotness ...

oss 117 was fun from start to finish.it's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not, and i won't try to analyze such perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)!everything is old fashioned here, from women's clothes (sigh!), mambo dance, the "hero singing"... ("bambino" sounds like an italian canzonetta sung in... arabic :)!).hubert is physically imposing, but dumb as hell. from all the 007s, he looks like sean connery, but is definitely more sympa because he's... silly, speaks his mind all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him. in short, as an anti hero, he rocks :)! sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. bérénice bejo is the true queen of the film. graceful, treacherous but with ideals. aure atika, to the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts. it's surprising to see her that "sexy bomb", thou.you just can't compare it with "austin powers"! i agree with amazon's d. hartley (seattle, wa) on it being respectful to the genre.which is your favourite scene? one of my favourite scenes is the "fight of the chickens" with the masked villain. but the truly perfect one is when chatting at the cocktail with his contacts, how they all mutter platitudes with confidence... this scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.

jean dujardin gets connery's mannerisms down pat: the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him, the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie, the swaggering, steely gait. it's uncanny, and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was connery's creation and not really ian fleming's character. the cinematography is a nod to those early films, the movie takes off from russia with love and thunderball mainly. the main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to egypt. it's not perfect - about 20 mins in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day, of which there were plenty. morcecambe and wise's the intelligence men had suspect-looking men in fez's following their heroes around too, and that's going back a bit. unlike sellers' clouseau or baron cohen's borat, dujardin doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his connery mannerisms. it doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song, and there's no funny or serious villain, like mike myers' dr evil or ricardo montalban's naked gun nemesis, for the hero to go up against.but the scene where oss117 wakes up in cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, plus you'll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen, and the women are ace crumpet, really hot. it's a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist/ken adam sets or funny gadgets routine. throughly recommended.

this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo. okin, played by the incredible haruko sugimara, lends money to two other ex geisha, tamae (chikako hosokawa) and otomi (yuko mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. tamae has a son, otomi a daughter, who during the film announce they're leaving them while okin, never a mother, gets visits from two men in her past who, it turns out, just want money from her. its a compelling tale of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and beholden to. haruko sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding, less than compassionate okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy her. at a time when great films were made by ozu, mizoguchi, kinoshita and kurosawa, amongst others, mr. naruse is right up there with him. if you have a region free dvd player, you should attempt to find the two naruse box sets released in england. i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. that they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.

naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film, the other two being ozu and mizoguchi. this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas. whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? well, for those who are interested, watch this film. one: okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited. naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters. bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness, and one's life-worth. very good film indeed.

a look at three geishas who are way past their prime. now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. kin (played by floating weeds' haruko sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. the other two, nobu and tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other). tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. nobu's concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) self-serving. after her son leaves, she'll be alone. a bit into the film, two of kin's former clients come looking for her, one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him, the other one of her handsomest clients. unfortunately, he comes for her money, not her love. the way i've described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing, but it's really not. sad, but not fatally so. it's more bittersweet. unfortunately, i only marginally liked late chrysanthemums. the story seems better when i look back on it, but it is very slow and dull. i actually nodded off twice during the film, and i wasn't at all tired before i started it. this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of ozu's more famous films. 7/10.

mikio naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war japan is a wonderful character piece. they used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work. complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home. this leads to the bitter, grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender. meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. the three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or, at the very most, toss complaints back and forth to each other."late chrysanthemums" is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do much with very little. i haven't seen much of his work but i suspect that this isn't his best, even though it is very good. the problem, i think, is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much. but the film is full of good points. although it is cynical, it isn't overly so. naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery. while the film isn't a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director, precious little of which is available on video here in the u. s.

for me, "late chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first film of naruse i completely enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work i've seen. this doesn't mean innovative editing in the way godard would introduce it with "breathless" in 1959, but quite the opposite.the editing was as fluent as in the best of hollywood films from the 30s/40s, but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story. unlike them, it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself "invisible" but, together with the cinematography, made me feel like i was traveling on a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle. in this sense the film was comparable to ozu's and mizoguchi's work, but somehow even more subtle.what was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera-work in dreyer's ordet (1954) or vredens dag (1943) which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us.i feel that naruse's editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious. the wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either! i found the story itself to be rather conventional.the narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and i thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations. unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up (though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other - less complex - film). somehow i felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. maybe he should have kept them intact. this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film, especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way ozu dealt with the plot in his films. unfortunately i haven't yet the feeling that naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films' conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion. the best efforts i have seen to date - ukigumo (floating clouds / 1955) and midaregumo (scattered clouds / 1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative, while delivering poignant and resonant endings.this is already more than most director's are able to do, and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium. in this regard, and considering the resonance of the last two films i've seen by him, he may have already become one of my favorites.the only problem i have at the moment, is where i'm going to see more of his films on the big screen.

i loved this thing. the most wonderful thing about pink flamingos is that it strives desperately to be in horrible taste, but has really gained a cult following world wide. says a lot about us (us being people) doesn't it. pink flamingos succeeds because waters made the film he wanted to make. a film need not be disgusting to succeed, but it may be. when you watch this film, you see things that are disgusting, but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. what we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist, be it in film or any other media, should watch this film.

the film that gave us john waters is one of the funniest films ever. yes it may be gross but it's filled with hysterical moments that nobody has done since. the infamous dog-scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema. not a film for the easily offended it's one of those movies where you always see something new. divine's performance is worth the reputation. mink stole is hysterical. this is the film responsible for the farrely brothers and the entire gross-out comedy genre. i know that sounds a bit extreme but think about it. before this comedies were very run of the mill and almost identical. after this movie comedies became strange and weird, but in a good way. i'd give it 15 out of 10 if i could.

sadness and nostalgia permeate late chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by japanese auteur mikio naruse, now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to james quandt of cinematheque ontario and the japan foundation. based on three stories by fumiko hayashi, late chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas, now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. performance are uniformly outstanding, particularly that of haruko sugimura, who starred in films by ozu's late spring, floating weeds, and tokyo story among others. sugimura portrays kin, a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak.she has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends, nobu (sadako sawamura), tamae (chikako hosokawa), and tomi (yuko mochizuki), all former geishas. kin's friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how kin has become greedy and tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet. both tomi and tamae are in the process of losing their children. tamae's son is leaving to work in the coalmines in hokkaido, and tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable.two male friends visit kin, seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide, and tabe (ken uehara), another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years. her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as kin confronts tabe and tomi and tamae console each other over the loss of their children the dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, though their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves merely as victims. late chrysanthemums has the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.

out of any category, this is one demented and over the edge film, even in todays standards. filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this film will blow your mind (and something else too!)the amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing. the dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy. you'll either love or hate this film, but give it go. i've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it. divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive, but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and stylish little film. divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be missed greatly. edith massey does the unforgettable performance as the "egglady" and don't forget the energetic mink stole!über crazy s**t! recommended also for you sick little puppies;female trouble desperate living polyester

more entertaining than all the gay orgies in "300" combined. more heartbreaking than a shakespearian tragedy. more poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. and on top of all that, the greatest trash ever made.a black comedy testing the limits of the human senses, john waters's cult movie "pink flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation, death and of course the eating of dog feces (yeah by the way that is not actually the humiliating part). no no, this is not about the impossible love, there are no romeos or juliets on these 90 or so minutes. this movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. the battle for the title - filthiest person alive.on one side we have divine (played by the cross-dressing waters regular... umm... divine) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of said title. she loves her son crackers a bit way too much. crackers himself sports a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in threesomes. family friend and loyal accomplice cotton gets her satisfaction from watching crackers during some of his... acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction. last but not least divine's mother and grandmother to crackers, edie. a 400 hundred pound woman, sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby cradle. she is addicted to eggs and loves the egg-man (the man who brings the eggs...lol).the four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the marbles. exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, very evil people actually. their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnating of young women. for the impregnating part they use their trusted and loyal cross-dressing butler to provide the semen. after that they sale the birthed child to the highest bidder.it was the marbles's envy towards divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. an epic battle of filth, perversion and violence."pink flamingos" is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash-movie genre. loaded with oddities and strange acts, john waters's movie is loathed and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average movie-going audience. but for the few that remain unscratched by these generalizations the flamingos is an unforgettable experience. funny and sick, violent and poetic. it truly is an exercise in poor taste

for me, pink flamingos lived up to it's reputation as being the shocking, disgusting, repulsive, trashy film i was expecting it to be, that really contains everything but the kitchen sink. we are treated to almost two hours of nastiness that never lets up: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and a horrid display of singing out ones anus. it is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family, trying to steal their title as the "filthiest people alive". divine (a fat guy in drag) is an unbelievably vile human being, who actually becomes painful to watch. trust me when i say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten, especially the end scene in which divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk. i have always thought john waters was over-rated and i cannot say i like this film, but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it.

i grew up in baltimore, so i was exposed to the films of john waters, since i was way too young to watch them. and if you're knowledge of john waters is limited to hairspray or cry-baby, or other family friendly movies, then you must prepare yourself for pink flamingos.explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unsanitary acts with chickens are just a mere portion of some of the depravity in this movie. the film ends with divine, waters' 300 lbs. cross-dressing star eating dog excrement.the premise is about two families: one a pair of inbred trailer trash, which includes divine and edith massey as the egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. both families are competing for the title of "filthiest person alive." enjoy john waters' finest movie, but only see it if you're an open-minded individual with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will gross you out.

you know the saying "curiosity killed the cat"? well, i have heard so much about this film, from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies you must see before you die, my sister who saw this at a film festival, and the i love the 70's show on vh1. i just had to see this movie since it was named the grossest movie of all time, and well, after viewing this film last night, i have to say that it really did live up to it's title. my god, this movie was so weird! i thought i really did see it all with some of the sickest movies and tv shows i've seen, some things i guess will always still feel like a shock.well, babs johnson, aka divine, has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title. they want to take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them, and selling their babies to lesbian couples. but it seems like divine and her family of well... i don't know, seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens, butt lip syncing, eating dog feces, stuffing meat up their skirts, incest, and it just gets grosser and grosser.pink flamingos is horribly acted, horribly made, and well, just plain horrible. the reason for the 10 rating i'm going to give it is due to the fact, well, how could you rate this film? i always rate, so i just figure what the heck? through the grossness of this film, you have got to give john waters some credit, who the heck would ever think of this movie over 35 years later? to the cast and crew who worked on this film, you guys are just plain nasty!10/10

babs johnson (divine) lives in a trailer with her son crackers, her daughter cotton and her mother edie (edie massey). she's in competition with a couple named connie and raymond marbles (mink stole, david lochary) to be named the filthiest person alive. the film shows their attempts to outdo each other.this film is very much not for everyone. it's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste. crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches; the marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. it's disgusting but, in a way, not unwatchable. it's so over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. as director john waters might say, it's bad taste done well. also it's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched (especially by massey) that you just watch it in disbelief. a friend laughed out loud at how bad massey was (she improved in later pictures).this is not for people who are easily offended. even though it's over 30 years old it's still shocking. however if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must-see. the only part that really was too much is what divine does at the very end.

what's there to say about "pink flamingos"? it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. you will either get it, or you won't, laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). john waters is an odd filmmaker (putting that mildly), mixing both innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well, who knows what his intentions were. it is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one.the thing that makes waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that form the plot of "pink flamingos". surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of "the filthiest person alive." what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy, self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. the people in his films are completely in tune with one another. for instance, when cotton tells babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his "lady friend" out to the trailer, babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her, in a conspiratorial aside, "that little shed's just perfect..." at this point, we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his "lady friend" out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that waters creates.another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing, the marbles' deviant butler. the first time we see them, waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connie's cozy office to channing descending into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very much alive and p***ed off. susan is not a cowering victim, but is enraged and abusive to channing, leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. later in the film, when divine and crackers break into the marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are pandering--here is something divine is unfamiliar with, a corruption devised by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. furthermore, while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free, relishing the revenge that they take on channing.at the other end of the filth spectrum, waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. the first time we see connie, she is belittling a minor character named sandy sandstone, who has never heard of divine. cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of divine's title as the "filthiest person alive", revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially divine, who doesn't miss a note. not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given, and it takes "pink flamingos" to a new level or weirdness. people actually believed divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who made it. since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.but even more so, "pink flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now (i say mostly because the a**hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince), i still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming.

a very strange, disturbing but intriguing film. i don't think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt, and i doubt if i'll ever want to see it again. that said, there is much to be amused by, like divine's take on jayne mansfield's classic walk in "the girl can't help it" and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store. a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film. generally poor acting, with the notable exception of divine.

my 10/10 rating of course applies only if you're willing to get completely and utterly grossed out*. because you know that only john waters can do that. in "pink flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive. what divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question. but even aside from that, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine. you had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. even some of the lines are rather mind-blowing.*otherwise, avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus!

like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on pearl harbor, every one who has ever seen pink flamingos can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it--and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile, obnoxious, repulsive, and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones.filmed with a close-to-zero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around, pink flamingos tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of "the filthiest people alive." just how filthy can they be? plenty: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what i can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo, and i guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it.the cast is either wonderful, atrocious, or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. the star, of course, is divine... and to describe divine as the biggest drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year. she is a mammoth creature given to big eye makeup, big orange hair, and big expressions--she is the charleton heston of drag, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn, or startling real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny. others in the cast include mary vivian pearce, danny mills, and the ever-appalling edith massey as members of divine's family; and mink stole and david lochary as the white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge divine's status.it should be pretty obvious that pink flamingos is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one, and viewers who know director john waters only through such later films as hairspray and crybaby will be in for a major jolt. but if you want to see something so completely different that even monty python couldn't imagine it, this is the movie for you. just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't want to eat afterward--and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

subtle, delicate ,touching.a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy. history of a coming -out and anatomy of relationship.soft ambiguous gestures, slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression.two men, a girl, a afternoon on beach, some words and a gift. religious traces and a pantheist vision. cercle of light and expression, nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening.a erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives values.pledge for self- discover, universe of beauty exploration, the sign of ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation, "robe d'ete" is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream, to look, with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people.

"pink flamingos" is a cult classic.the plot of this film revolves around the throwdown challenge to divine's supremacy as the filthiest person alive."pink flamingos" contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eats fresh dog feces.yes,the movie is shocking and funny at the same time,but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines.check out especially this line from divine:"kill everyone now!condone first degree murder!advocate cannibalism!eat s***!filth is my politics!filth is my life!".on the whole,i really enjoyed this film.still its tagline "an exercise in bad taste" should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach.highly recommended.

this is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it really happend! in case you haven't noticed: it's based on a true story.(possible spoiler)imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once a ss officer in ww ii.it's a very intriguing story and i'm really surprised the movie is rated a lousy 5.3 here on imdb.com.my rate: 7

i watched this movie "miniseries" on television back in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. i would love to track down a copy of it just to watch it again and again. it's been 15 years since i watched it and it still sticks out in my mind. from the beginning, it draws you in. the characters and plot line keep holding you. the ending was superb. the feeling and rage that the son displayed when finding out the truth about his father are unforgettable. the suspense on how it will turn out and how he will confront his father is really intense.if you can get a copy of this movie, you will thoroughly enjoy watching it.then, email me and tell me where i can get a copy.

i stumbled upon this movie by chance. i was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night. not much else on and figured i watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until i decided to go to bed. needless to say, i stayed up and watched the complete movie. the plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been ss who did this or at least thought of doing it. i have been looking all over for this movie. i even sent and email to the production company, but the weren't sure that it would ever make it to dvd, but said there was always hope. if anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it, as i'd sure like to get a copy some day.

i expected it to be good, after i'd seen some other ozon's superb moments, and read much about it... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very bright (emotionally and visionally), perfect in all moments. every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about it's simplicity.

there's not a dull moment in francois ozon's "robe d'ete". it's surprising how much is packed into this short film. while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. she invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. on returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. she lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl. his gay companion is sexually excited. early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended. she suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance. it's a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.

i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon. i've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.this film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might). watch for the feelings, not for their objects.very nice and fleeting, truly like a summer romance, and while being a relaxation to thought and mind, it gives some food for the soul.

this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. one knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.well, forget it. the movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow. all right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder. but this movie doesn't let you go.it's like the old gangster movies, but then without any glamour at all and in russia. and that's one of the most important aspects of this movie: it's situated in russia. this does have a great impact on the movie, according to me it makes it better. everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. this could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the russian mafia.it is a beautifull and terrifying movie. it's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. one last advice: don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.

first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i'm not easy to scare, but second half of this thriller didn't work quite a well, but still very scary! a good thriller, than use simple ways to make good horror. lowbudget, set in russia, unknown cast, and made in europe. but still great fun, and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well!

if you want to see a true thriller, rent this!!! it's not from the director or screenwriter of "scream", doesn't feature overacting, overpaid "tv" actors passing off as "stars", and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza. instead you'll get a top-notch, edgy, very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter.

well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end. it has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and i recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.

mute witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. the film  written and directed entirely by anthony waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. no pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. mute witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in russia. *** spoilers *** since the production costs are cheaper there, a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film. an old hangar is used as film location. the female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie! she's caught and tries to escape but, since she's a mute, she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly. the girl's life is in real danger now, since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be alive *** end spoilers ***. mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody. some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end. regarding the similar topic, i'd say it's definitely better than the more famous `8 mm', directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage. the acting in mute witness isn't great, but the leading actress (who's russian herself) looks really cute. sir alec guinness makes a special appearance, too. and a very cool one, i may say. surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.

this is a very good movie. i give it a 10.it's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.she sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). i won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.don't miss this movie.

superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well.the cast play it very well, although richards' self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times. the tiny two-scene cameo by sir alec guinness, oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow, is simply the icing on the cake.well worth repeated viewing, but not on dark nights when you're all alone!

an intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night. after she tries to get away from the murder scene, she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness. this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat.

this is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made. you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end. even though there are some plot holes, it keeps being exciting to the final showdown. besides "8 mm" and "peeping tom" this is one of the best films about "snuff movies", a taboo theme of our culture. if you like the scream trilogy, you will probably love that one.

i love this movie ! i think i've seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv). ok, it's a thriller and there is great tension. but mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! and very original. the directing and photography are just splendid.

i've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on tv. eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. it's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. what lies beneath - over hyped and crap. mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.

the plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. there is a plenty of comic relief, too. some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first "chase" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). the russians actually speak russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well.

i enjoyed the acting in this movie. except for the sister. she reminded me of janice on friends. i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. my main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. the guy falling out of the exploding car? maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then i could have gone for the ending. i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene. mainly the brother-in-law. he was such a pain in the ass anyway. or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. i could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films. it is worth watching again and as i always say, it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author.

despite myself, i really kinda like this movie. pauley shore is invariably laugh-out-loud funny, and here is no exception. he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold.his performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good, it seems to lift other cast members' performances. perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce off of.the clichés about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way shore's "city boy", crawl is so at odds with the way of life, is funny too, but it's not only he who's a fish out of water; comedy also comes from the fact, that to any "ordinary" person or people, crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person. that's why this movie works in such a great way: we love crawl, he's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathise with the warners. he is one hell of a culture shock.although this movie is classic pauley shore, so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie, enjoy it you do, and there's even a "never judge a book by it's cover" type moral here somewhere. not bad, not bad at all.

i didn't expect much when i decided to watch this movie, so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it. a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably. the characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. the fun of it comes from watching crawl (shore's character), a ditzy-yet-wise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving, trying in his awkward (yet endearing) way to fit in to their lifestyle. i was also surprised that in all this there was a message. if you have a chance, see this movie!

i love it! i love pauly shore. it seems some people don't agree. it's humor, and he's not like everyone else. the movie is great. i love the story line and most of the people in the movie. it's funny from the first time she meets him at school. i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home. i like that tiffani theissan isn't a bad girl in the end. all the secrets are let out. only the people you want to see are left in the end. (except for those of you who don't like pauly shore.) even if you don't like him, there are funny parts, and her family tortures him through most of the movie. she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard. she finally makes it. it's got just the right amount of love and romance. i give it an 8 out of 10.

one of our all time family favorites. when we need a laugh...we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it. this film has good, clean family humor. pauly shore is brilliant! with no plans for the thanksgiving holiday, crawl (shore) is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed, becca. crawl, being a big city boy, must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with becca. but, crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things. crawl teaches becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others. this is fun for viewers of all ages.

along with in the army!, this ranks as one of pauly shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. while the whole west coast-meets- midwest-culture-clash isn't anything new, this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore. while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was rather entertaining. not only was shore's interaction with the family hilarious, it also had carla gugino and tiffani- amber theissen (she'll always have the amber in my book) in two ravishing and early roles. one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv.

this is, without doubt, one of my favourite horror films ever! i really cannot believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors, mute witness has all the style, suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcock/depalma movie, coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot. it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is.the plot centres on billie hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory. by a series of events, she finds herself accidentally locked in, and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made. as the main character is mute, she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie, and a curse in others.the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well, even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both hitchcock's "psycho" as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes.while the acting can be hammy at times, the whole film does hold it together, not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end.all in all, a hugely overlooked, well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy/jason/scream/michael myers/damien regurgitation's at hallowe'en.

one of my all-time favourite movies. nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. if i could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time. it's still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. if you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film. its chilling, shocking, full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too. if you watch this film and don't love it i truly question your sanity!

i don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.i saw this film on tv, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. so it is all the more tense.even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.the filmmakers play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. the shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.the well written situations n twists,fast camera movements, slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. this film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock. i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film.

man, i never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. while i expected some hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. this film-inside-film shows a female stabbed "victim" messing the whole set until she finally "die". her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that mute witness is not a typically horror movie.the main character, the mute american make-up artist billy hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina. her performance is top-notch; her character can't speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.and, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. her sister (fay ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the "in-film director" (evan richards). they were both very funny most of the time. i won't spoil more, but the scenes following the bathtub moment, with them two, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.the plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment. but don't worry. such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.

apart from being a clever and well-marketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general, i always somewhat considered "supernatural" as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades. although not always noticeable to younger viewers and/or people who only have an interest in more recent horror films, each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles. from that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the 'creepy vehicle without a driver' type of films, and even more specifically the 70's milestones "duel" (steven spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "the car". being an avid fan of these two films, i enjoyed "route 666" a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings. the episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote missourian road, where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel. the victim's daughter, cassie, happens to be dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the winchester brothers in for help. the brothers can't prevent two more similar "accidents" before discovering the ghost-truck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60's, involving both of cassie's parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town. some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label "route 666" as one of the weaker entries in season one, mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of dean's character. he's usually the strong silent type, whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. to a certain level i agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much, really. the writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as i'm concerned. concerning dean's emotional vulnerability, i can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters. dean's behavior towards cassie sheds a whole new light on him, in fact. besides, what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks. it's an impressive and overpowering vehicle, producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises. in case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned "duel", you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in "route 666".

excellent episode, showed dean has not only good taste by picking cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman, and he's not just some guy who loves and leaves em! aweso e episode. applaud them on this one. i only hope that some way they go back to the cassie relationship next season (if there is a next season??) i would like to see her come back into their "supernatural" lives especially dean's. also i like the fact the chose an african-american woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow. i hope they don't screw that up and end it as he episdoe ended. the girl who played cassie was truly a looker and it was good to see the wb branching out into what we all see in everyday life-the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable(finally!)

in today's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it. movies like psycho and blair witch, while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. with mute witness, a rare treat, i stumbled upon this film and watched it, scared witless, in the middle of the night. i was scared by the menacing russian ambience, the 'snuff' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing, which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second. since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations. it also has fay ripley in a rare movie role, watch and prepare to be excited, scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways.

in a lonely road in cape girardeau, missouri, a black man driving a car is chased and hit by a truck, falling off-road and dying. his daughter cassie robinson calls her former boyfriend dean and asks him to investigate the mysterious accident. sam and dean see that three afro-americans and the caucasian major of the town were killed in weird accidents on the same road. when the truck threatens cassie, her caucasian mother mrs. robinson tells a tragic racist murder that happened thirty years ago, and the brothers realize that they have to fight against a hatred spirit in a ghost truck.in this episode, dean discloses his first and unique love to his brother, surprising sam and showing that he has feelings, but also that his hunting wish is stronger than his love. the story is only reasonable, touching in the delicate theme of racism in an efficient manner and blending it with a supernatural event. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "rota 666" ("route 666")

i just watched "return from lonesome dove" and it was very good! i've seen a lot of negative comments about it and i don't think the viewers are being real about it! in the television/ movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part. we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d. faithfully!! this production was top notch with the original music score, and the actors put their hearts into it(you can tell). if you want to watch lonesome d. with robert duvall and tommy l. j. then watch the original. return to l.d. didn't have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less. from the touching moments to the villains, this one is a winner! "wonderful!!!"

at first glance of this mini... i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and anjelica huston didn't return to the cast. both john voight and barbara hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western. cherokee jack jackson (haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and louis gossett jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills.the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant shoot-out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film. return to lonesome dove was to me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. the next 2 follow ups with james garner as call just didn't make it for me. and that lorena marries pea eye? how the heck did that get in their? that was a total mismatch of characters. the first 2 of the series made the epic story, the next 2 in no way were of the same quality.now, if the first 2 could be remastered in dolby digital and an anamorphic presentation, the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today.

i had my reservations about watching the return to lonesome dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much. without tommy lee jones reprising his role as woodrow call or anjelica huston as clara, i figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough. upon viewing 'return' i can honestly say it's a worthy successor. the actors really make the show with jon voight, rick schroder, and oliver reed all preforming at their very best. i admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first, but 'return' definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have. anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that the return to lonesome dove succeeds in capturing the 'feel' of the original and will not disappoint. do yourself a favor and check it out, ol' gus would be proud!

this a wonderful sequel to the award winning lonesome dove miniseries in the 1980's. this sequel is perhaps, better than the original. it is definitely more family friendly. the language is more subdued. there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with cherokee jack is particularly gruesome. however, overall a great movie. the acting is superb. william peterson is fantastic. such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. jon voight aptly fills tommy lee jones' shoes as captain call. ricky shroder gives a great heart-filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. highly recommended.

let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "lonesome dove" than i. both the pulitzer prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving, dramatic, believable, and engrossing works. there is no comparison between "lonesome dove" and any western film- at least not since the legendary collaborations of john ford and john wayne. it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new mini-series, what with mcmurtry's non-participation, and the missing original cast members. after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no "lonesome dove". in almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. but so what? i wasn't expecting it to measure up. taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging, entertaining and of a very good quality. if it were done as a new story, not as a sequel to "lonesome dove", there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. jon voight did a creditable job as call, barbara hershey was a terrific clara, and the new characters like gideon walker and agostina vega were well rendered and believable. louis gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler isom pickett. the film made me care about the characters, and i don't ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor- it is worth viewing in it's own right.

i've seen lonesome dove, dead man's walk, and the streets of laredo, and now the return to lonesome dove. if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove, this'll fill yer belly. great cast, great story. most definitely a close second to lonesome dove. i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection. this is the best, or at least my favorite performance by jon voight. he is captain call. lou gossett jr. playing isom pickett is not somebody i'd mess with, he is a bad ass with perspective. william peterson does a great job as well. rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue. my only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that i had the impression that call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in montana", and it's obvious that dunnigan had already been there a while. a little inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale. i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper fant and july johnson. i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.

not a larry mcmurty masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western, any of the lonesome doves do. who ever takes on the role of woodrow call, does a great portrayal in their own style. it's also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the t.v series (both version of it) and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive william peterson was awesome in this, the geeky c.s.i guy is not the character he plays in this - this guy can do it all it seemsit's deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns4out5 stars

let me say first off that i am a huge fan of the original series lonesome dove and the book it was based from. i have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews i'd heard about it. if tommy lee jones wasn't playing capt. call i didn't see the point. if larry mcmurtry wasn't involved why should i care? how wrong i was.this is in so many ways a worthy sequel to lonesome dove, maybe even more so than the dark mood of streets of laredo. the story, acting, production, cinematography are all top-notch. of course the script isn't as colorful as lonesome dove but it has it's moments. and, much to my surprise, there are bits of lonesome done in this series; the relationship between july and clara, completely dismissed in the prequel, is brought up here almost identical to the book, a most welcome surprise. the story isn't all roses, it has it's surprises too. by far the biggest surprise is jon voight's interpretation of capt. call. while not a direct copy of tommy lee jones' his is both faithful and unique to voight's credit. the cast is fantastic all across the board, and i don't think rick schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series. oliver reed practically steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him.it is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms, especially that the dvd is so affordable (i got the 2-disc set for $10.99, you can probably find it cheaper). it is in no way the disappointment that dead man's walk turned out (well, it was for me). and mcmurtry was involved with that one!

a rich experience is to be gained from watching this film.this is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil, yiu kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical chinese poetry. he is married with two sons, and things at home seem normal. he still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder one) and disappointment (the younger one).his passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes. the student, choi lam, draws pictures of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. she teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, although that too is an element. he of course is not immune to her attention, though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in place.the reason why he doesn't succeed in the end is complicated. firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and choi lam. it becomes clear that she genuinely likes him, and it's mutual. secondly, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. the consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear.nothing is treated trivially in this film. all the characters have a vivid internal life, and an easily discernible history. the two leads, jacky cheung and anita mui, are outstanding, as are karena lam as the student choi lam, and shaun tam as the elder son on yin.recommended without reservation.

i couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. comparisons to hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. it walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. like many of hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out. right from the opening shots, they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster. the plot twists and turns unpredictably. suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork, imagery, music -- but most simply the eyes of the characters, which sends raw fear right into you. a warning: there is some frighteningly real gore, as well as some nudity. the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic.and a teen-slasher pic it ain't. the characters are quirky and feel like real people, for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as i did. there will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown-ups. i mean, alec guinness is in it, briefly, and you know he didn't need the work!pop this in the vcr some night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to, yet.

this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner, something which sets it apart from most films with this plot. mr. lam (jacky cheung) has a relationship with choy (karena lam, who was also so good in "koma") in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation. he is married for 20 years to ching (the great anita mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship. when ching offers to care for hers and mr. lam's former teacher, choy and mr. lam have the opportunity to be together. what makes the film so good is director ann hui's pacing. it takes a while to uncover the secrets of the lamsm and it all makes sense. the movie is very dramatic and touching. you don't feel any repulsion about the teacher/student situation, something that elevates this film above many with the same plot. it is slow moving, but stay with it. also, revel in ms. mui's wonderful, unglamorous but beautiful performance. she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time. it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her.

a touching love story reminiscent of in the mood for love'. drawing heavily on chinese poetry and how this is used by eastern people to communicate feelings to each other, the story focuses on a schoolteacher who wants so much to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father. a senior student is very attracted to him. as the story unfolds we see the emotions below the surface in his 20 year marriage and how he grapples with the moral dilemmas that face him. a beautiful and moving story.

excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had some teeth to it without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative & artificially gratifying. might be a good double feature with american beauty as well. best performance to date that i've seen from anita mui, and every actor in this seems like a powerhouse. hats off to ann hui for the direction and ivy ho for the brilliant script. seriously one of the best dramas i've seen in a while, especially if you have a taste for classical literature ala poetry. again, excellent.

hummmm,...another keystone comedy set in the park!!! it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park, as so many of chaplin's and arbuckle's films are set there! and, while this is yet another one, it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it.fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand. i think she's supposed to be a little younger, though in her mother's eyes she is too young to be interested in men. well, fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun. things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift,...and many problems result.decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film.

i really liked two coyotes. one of my friends rented it the other night and we were really impressed with how good it was and how cool the main guys were. i wonder if they are thinking of making a sequel because that would be excellent!two coyotes rocks!

this first time writer/director comes across as a season pro with "two coyotes". most action dramas are all about the action first then the story. but this picture works the other way around. if this is just the beginning for this director, then hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star. independent movie making has once again reached a new level.

this film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. the director does an excellent job of riding the line between emotional and physical violence. but in the end, he remembers what so many indie-films forget - he tells a good story. when watching this film i was reminded of how timid and mundane most big-budget hollywood films really have become.especially notable, is an exceptionally strong performance by the film's lead - jorge cordova. as an villainous thug (on his way to the top of the crime heap) cordova plays a conniving, brutal, conceited, devious, and sleazy s.o.b., but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time. i read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of latino filmmakers in los angeles - called la nueva obra, or something like that. either way, this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work.

first, i must say that i don't speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films... but two coyotes is an exceptional film. there is enough action and hard drama that it doesn't matter that its a spanish speaking film. the subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action - or the drama!i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and non-fans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie. the action and drama are worth every penny.

i was very impressed with this film from newcomer dir./writer jose reyes. the cast was excellent. "jorge cordoba" executed a powerfuland shocking performance as the lead character of "rafa". it's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent. it takes talent, courage, and determination to go out and make a quality film.i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile. it's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly, but i applaud "jose reyes" and the talented cast for their successful efforts.

one of the most underrated comedies. dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role; charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in "midnight run;" and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued, sometimes wacky film. akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together....

the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie. then the story gets more and more outrageous. the main character portrayed by marina sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role. this could have been a super-great movie had the ending been more realistic.

"the couch trip" is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s. in this case, dan aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles grodin. most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).it's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. don't expect any kind of religious experience. but you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people flaunt their wealth. also starring walter matthau, donna dixon, arye gross and victoria jackson (of "uhf").

dan ackroyd in his prime stars as johgn burns, a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to la la land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (charle grodin in his snarling prime) takes a vacation. along the way, ackroyd hooks up with walter matthau, a fellow nutjob, and the rest is sheer hilarity. ackroyd and matthau play off very well off one another. ackroyd's stunning real-life wife, donna dixon, is along for the ride as yet another shrink. the ending feels a bit rushed and contrived, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating, an 8. a lost '80s gem.

this is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci-fi movie. balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. she spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. very atmospheric and effective. it is true that kinski does not appear very much in this film, but the staring actors are very good. there is only an english dubbed version available in the us, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. the cinematography, by academy award winner vittorio storaro is excellent. an earlier giallo by director bazzoni, the fifth cord, is also excellent, and also lensed by storarro.

when, oh, when will someone like anchor bay or blue underground release this on widescreen dvd??? le orme, which i only know because of my rare/vintage video collecting habit, is a film in my collection that i would not only sit through, but actually enjoy watching. the fact that klaus kinski is top billed, but is only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time.) i cannot say that this is a good horror film, a good mystery, a sci-fi epic or anything of that nature. it is simply unclassifiable in the "genre" sense of things. it is more like a confusing, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream, filled with great visuals and mystery. it relies on visuals and emotion, much like bava's "lisa and the devil". both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner; they both occur in such a dream-like atmosphere. don't be deterred by force video's synopsis on the back cover. it is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. though force video's release from 1986 (the only one in the us, that i know of) is cropped to full-screen on tape, even in that format it is still great. releasing it remastered and/or letterboxed would make it magnificent (hint, hint... dvd companies).

this a haunting piece of work.its only ten minutes long but i would sooner pay ten bucks into the cinema to see this than to see any full lenght movie currently doing the rounds. it is a simple piece of a man's reflection.he arrived a young man in this place and was mesmerised by a room and the music coming from it...and now here he sits,dying in old age in this place he so fondly connects to his youth. the music in it is brilliant,the guitars have that jazz-room twang like neil young's music in dead man. if you get the chance,watch this film.its worth it.if rutger hauer made more films like this i think he would get more respect than he gets.at the moment you hear him put under phrases like "everybody's favourite psycho".im sure that is not what rutger would want to be rememered as an actor for.he also directed this film,so in this shows that he a very artistic actor/director.a change from the b-grade movies he has been doing since the early 90's.i hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is one of my favourite actors.

it must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens, yet still grip the viewers attention. i think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing, wise and fatherly, (i'm not gay) it reminds of the qualities that robert redford has in narrating. the end is very sad, but beautiful. one wonders how long harry has left, will he be lonely and will he get to say his goodbyes? also one gets annoyed at mr hauer for not getting involved in more work of this caliber. lets hope he continues to do fine work in holland and stays away from hollywood.worth watching

just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years. i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever. the innocence and purity of a time now long gone, is truthfully captured in this small film. the acting is above average and richard gere's brief appearance as a shell-shocked raider marine war hero, holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan. jan-micheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the "all-american" boy. the late bruno kirby (who was billed as b.kirby, jr.) has a meaty role as "pop", a peace-loving, marine corp reject, dreaming of getting back home to his wife. if you're looking for sex, drugs, or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. if you're looking for action and adventure, the same applies. however, if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence, honor, romance, and love, then baby blue marine is a movie for you.

cheezy? yep. poorly filmed? you betcha. zero budget? they proudly claim it on their posters. brilliant anyway (or because of it)? for sure.this movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket! this is not an all-out spoof like scary movie, but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies... when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun, silly, sexy, and goofy good time!

ok, so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers, but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted, right? right! consider yourselves officially warned, and read on...in this parody/tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980's - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee, who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard. as i'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "where's the beef??" and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get. good times...no clique or 80's horror movie clichéd characterizations are left unrepresented here. in fact, no stone was left unturned at all  we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the goth chick, the tough thug (think john bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt, a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians, and two big geeks.as you can plainly see, the cast is pretty big. usually, larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly, with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel. not in this case though. not a single cast member left me disappointed. the acting was very well done. everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the grooovy goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one & two played by cory assink & jonathan brett  they all played it straight, brought their a-game, and knocked it out of the park. if you're a fan of gary & wyatt in weird science, you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks.director/co-writer jeff c. smith is a guy to watch for in the future, trust me on this. if this is what he can do with a low budget, there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects. the characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed, and squirted, and sprayed beautifully  it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's. call this one "the breakfast club meets night of the demons"!!! the tag line says it all, and says it honestly - "excessive violence; gratuitous nudity; zero budget" - no false advertising here, folks! as fans of this genre, we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales, lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down pg-13 'horror' or pointless remakes like the hitcher. no, thank you - no more of that for me.in closing, i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die! is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year. it's a bloody good time, and holds up on repeat viewings. from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe...even the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80's power ballads by reo speedwagon - over-pronounced r's on every word starting with the letter 'r' - then i'll eat my dvd right now)...bottom line is, if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general, no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!

loved this movie! kicking it old school! love the idea. love the script. love the characters. i really really really loved the geeks! i was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. this was right up with my favs such as saturday the 14th and pandemonium. if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie! only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound. not bad sound but would have liked to have more. great blood splatters. great murder weapons. great costumes! i really love the nod to the great 80's teenager stereotype ala breakfast club. and i can appreciate the non-cgi suspense. really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to cgi. i would rather have good fake that really fake fake.kisses to the cast and makers! oh, loved the "making-of" too!

stmd! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films i've seen in quite some time. director jeff smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.stmd! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. it has all the "excessive violence" and "gratuitous nudity" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love. i had a blast watching stmd! from the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldn't get enough!

it's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee. after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. sound familiar? it's supposed to. it's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: "excessive violence. gratuitous nudity. zero budget." can't get enough; it's pure entertainment! i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror cliché's, but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time. there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though: good acting. the entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks, recent or otherwise. there was a lot of chemistry between the characters. i was very entertained throughout the entire film, and i am fully convinced the writer/director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers. the script was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally.the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well, but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget, i already know this going in. this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy. although this is not an oscar award winning opus, it never claims to be, and props to that. it's a lot of fun. if you like slashers, you'll really appreciate this film. if you like blood and boobies, you'll appreciate it also.

this brass eye special paedo-geddon was swamped by complaints ( more on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible " sarah`s law " following the abduction and murder of school girl sarah payne . in fact it`s scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled nonce-senseif truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud . the edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims . chris morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile . cue the child`s frightened screams . like i said very poor taste other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ( " no one knows this but it`s a scientific fact " ) labour mp barbara follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and kate thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim " who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel " . morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they`re classed as obscene . the photos included barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head , a dog`s body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to john holmes . hey i never said this show was tasteful did i ? it`s impossible to mention paedo-geddon without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians , childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject . the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it`s a biting satire . perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of britain before they criticise a mere tv show for exacerbating tensions .

'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era "cold mountain," starring jude law, nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film.then again, calling cold mountain" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts "glory" director edward zwick shame. however, "cold mountain" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived."cold mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by renée zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern "lawman," and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of northern aggression," mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.make no mistake, "cold mountain" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.

i really enjoyed this both times i watched it. and both times, i walked away thinking about it, and the "morals of the story" a great deal. i agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centred around the sci-fi aspects you might expect from an alien-on-earth movie, but rather is about the human condition. the characters in the psych hospital provide a great insight in to that, and how they go from hopelessness to hope. this movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final "is he or isn't he". that final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered, i feel it is done in far more detail than something wishywashy like say, the movie ronin (with robert de niro) where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it. i highly recommend k-pax. 8/10

kevin spacey again picks a winner with k-pax, an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the prot character's naive, yet at the same time unquestionably wise, point of view.it's enjoyable trying to work out 'if he is or he isn't' as the plot expands and the robert porter character gets fleshed out. however some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldn't have been any other way.my few issues with the film revolve around the rather cartoony and over simplified portrayal of mental patients. i was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and i don't feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behave.that said, i realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitly shot and the story unwraps at a pleasing rate. bridges is great and spacey delivers a languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien.a good film that will get you talking with your friends.

i thoroughly enjoyed this film. i had read the book a good ten years ago and was intrigued about how it would translate to film.the screenplay is very true to the book, which i was charmed by - this is a rarity in itself these days. the characterisations were solid and believeable, and the stroytelling kept me shifting in my perceptions, even though i already knew the ending from the book.an intelligent and well crafted film.

after watching this movie once, it quickly became one of my favorites. as different events happen in the movie, you change your mind about prot, back and forth, until the end and even after. the movie is very thought-provoking and a must-watch!!

at last, a movie that handles the probability of alien visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth. just in case we're not alone, i do believe that these visitors are just too touristíc to care for us or give that wayward bunch of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence. we wouldn't interfere in the battle rites of some agitated desert tribe either, unless we're out for messing with our travel insurance, huh?anyway, the movie depicts the transitional cathexis of a weary mind and body by a superior entity. that happens quite unspectacular and rather unrecognized, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? so prot's hospitalization is just a trigger to the plot.jeff bridges acts great as usual, but spacey is hilarious. the role seems tailored downright to him, convincing and lovingly "mad". eating unpeeled bananas, sitting in a tree, giving his doctor a hard time with quickness, wisdom and (most of all!) stunning quotes. they made me think and philosophize for hours already.it's an encouraging film, to say the least, and the soundtrack by edward shearmur is simply beautiful. just go and get a copy. catch a beam of light. now.

who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: "go to hell." thanks. it had to be said! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke...i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that: "haven't you got anything better to do with your time? what are you trying to prove?" thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the matter...cheers

who's the man~~~ what's that i hear? a resounding cry of kevin? well if you didn't shout for the 'usual suspect' i'd recommend changing your medicated prescription. anyway this is no first class movie, just a very well produced story, that is almost believable. considering its about an alien your probably wondering what the? all acting is top stuff and also the first i've seen a balanced, sarcastic alien. just enjoyable is all i can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). seven stars

*may be spoilers* no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre i've ever seen. is prot an alien or just a crazy bugger? this is the question you'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie. kevin spacey is simply amazing, as is jeff bridges. you can't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times. some of kevin spaceys actions in this movie are very funny. when he was up in the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared.to simply put it, right from the start you'll be hooked, and if you really love drama's you won't be dissapointed.a solid 85%.

(possible *spoilers* warning)you never know. the guy keeps telling he's an alien but... oops, seems to be the most human in the whole story. arrived from distant planet. said weird things. advanced the earth's science. healed the doctor... or was it just a crazy dream? you never know. better see k-pax for yourself. think.great acting of all the cast. don't forget to notice the music, it's right in a place. lot of fun, some sadness. 8 of 10, after all.

if you like movies that will make you think, this is absolutely one of the good ones. i always liked david lynch and cronenberg. they have always made high-quality movies.iain softley has directed k-pax brilliantly. the movie tears in feelings and philosophy of the mind and world. kevin spacey and jeff bridges both delivers superb acting skills. it caught me, i did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie. on the other hand, if you are hoping for a special effect sci-fi movie, this is not for you. the story is being dragged a bit, which can be a bit boring, but also works as a way of building up the theme of the movie. enjoy this film, i did..

i thought this movie was highly underrated. the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange, and i was put off at first, but once i was watching the movie, it didn't seem strange at all. i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer, and i couldn't wait to find out how it would end. once it did end....i thought about it for a long time after. i was pleased with everything about k-pax, from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues, to the ending. it's not an especially upbeat or happy film, though it does make you chuckle from time to time, but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought-provoking. i own it now, and intend to watch it many times.

prot (kevin spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called k-pax. his psychiatrist, dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) tries to help him, all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from k-pax.this movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. one big part of k-pax is drama/ science-fiction, another part fantasy, plus, add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what k-pax is all about. the story (as you see above) isn't too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me. no special effects or graphics accompany this movie, and there's no need to have them, the music in the film is great however. a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes k-pax sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes intriguing.kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (prot) from the planet k-pax, emotional with great facial expressions, spacey does a fine job in the lead role. jeff bridges is dr. powell, that aids and attempts to understand prot. bridges is also excellent in his part. bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should, after all, they've both had a lot of experience. the wife of dr. powell is rachel powell, played by mary mccormack. mccormack plays her part well, showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient. alfe woodard plays dr. powell's coworker claudia villars, we don't really see claudia too much, but overall she puts in an alright performance.k-pax is rated pg-13 for "a sequence of violent images, and brief language and sensuality", and that covers it. as far as "violent images" go, we don't see too much. a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them, but that's all. language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words, and a few uses of the lord's name in vain. not too bad really. the "sensuality" part is just from when prot explains to dr. powell how reproduction works on k-pax, nothing terrible, just something about it feels like "having your nuts in a vice." not too bad on the content level for a pg-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse.in conclusion, k-pax is not a bad movie. it won't stun you, but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. it has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well you know what i mean. it's a story of a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to, k-pax is a well done movie.bonus! if you've seen this movie already, like it, and are thinking about getting the dvd, i would highly recommend it. it has loads of extras to look through, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10

a beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and heart-warming story. excellent direction, perfect cast, marvellous script, excellent score, beautifully lit...... need i say more?if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart (some that spring to mind are 'contact', 'field of dreams' and 'groundhog day') then you're sure to love k-pax.most highly recommended.

well, not much really to say about this. but it is really good. very good job from softley directing and the movie have good cast of acting. movies plot is also believable and... hehe good. so the good is main word in this case. i just hope there would be more this kind scifi movies. thats why this one s pointed out in the crowd. i give it 8.5 of 10

just watched this and it was amazing. was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not. so if you are...and like watching other than brainless action-movies...don't hesitate any longer. don't let the dull cover put you off. the script is one of the best ever. inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy, and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and didn't have any boring moments. it also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling.also the acting is great (one of kevin spacey's best roles). the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well-chosen. if i have to come up with something negative to say about it....well....i can't really find anything......enjoy! 10 out of 10

this is a movie that will leave you thinking, is he or isn't he? while many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs. this is my interpretation and theory, and i believe it is very sound. first, here is the plot. one day, prot (kevin spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. after attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to bellevue, and later transferred to dr. mark powell's (jeff bridges) hospital. prot freely talks about how he came from the planet k-pax and is here to do a report on earth. naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. he befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. in fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. soon dr. powell is beginning to question prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove prot wrong. in the end, dr. powell learns that prot is robert porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in new mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. prot claims that he plans to leave for k-pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. the time comes and goes, and powell finds prot or robert in a catatonic state. one of the patients is missing and is never found again. on to my theory: prot is not crazy. prot is from the planet k-pax. robert porter is a friend of prot's. on one of prot's previous visits to earth, robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. prot and robert became best friends. after the death of his family, and robert slaying the murderer, robert decides to commit suicide. prot is on k-pax at the time, but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop robert. so prot takes over the thinking of robert, taking over his body so to speak. awhile later, prot (still inhabiting robert's body) comes to new york and is locked up. when he leaves for k-pax on july 27, he takes bess with him, but he must leave robert's body behind. hence, we now have the catatonic robert.explanations or clues:prot's knowledge of the planets around libra: as prot says, any child knows about their own system. only a few people on earth had an inkling about the system, and prot added to their knowledge. robert porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. dr powell feels chosen by prot: it's true. prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. prot's last words to dr. powell are, "now that you've found robert. take care of him." prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for robert when he left. super-human abilities: it was a proven fact that prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see uv rays. prot provides his usual k-pax reason, but there was no earthly reason given. it was also mentioned that prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.helping the patients: throughout the movie, you see prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. while the psychologist balk at prot's help, dr. powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.the sprinkler scene: the sprinkler is associated with porter's home in new mexico (which is ironically where roswell is). does porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? is her trying to protect powell's daughter from that horrible fate? i have a different point of view. it is assumed that porter had committed suicide in a river. indeed, prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about robert. i believe that prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. he is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did robert.hypnosis: dr. powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover prot's true identity, but while prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his prot persona and claimed homeland of k-pax.the security camera: why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? mysterious disappearances: first, prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. sometimes i think they understand better than the staff. naturally, the most telling disappearance is of bess, the winner of the essay contest. not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.this is only my humble theory. you can conclude what you want. you can take dr. powell's theory, that prot was merely a persona taken up by robert porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.

chris morris' brass eye tv series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. but, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. the 2001 brass eye special. before the hugely overrated jerry springer opera arrived, the brass eye special held the record for the most complaints received about any tv program ever aired.the sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the brass eye special was unbelievable! many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! the subject that the program handled turned many heads, but the message was widely misinterpreted. the message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. this was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. the show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject. morris, is and always will be, a media satirist. the notion that the program 'makes fun' of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! morris never attempts to do either such thing. he merely draws our attention to the overwhelming, and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject.using many of his established 'brass eye' characters, such as, ted maul and others, morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything morris has done previously. using his tried and tested formula, morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. in actuality, they are made to look like exactly what they are. retards.all in all, the brass eye special needs to be seen to be believed. and, with one opening line, morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: "welcome to paedo-gedden!"

at least for me. and rather unexpected -as subject. a movie that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach on everything. that helps you see the world you , we live in through a lens - or a multitude of lens...a moving, surprising and haunting movie.and it benefits of one of the best performances ever from kevin spacey. seconded very well by jeff bridges. there isn't a false note in this tango. it's a perfect dance. perfect 'till the end.what does the ending reveal ? well...everything you want it to...a movie one will want to see again. maybe not right away. maybe after a few days. months. years. but it's something to go - or come - back to.

if you have enjoyed the butterfly effect, donnie darko or the machinist, you will enjoy k-pax too.to me, this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end. spacey delivers a great performance as prot. also, lets not forget the appearance of saul williams in the movie, who i am a big fan of.after watching it, i recommended the movie to lots of my friends, and everyone was pretty much blown away.but still, it is very underrated, maybe because of the lack of action and explosions. i'm sorry, this is not a movie about blowing things up, it's about how humans behave, and how people live in worlds that don't exist.go on, and enjoy.

the always delightful kevin spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives. after driving us into believing he is a mumbling small time crook (only to expose the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic the usual suspect; this time around he leads us into believing he is prot, a likable alien who assumes a human form whilst strolling around the earth.prot is a peculiar stranger who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere, only to be hospitalized in the manhattan psychiatric institution. dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) soon takes extreme interest in him, and even finds himself pondering if prot is actually a supreme being from planet k-pax, or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues. while the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex, enlightening journey which leaves a gr eat deal of intriguing/philosophical questions behind it.

in kpax softley brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of prot. spacey (prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in buddhism and hinduism. it can be said that prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but prot sees truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly.the film is particularly detailed, therefore i would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how softley interjects nuances. listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies.9 of out 10 rating - superb - with nominal room for improvement.

i was truly surprised when i first saw this movie directed by iain softley; it differs in so much ways from the usual hollywood mass-production. the plot itself is simple - kevin spacey plays a mental patient prot who claims to be from the planet k-pax who arrived to earth by a beam of light, while dr. powell played by jeff bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions... first of all, i must admit the cast is perfectly chosen: kevin spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of prot, always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not... some of the gem scenes include the one where prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with dr. powell; or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the k-pax system to the astonished astronomers... jeff bridges on the other hand is the subtle, rational side of this movie, and he delivers it perfectly. there is a whole other cast of excellent actors (like saul williams' convincing performance as ernie) who make this film truly work.k-pax has it all, elements of comedy; sci-fi, even psychological thriller (concerning the prot's identity) but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama. the main premise of the movie is quite intricate, but the director never lets it get loose, he always keeps it believable and yet two-ways interpretable. the camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing the main idea of light travel, there is much focus on light-shadow play, lightning settings - one of the memorable scenes is where dr. powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true? subtle and slow paced, intriguing and pleasurable, k-pax is truly a gem to watch, one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it - might fall in love with it.

following a mugging incident at new york's grand central station, an innocent bystander (kevin spacey, "the usual suspects") is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. we can understand why they think this, considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright." and so prot (as he identifies himself, pronounced as rhyming with "goat,") is shipped off to the psychiatric institute of manhattan, where a weary workaholic doctor, mark powell (jeff bridges, "the big lebowski"), attempts to understand this man's so-called delusion.prot's manner is courteous and cooperative. when asked why he believes he has been institutionalised, he matter-of-factly replies that it is because "you think i'm crazy." within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for earth-fruit, the completely forthright prot has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet k-pax, which resides 1000 light-years away, circling the binary star system agape and satori located in the lyra constellation. he also details how his infinitely-more advanced species has already mastered faster-than-light travel, through harnessing the energy of light, an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human race.powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, though he is nevertheless fascinated by them, and commits himself to understanding how prot came to believe such a thing. meanwhile, prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, eventually offering everybody around him something to live for, and hope of a cure. on july 27, prot later reveals, he will depart again for k-pax, and he can only take one human with him. of what will actually happen on that date, nobody is certain.originally slated to play dr. powell  with will smith as prot  kevin spacey stepped into the main role when smith had to withdraw from the film. you can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character, the completely matter-of-fact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("your produce alone has been worth the trip") often eliciting genuine laughter. there is undeniable intelligence behind many of prot's words, but logic maintains that he must be delusional... mustn't he?the audience is led back and forth between the possibilities  for the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that prot is an extraterrestrial (this is a sci-fi movie, isn't it?!), before being totally convinced when prot inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a newly-discovered planet system. a final investigation by dr. powell offers us a neatly-packaged terrestrial explanation for prot's delusions, but this is just as quickly whisked away, and we are left scratching our heads again. the film, quite rightly, keeps its ending open, leaving the audience to contemplate what they've just watched and to discuss it with those around them. nevertheless, whether you believe prot to be an alien or not, two irresistible certainties linger in your mind: the universe is, indeed, a fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover.

one of the best movies ever, the idea of a double interpretation involves we all. would be prot a schizophrenic or an e.t? (no doubt in my opinion, but let's keep the question open...). kevin spacey, the big screen monster, plays prot as it should be done. let's not forget jeff bridges and his great psychiatric. lastly, a masterpiece that speakes for itself. can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over. if you still didn't watch it, go right now! and again, again...

usually i do not like movies with/about aliens but k-pax is different. the actors are great in the movie - especially kevin spacey played his character breathtaking! the movie never fall to a lower level - the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends, what's about prot... you have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions... is robert porter prot or is prot only using robert porters body as a means of transportation. how can he see uv-light and how can he know that much about astrology. but everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe. very good movie with an excellent kevin spacey!

i'm a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously. i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey, also.the general plot of "alien in human body" has, in my experience, been done to death, but i liked the approach taken in k-pax, which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most. bridges makes an excellent doctor (you *want* to tell him what's on your mind) and spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role.the interaction between prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour.the ending is bittersweet - i like prot's choice, but the final scenes (with bridges) made me teary.

personally, i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the greatest. this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges, it can't be bad. and that's exactly what this movie is! "k-pax" is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years. to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story. it's part of what makes the movie so great. the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting. the combination spacey-bridges really works.this was already the second time i saw the movie and i'm sure it won't be the last time. "k-pax" has everything. there are moments which are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high-class drama. i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards. great movie! 9/10

the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects, such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set, the suits, the smug presenters, the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and stats, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career ("there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact"). it may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire is supposed to be challenging, and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media, just because it's a delicate matter. how this show failed to win any tv awards for it's intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thought provocation is shameful, but, as watching it will show you, not in the least bit surprising.

this film is brilliant...... without a doubt. watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which i am not), and thought it was quite good. but after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it is good.kevin spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and i really like jeff bridges (big lewbowski, blown away, arlington road). the film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.that is how the story evolves with bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) a great film... that get's you wondering.....8/10 dave

due to a very misleading advertising campaign, i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10. the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy, and i bugged my parents until they took me. after seeing the movie, i was blown away. i had no idea what to think. totally different than anything i had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. needless to say, i loved it. this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. the supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. the open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me. if you haven't seen this film, run to wal-mart right now. the dvd is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! 9.5/10

k-pax is exactly what a heart warming film should be. the story is about a mysterious mental patient prot, played by kevin spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist dr. powel, played by jeff bridges. the two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows dr. powel can't help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient, who insists he is from another planet called k-pax. this film is very funny, and kevin spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature. k-pax is a smart film, and i wasn't expecting it to go where it did. in the end, i found myself thinking about the small things in life, and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted. i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, k-pax is a splendid film, that will not disappoint. i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy, action packed, gore fests.

life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. and what of the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? who is to say what exists or what is possible? valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in `k-pax,' directed by iain softley, and starring kevin spacey and jeff bridges. in the wake of an incident in new york's central station, a man named prot (spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in manhattan, where he is delivered into the care of dr. mark powell (bridges), who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet k-pax. it quickly becomes a challenge for dr. powell, as prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all, and red delicious apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. but it's powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of dr. powell, who finds himself in something of a quandary-- prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for k-pax, a scheduled return trip that allows powell but a short time to sort it all out. and powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly, if he is ever going to know the truth. and he has to know. the truth, after all, is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.	softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. and as you never know for sure about prot until the denouement, you are able to identify with powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that prot just may be what he says he is. and in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed, it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. how do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves? while at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in prot, but in dr. powell, as well. all of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.	as we've come to expect, kevin spacey gives a brilliant performance as prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. this is a unique individual, and spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. for this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what prot is; we do, and it does. spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. it's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time.	jeff bridges, meanwhile, emerges on equal footing with spacey, adeptly making a very real person of dr. powell. it's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, opposite the character of prot was no small task. and, again, for this film to work it was necessary for bridges to rise to the occasion. and, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without question. bridges infuses powell with an underlying complexity, and is so giving in his performance, that it makes the interaction between powell and prot vibrant, and at times intense. it's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. it's a great job by bridges, who never attempts to steal the spotlight from prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.	the supporting cast includes mary mccormack (rachel), alfre woodard (dr. villers), ajay naidu (dr. naidiu), vincent laresca (navarro), kimberly scott (joyce), conchata ferrell (betty) and saul williams (ernie). an entertaining, emotionally involving film, `k-pax' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. it's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it. in the end, it makes you realize just how real k-pax is; and it makes you appreciate prot's journey, and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us, human or alien. and it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where you've been and where you're going. and that's the magic of the movies. i rate this one 10/10. 

k-pax is a very intriguing film. is prot (kevin spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien? that is the question that dr. powell (jeff bridges) must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that prot sets for his departure from earth.as the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility. his ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess. yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration. the ending seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. normally, i don't like lady or tiger endings, but this one is tantalizing. i have my own theory that fits all the clues, but i don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's.director iain softley (`wings of the dove') spins the tale delicately, with great skill. this is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate. this is not to say that the directing is technically inferior, because it is excellent. however, softley remains unobtrusive, delivering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream, `look how brilliant i am!'kevin spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as prot. this is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring spacey to render the cool and logical prot one minute, and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next. spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult. jeff bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about prot.this is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. i rated it a 9/10. if you must have closure at the end of a film, this movie will be very frustrating. however, if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits, you won't be disappointed.

i got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 dvds. i knew nothing about the history of the series. season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4. season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being beyond good and evil with an original air date of 7 december 1998. the other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from december 1997 to febrausry 1998. so beyond good and evil looks like season 3 episode 1, except there are no more episodes in season 3.spoilers here. the two main characters of the first 8 episodes, dr. iain mccallum (john hannah) and dr. angela moloney (zara turner), are missing from this episode being replaced by dr. dan gallagher (nathaniel parker) and dr. charley fielding (eva pope). i recognized nathaniel parker from the series the inspector lynley mysteries, which began in 2001. so they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast.it seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character, mccallum, when the main character is gone from the series. so they might have been planning a return of dr. iain mccallum, but when that failed the series was canceled. i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and nathaniel parker were involved in other projects in 1999. does anyone have any information on this?

as with some of the best films and series, i stumbled across this quite by accident. it was late, a storm was in full force outside and i was sitting comfortably on the sofa when i flicked past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes. i intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom. about an hour and a half later i remembered my resolve and was so happy that i hadn't done that. needless to say i made sure i saw all the other episodes.john hannah has been brilliant in almost everything i have seen him in and he does not let down here either. all other cast members do a stellar job too. my personal favourite (aside from john hannah, of course) is gerard murphy.the only negative side to this series are the limited amount of episodes. only 8 with jh himself and an additional 1 with someone else. i would love to see mccallum back on the screens, though it would have to be with jh!

a mixture of alien and ghost busters?starts very promising, then slows down to almost boring. lifeforce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid 80's. the story is intriguing, but becomes quite lack lustre in the end. it was rated r because of the nudeness, sex and gore. mathilda may's ethereal and savage (naked) beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie. a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made. this could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a great hit, i think it actually flopped quite bad. so, something went wrong with this one, but still, it's very entertaining.

without a doubt, one of tobe hoppor's best! epic storytellng, great special effects, and the spacegirl (vamp me baby!).

non-stop action and just about every conceivable (and inconceivable!) sci-fi/horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun, big-budget epic. the pace never lets up, especially in the shorter us version, which tightens things up considerably.

ida lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in "beware, my lovely," a 1952 film from rko. lupino and ryan did three films together and worked well as a team, both being consummate professionals and strong performers. in this film, based on a broadway play called "the man," lupino is a world war i widow who rents out a room in her home. she's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years, she's not ready to move on. the man who rents her room goes on vacation, and lupino hires robert ryan to help her with some heavy-duty cleaning in the house. he's friendly enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locking her in the house, and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door, as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality.the character played by ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in. it isn't clear whether or not he's the killer, since he seems surprised to see the body. he might be a split personality, as when his personality turns ugly toward lupino, he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it. he doesn't know that he has the keys to lupino's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door."beware, my lovely," is a very suspenseful film, and the two leads give terrific performances. the tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you're not expecting.

lifeforce is certainly one of tobe hooper's best films. it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan's dream. the film is quit creative though and i think that's because of the script from dan o'bannon and don jakoby. nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film.

ok, let's get this out of the way first: as a piece of cinema, lifeforce is rubbish. as a bit of cheesy entertainment for sf buffs, it's got a lot of merit. if you enjoy watching those old black and white sf b-movies - giant mutated spiders/ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert - you really will get a kick out of lifeforce.bad things: the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor. good things: the special effects are halfway decent; it has a welcomingly different british centered story (it's set in london) which gives different feel to most sf movies; and it has the well-endowed mathilda may (amusingly billed as "space girl") wandering around stark naked. in short: it's fun. i've seen it half a dozen times now, and every time it comes on tv i make time to watch it - admittedly this is partly to do with the naked ms. may - but it's also to do with the enjoying a bit of unassuming and silly sf.

i finally got hold of lifeforce on dvd with the widescreen format intact and rousing henry mancini score to the max. after having viewed lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, i have to say that the 'uncut' dvd version was both great and disappointing. the u.s. version is so *much* better than the dvd (european?) version. the u.s. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the dvd version is terrible. feels like an unfinished cut). and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem. in fact one "new" moment almost destroys the entire movie, when caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. i love this scene, in the u.s. version though. on the dvd, the male alien speaks to caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. it's the pinnacle of hilarity:"it'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me!" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. i was floored when i saw this. it just doesn't belong in the movie. that scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. i'm glad hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in north america. there are several changes that were made for the u.s. version that make lifeforce that much better and i wished the dvd had the u.s. version. the editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the u.s. version are even more boring on the dvd version because of added scenes. and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible. much better in the u.s. version. more subtle.i love this film. it's basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much lifeforce as possible. the film has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when the action goes to london, it's fun. the film really shines in these scenes. one can see hooper finally doing what he's great at: chaos, savagery, horror! lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. they're the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. it's also the best zombie movie ever. the zombies are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but i love it. it leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.and to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to e.t. or cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. no wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!as for the dvd, well, it ain't great. the image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. but it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. i just hope that they'll release a clean, crisp u.s. version on a dvd, and with commentary by hooper and dykstra.

i am surprised so few have good words for this movie. for its time (the 80's) it was a very entertaining and engaging story. casting was good. story was good. special effects were remarkable for the time period. deserving of an 8/10.

lifeforce (1985) was a cannon funded film directed by tobe hooper. it's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to earth during the latest space shuttle mission. steve railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy. but really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of mathilda may. she's one smoking hot number. the director was a huge fan of female vampire (a.k.a. erotikill). miss may recreates lina romay's title role the film is beautifully photographed and directed. there's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy.i have to give this film a very high rating. tobe hooper was the man. he made three interesting films for cannon during this time period (texas chainsaw massacre ii and invaders from mars as well). if you like science fiction/horror films, tobe hooper films or mathilda may this film's just up your alley.highest recommendation!did i mention mathilda may is smoking hot?

something i think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future. no other theatrical movie that i can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study halley's comet that a disaster would occur! some differences were: the "churchill" (the shuttle in the movie) actually went to the comet, the "challenger" was only in low earth orbit; the "churchill" was merely burned out inside, whereas the "challenger" exploded--hey the vampires had to get back to earth. one great similarity (and this is always bad luck!) both had mixed male/female crews--the legend of halley's comet and disaster continues!other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasn't been said before. as a outer space/science fiction/horror/sex film individually it provided nothing really new, but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts. and taken together, this was a highly original and satisfying combination.i just wish mathilda may would drain her victims through another part of the body!

based on the book "space vampires" by colin wilson. this is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of sci-fi horror to come out of the eighties. the effects (done by ilm) still hold up by todays standards. the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic. tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low takings. but for whatever reason, it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well-paced plot. not to be over-looked.

this really is a great movie. i don't think it has ever gotten the recognition that it deserves. i have bought this movie on vhs and dvd. the special effects were ahead of its time. the story was way cool. the pace was very steady. if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to check it out on dvd if possible.

by far one of the best sci-fi films out there. however, it does take multible viewings to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect, but the main plot of the film itself. it is my own feelings that this film film got such poor reviews because no one took the time to watch the film the way it was meant to be seen. it does have some moments you wish would hurry up and pass by, but they are few and far between. hooper, who directed tcm 1 and 2 along with a remake of invaders from mars, and the funhouse does his best work here. great score, good acting,and great effects makes this a film to add to your collection, if you get the chance see the widescreen version on dvd, highly recommended to any one who is a fan of sci-fi.

a lot of people say the end did not make sense, but it did. with the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off, having picked up a lot of lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. it seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous, but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. all you can ask for is consistency. the viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for scifi. the only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. that puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. so that is a problem. the only major inconsistency i found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and carlsen go up to the ship. i assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. what about all the humans killed? do their qui forces ("souls") go up to the ship as discrete entities, are does all the lifeforce get merged into one, for use as ship sees fit? in other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures. the basic concept is no more ridiculous than star wars "force" or even re-incarnation. this movie was over the top, kitchen sink (dawn of the dead meets alien meets dracula), but in many ways profound. it was also a beautiful love story. the beginning and end were ethereal. it both began ("what is happening to me") and ended as a love story. most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.so what? bizarre is an art form. as far as being ludicrous, it all fits. the plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens just killing people. maybe they didn't need patrick steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very far out, surreal, scene. another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. but the end fits perfectly with the beginning. people are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. its a lover story,from start to finish. it starts with carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. so it fits perfectly. most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why i love it. instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them going back to ship, to be reborn. way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that is exactly why it bombed. it was not a straight-up horror or even scifi/horror at all, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and end. all those souls twinkling on the ship. and the crystal room pulsating with new life. most people can't deal with a love story that is also alien meets dawn of the dead meets dracula.

beware, my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did.a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. he then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside. a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off. eventually, the man leaves, acting as if nothing has happened.i can see why beware, my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas. some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time. i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too.the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath, ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boy.this is certainly robert ryan's most chilling performance i've seen. a must see.rating: 4 stars out of 5.

is it a perfect movie? no. it is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it features vampires from space, naked beauties and the british army efficiency.when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may. actually, if it weren't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie, i probably wouldn't have rated it so high, but given her sheer magnificence, i am now actually considering voting it up!lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now. imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story, but with completely over the top performances. i still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as mathilda may), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. oh, and did i mention mathilda may is young, beautiful and naked?

lifeforce is an extremely schizophrenic movie, based on colin wilson`s novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novel`s concepts and structure ( indeed it owes more to the quatermass serials than the novel ) but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film . and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history , it`s though it was written in chapters by several different people. take for instance carlson , he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered brits and it`s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film . and there`s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill they`re flying over it .i could go on at great length about these plot holes but lifeforce is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don`t use your brain . it`s good to see a sci-fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldn`t get their hands on them . the special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good , there`s lots of action and stunts and lifeforce features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl . when mentioning lifeforce in conversation with males it`s always a race to say " seen the alien in lifeforce? she can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime " hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females" don`t worry . a naked girl can`t escape from here " can`t she ? pity

to the guy who hatched the idea for lifeforce i have one thing to say: thank you, sir! lifeforce combines the big-budget sci-fi pomp of star trek: the motion picture with the cheap horror thrills of phantasm and tops it all off with t-ts-- and some real meaty hangers at that..and best of all, it's actually a good movie! it amazes me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hot chick to appear naked on screen for an hour and a half to producers. god bless you, all of you who were involved.steve railsback (helter skelter) plays col. carlson, the american commander of an international space mission sent to investigate halley's comet. carlson's crew finds an alien vessel inside the comet and inside that they find three naked people in suspended animation--two guys and a hot broad (mathilda may). well, to make a long story short, they're "space vampires"...naked "space vampires." they trash the crew except for col. blueballs who decided that he had to let the hot chick out of her lucite display case because the part of his brain that controls his nut fluids told him it was the right thing to do. the col. wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. meanwhile, another space shuttle crew has discovered his ship floating dead in space and has brought the three space coffins of the living dead martians back to london. and that's when people start turning into pork rinds and s--t in general just starts getting' way out of hand too damn fast.carlson teams up with the unflappable col. caine (peter firth) of the british s.a.s. to track down our naked cutie--who is having one hell of a time sucking guys off left and right. carlson's discovered that he has a mental link with vampira that allows them to track her down, with the ultimate goal being to blow her ass away and wreck her and her pals' big space umbrella that sucks up the energy of the people that the vamps attack. will they succeed in time? minor spoiler: yes.wow. what can i say but "wow"? this damn movie really works. i can't believe they got actual british actors like aubrey morris (a clockwork orange) and patrick stewart (sexiest man alive or some such title) to appear in this film. all the actors are good. direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of london. special effects are no slouch either. for 1985, this movie must've been the s--t as far as fx goes. all the effects are fairly impressive and there's a wide range of talent on display here in animotronics, makeup effects, light shows, and very nice space scenes with some good old-fashioned modeling and matte painting--very nicely done. there's even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the horror fanboys out there.lifeforce is a great film for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular films on the bigsceen were made with 100% love from start to finish. the creators of the movie really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that doesn't let you turn away because the proceedings are just too good-looking. real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.

tobe hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'lifeforce' is an adaptation of colin wilson's 'the space vampires'. the script by 'alien's dan o' bannon and don jakoby) varies a bit i was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and hailey's comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by earth a few weeks after the films release (so i've read).the story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by steve railsback) sent to investigate hailey's comet as it passes by earth. all goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. the team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. the crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.a bit later the ship returns to earth but no contact can be made by nasa and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. upon docking with the churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. but the three humanoids remain. however it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. if you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. the goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.thankfully the commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed london dry of their souls.tobe hooper (of 'the texas chain saw massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. the production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. production designer john graysmark (fresh off 'the bounty (1984)') uses every bit of four stages at elsree studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. cinematographer alan hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'star wars vi: return of the jedi' (1983) and three consecutive james bond episodes. hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. oscar winner john dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'star wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. heck even maestro henry mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. in the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of steve railsback and newcomer mathilda may (vampire queen). railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. that comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. gorgeous french actress may doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. job accomplished and where do i sign up to be victim? i really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins {the stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (miss may.duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). the only thing they didn't touch on was religion but i think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod.in short (yeah right 800 words later) 'lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. the effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. 4 of 5.

no, "lifeforce" is not a great movie.it's not a good movie.it is, however, an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline (and, of course, mathilda may). it may actually be one of my favorite sf/horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires. how often do you see that? not even in "alien" (the sf/horror flick of all time) does science come into the story at all. in "lifeforce" they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable world.now, do i think it's successful? no. i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one 'villian' and there are one too many road trips.to be honest, the movie is eye candy and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong, scary, sf/horror movie.if the remake does happen, however, i demand that mathilda may have a cameo.

lifeforce starts in outer space where the hms churchill tracks haley's comet & it's equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet, unable to contact earth because of interference colonel tom carlsen (steve railsback) decides this is the one & only chance to investigate it. going outside in spacesuits carlsen & some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship & find the remains of a bat like race of creatures & three perfect looking humanoids, two men (chris jagger & bill malin) & a beautiful woman (mathilda may) all of whom they take aboard the churchill. thirty days later & back on earth the churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead. the rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though & take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life & start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust, things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout london...this english production was produced by the notorious menahem golan & yoram globus who during the early 80's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris & they wanted to move into the big time & signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal (which were this lifeforce, the invaders from mars (1986) remake & the texas chainsaw massacre 2 (1986) a sequel to hooper's own classic) all of which flopped & basically bankrupt both golan & globus & cannon was no more. anyway, despite being a commercial flop at the box-office i have to say i think lifeforce is a highly enjoyable, if rather silly sci-fi horror. when originally released into theatres back in '85 lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by golan & globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd, vhs, laserdisc & tv although apparently hooper's original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there's even more footage out there somewhere. i will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut, the script by dan o'bannon, don jakoby & uncredited rewrites by michael armstrong & olaf pooley was based on the 1976 novel 'the space vampires' by colin wilson & has many extraordinary ideas, it's scope is truly ambitious & one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one. it moves along like a rocket & at heart there's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle. there are also some hilarious moments in lifeforce, the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic, the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where railsback ends up kissing patrick stewart & many, many more besides. i don't know, call me weird but i just thought lifeforce was tremendous fun & highly entertaining in just about every way, from silly character's, odd dialogue, strange ideas that never quite come together & some terrific visuals lifeforce certainly isn't a film that will bore you.director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has (double what he had for poltergeist (1982) even) & he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen, john dykstra the guy responsible for star wars (1977), star trek: the motion picture (1979) & more recently spider-man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects & generally speaking they look fabulous. the sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great, there's also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as 100's of blue souls fly around everywhere. there's some nudity but not much gore, there are some withered corpses, a few gunshot wounds, the skin on someones hand peels off, blood spurts from someones eyes, nose & ears & there's a severed arm as well as some zombies. the special make-up effects are also generally very good. i wouldn't say lifeforce is scary as such as it's more of a sci-fi film than horror, i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness & that there is no 'solid' floor as it were.with a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 it made less than half that in it's theatrical run & hasn't set the world alight on video or dvd either which is a shame because although it's a bit of a mess it's very enjoyable to watch. shot on location in england. well filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen, the 4:3 cropped image is horrible & cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen, this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on & the sense of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost. the acting is ok in a very silly film, patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud, nancy paul replaced olivia hussey, frank finlay replaced klaus kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine down.lifeforce is a bizarre film, no two ways about it really & anyone looking for something simple & straight forward should look elsewhere. anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci-fi genre than give lifeforce a go as it's one of those so bad it's good films with some impressive effects & it isn't your average run of the mill film by any means.

a terrific b-feature. a virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day, (you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play), and although only 77 minutes long, played out in sequences akin to something like real time. robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home. both are superb, especially the under-rated lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before ryan's unhinged intruder. today, of course, it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner, (much better known as an art director), only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock.

i particularly enjoyed delly's review of this film and agree that howard is not the only "damaged" character. howard is rather ruthlessly "set-up" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if she is, that he murdered her. howard doesn't know and neither do we. in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there, he bolts. however, he never actually harms helen gordon, no matter how enraged he is. indeed, he reacts with horror at helen's fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors...then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered helen with the almost pathetic " i'm very tired now. i think i'll go home". frankly, i don't think he's a psychopath. a sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath.the problem with howard is that he has no real male identity. he wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. he is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). and, he does a woman's job - "floor's are my speciality". helen's niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job. also, although he finds himself strongly attracted to helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. he is remarkably powerless - can't fight, can't work, can't make love.helen is justifiably terrified, however. she tries to connect to him but, finding that he doesn't respond normally (i.e. way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband ned), unwittingly presses all howard's buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape.both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neuroses, rage and memory, deserve sympathy. i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers, but i felt it fitted well, as it offered a kind of release to the characters. helen is freed, i think, from the past. when howard tries on her husband's army coat, helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. she no doubt feels that the "sacredness" of ned's possessions has been violated but, hopefully, her need to keep everything "untouched" has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. perhaps she can move on.howard is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger, hurt and violence. whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable, but i hope it's the former.great performances from ryan and lupino. i prefer "on dangerous ground", but this is pretty good too.

the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman. she is a war widow.the set is limited but the acting makes up for this. robert ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. at first lupino tries to help him. he seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. but how do we know? the suspense builds. i truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. what is this man capable of?. there are some scenes with o.z. whitehead and dee pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. we keep thinking she will be helped, then ryan's personality turns again. he becomes like a jekyll/hyde character and eventually chases lupino with a knife.worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.

beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase. he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier. the play dinelli wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season. it was dinelli's only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone. the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan. for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference. dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so i'm wondering what he thought about that. certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story.that wasn't the only thing that was eliminated. the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in. i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino's residence, i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era.the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino's home where she's hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman. the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference. it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day.both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made. films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best. if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story.

we are in a small town, a homely widow (ida lupino) hires a handyman (robert ryan) to look after her house. she soon starts to regret it as ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.beware, my lovely is adapted from mel dinelli's {the spiral staircase} story and play called "the man". pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness. one however shouldn't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture, because it isn't. it's clear from the get go that ryan's howard wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but this is a different sort of "peril" movie. one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.ryan and lupino are a great combination, they had also done the excellent, and far better, on dangerous ground this same year. so with both actors clearly comfortable together, it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house, re: prison. ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness, with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy. the direction from harry horner is safe {he in truth doesn't have to do much other than let his actors run with it} and george e. diskant's cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches. with one involving christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. falling some where in between being average and great, beware, my lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film-noir. for fans of robert ryan tho, it's something of an essential viewing, oh yes, and then some. 7/10

when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it. i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse. having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt. (my mother and brother had to do this)when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and i was impressed.

the movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv's early years. nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan. he wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful. but no one was better at wounded idealism (on dangerous ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure.lupino's problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next. the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. it's a nail-biter all the way. this is not one of lupino's many fine "soulful" parts that she was so good at. instead, it's a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough. my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting. ryan's already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him. then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive-looking ryan scrubbing the floor, she starts getting coy, flirting with her budding sexuality. sensing trouble, ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit. insulted, whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "women's work". that does it. up to that point he's been courteous and professional with lupino, trying to set himself on a normal path. but whiting has hit his raw nerve. now there's heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door, leaving lupino to pay the price. it's a riveting scene, expertly done.anyway, this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles. too bad. what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front. she deserves at least an honorary oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much.

my family watches this movie over and over. even our 3 year old loves it. i like the "goodness" in the movie. giving the stranger a chance...showing goodwill to one obviously in need of some unconditional acceptance. the movie gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. one other aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is the personalities of velvet's siblings. the bird lover. the bug lover. the boy lover! very cute and happy movie. there is one thing, however that is irritating about it. that is how mrs. brown often makes mr. brown look foolish or unwise. she, at times,comes off as a know it all, and he as a dimwit, which he is not. too bad to put that into such a nice story. nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old movie!

i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie: beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. watch this with your children, especially your young daughters- velvet brown is a wonderful role model for girls. this was one of my daughter's favorite films.the story is based on a best selling book by enid bagnold about a girl, velvet, whose whole life is her horse, pi, and about her single-minded pursuit of her "impossible" dream. i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first-time viewers. she lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village.this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star, and to watch the film is to understand why. she is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty- trusting, passionate, innocent- she is the emotional core of the movie.mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as mi, the young man who arrives on their doorstep one day, stays, and helps velvet train the pi. this is one of his finest performances. also standing out is anne revere as velvet's mother in an academy award winning role. her strong, loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams: "we're alike. i, too, believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life." i heartily recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age.

whenever ida lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. in this film as mrs. helen gordon,"high sierra",'41 along with robert ryan,(howard wilton),"golden gloves",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor mrs. gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection. if you liked ida lupino, who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman's prison and prison warden who was hated, this is the film for you to enjoy. i truly believe that ida lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry!!!

first, let me say that i find films like shawshank redemption and green mile, and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning. although, national velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe-worthy moments, i thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing and bawling throughout the film.the premise of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be, but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory. the characters have depth and grow throughout the story. ann revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an american film. her interaction with the good-hearted donald crisp is funny and sweet. while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than margaret o'brien (she succeeds btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer.this is far from a perfect movie. some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated (the kids' antics, and rooney's scenes at the track and in the pub for example) but it doesn't matter. the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid. we don't have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments - sometimes more is less. the final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in.strong understated performances, rounded characters, pithy dialog, intelligent and internally consistent storyline. we believe in the characters and are moved by their story. yup - they just don't make them like this any more...

national velvet (1944) the movie that put taylor on the map. costarring the then number one box office champ, mickey rooney. taylor plays a girl in love with her horse and when jockey mickey rooney is unable to ride in the grand national race, spunky liz cuts her hair, pretends to be a boy and races the horse to...well i won't spoil the end for you. it's quality melodrama that mgm was famous for putting out. and it's another early color picture to boot!

this is a delightful film. elizabeth taylor does a wonderful job, as does mickey rooney. the film just makes you feel happy. it's inspirational, and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental, that is easily forgiven. i could watch this movie again and again. the race at the end is exciting every time i see it. highly recommend this film.

this is the greatest movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream. elizabeth taylor is velvet and in her prime (of her childhood, at least), mickey rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go off to the grand national steeplechase with her beloved horse "the pi"--short for "pirate"--only to have velvet become the jockey and have a chance at victory. to those of you who have not seen it yet, i won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you do you'll love it. notice a very young angela lansbury as velvet's eldest sister.

i can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film, so i must be in the minority for liking this film so much. well, i am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). i guess i like it because i am a psychology teacher and i really liked the brooding character played by ryan. while he truly is dangerous as well as very menacing, you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. and wow did ryan do a really good job portraying this man! you really find yourself feeling for ida lupino as he destroys her life. so with such intense acting and menace, why is the movie rated relatively low? well, probably because it isn't exactly believable,...but boy is it entertaining and creative. give it a try and don't believe the score of 6.4--it's a lot better than that!

intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house (lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (ryan). the 2 masters of the genre are at their heady, erotic best as they match wits, emotions, and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the saturday evening post. richly hued b & w photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots. the young girl who teases ryan is really well directed here. improbable, but satisfying suburban melodrama.

beware, my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, harry horner, better known for his set designs. robert ryan plays a handyman who is hired by ida lupino to do some housework for her. the problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn't know it. miss lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win ryan over, to little avail. he is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. he suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. essentially the effect ryan has on lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer, but it takes lupino much longer. thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss lupino try everything in her power to 'win' ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. but getting on with things isn't in ryan's makeup, as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself. as a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive. what it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know lupino can't 'fix' ryan, yet we want her to. the result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure.horner shows us, gradually, the layout the lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. we become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows miss lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can't.

wildman head counselor tripper harrison (bill murray in peak nutty form in his first lead role) presides over the various wacky hi-jinks at north star summercamp. tripper befriends sad and lonely misfit kid rudy (a nice and affecting performance by chris makepeace). director ivan reitman relates the amusingly off the wall comic vignettes at a ceaseless snappy pace and maintains an engagingly good-natured tone throughout. this film astutely nails the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about the escaped psycho killer with the hook hand. the sense of gleefully raucous fun this picture generates is positively infectious. moreover, the humor is always goofy and occasionally gross, but never too nasty or mean-spirited. best of all, there's a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with said humor (the warm relationship between tripper and rudy in particular is genuinely touching). the cast have an obvious ball playing their likable characters: murray's gloriously gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy pa announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are sound contributions from harvey atkin as hapless camp owner morty, kate lynch as tripper's sassy old flame roxanne, russ banham as the amiable crockett, kristine debell as the sweet, foxy a.l., sarah torgov as the feisty candace, jack blum as klutzy bespectacled nerd spaz, keith knight as tubby slob larry finkelstein, cindy girling as the fetching wendy, and matt craven as the hip hardware. donald wilder's cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes nifty use of wipes. elmer bernstein's lively and melodic score likewise does the trick. a real riot.

... the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. it's a genial summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule. pranks do take place, but you get the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh, having been dopey enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end!it's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray. for me, he's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose. no one's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man, established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day. everything's silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good-natured fun. "meatballs" promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch.

i just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years...maybe close to 20. in some ways, it was better than i remembered...in other, it was much worse.first of all, there's the music. it's just plain awful. there are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. the opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-y title track is performed by rick dees. it doesn't get any worse than that. even the background music is terrible, with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes. we also get some truly lame slapstick, mostly in the opening credits.on the other hand, bill murray is spot on brilliant as usual...you have to wonder if he ad-libbed the whole thing, or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. or maybe he's just that great- turning a weak script into comic genius. the best part are his surreal pa announcements. ("lobsters...get out of here...you're a menace!")you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this. at least half the characters seem like real people...and mostly real people you would like to have around. even "spaz" gets to do a more than any other eddie deezen-type character ever did, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (she's not absurdly hot, but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls- see "revenge of the nerds" for examples of both cinematic phenomenons.)and when the plot seems clichéd...well, ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a cliché yet when they made this. while it wasn't the first summer camp movie- ya gotta go back at least to "the parent trap"- it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre. in fact, i was surprised that there was no talent show scene..."wet hot american summer" spoofed the summer-camp genre so perfectly, i just assumed everything in it came straight out of meatballs. (i also half-expected jon cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp, thanks to "mr. show's" epic camp-olympiad spoof "monk academy") anyway, this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late-70's/early 80's comedies- it's not a cable staple anymore, and certainly doesn't have the cult following of caddyshack or animal house. i was pleased to catch it on showtime today- and in high definition at that! sure, it's pretty awful in spots, but you could do a lot worse in a 70's/80's teen comedy. and again, murray is a genius.

yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. but add in bill murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.it does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. when you hear the title "meatballs", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. the sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of "a christmas story", which i also love. the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. the only movie i've seen that comes close, is "indian summer", which i like almost as much as "meatballs", and also stars matt craven. let's hope he completes the trilogy. maybe he could come back for "return of the meatballs", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic)."meatballs" is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). it's a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile.

camp north star and it's camp counselor extraordinaire, tripper harrison(bill murray)sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival camp mohawk, an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend. meanwhile, we watch as tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor roxanne(kate lynch)as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head-over-heels. the film comes to head at the camp olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year. the film also shows the growing bond between tripper and a quietly lonely, puppy-dog eyed rudy(chris makepeace of "vamp" fame), whose dad is often away all the time. rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with tripper or taking his peanuts at blackjack. the film mostly contains hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around.you have hottie counselors, total nerd spaz(jack blum)with his taped glasses and bad acne, beak-nosed "hardware"(matt craven)who likes to blow things up, fat kid fink(keith knight) who is often stuffing his face, amongst others in the film. there's a basketball game where poor spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival camp mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor fink tossing underhanded, between-his-knees fly-balls that sail over the back-board. there's camp fire coupling(with a spirited scary tale by tripper about a hook-handed killer)and boys drooling over the lovely ladies.yes, i know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality(such as the scenes with a sad makepeace and murray), but just as much as this recent viewing, i found myself giggling away. i'm licked and just can't help loving this. it's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. i can't explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that floods forth when i see a sleepy murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin. his intercom jokes are especially amusing. but, the flick is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with murray dead-panning endlessly..not that there's anything wrong with that. the film, though, couldn't quite survive without him, could it? hard to even think of this movie without murray in the lead. it's a happier time and i think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown-ups still connect with "meatballs" warmly. and, poor morty(harvey atkin), the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth, and to beat camp mohawk for a change, is the constant source of tripper and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him..especially when he's sleeping on his bed! great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us.

this is easily the best of the summer camp movies. in fact, few of the others are even fair, let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this one is. the film is just simply out to have some good, clean, fun. many people who went to summer camp as kids will see that it is presented here faithfully to the way it usually was, but with slapstick comedy mixed in. bill murray, as the chief counselor of the camp, tripper, leads a fine ensemble cast, and is usually at the center of the riotous nonsense. tripper has great one-liners throughout, usually broadcasting his jokes as pseudo-announcements over the camp's public-address system.several great supporting actors played the campers and counselors to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots, all the while sprinkled amongst the many incidents of camp hi-jinx. spaz (jack blum) and fink (keith knight) were two characters particularly well done. the adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. each has classic lines, and they are characters you like and root for. look for spaz in the scene of disco dance pandemonium.the girls in the story are realistic characters, too. they're not dumb, naive, freakish, oversexed, nervy, or any of the other overused, abominable teen character stereotypes. kristine debell, kate lynch, cindy girling, and others make these characters believable. the requisite pranks abound, usually at the expense of camp director morty (harvey atkin). the nature of these pranks start at outrageous and progress from there. however, with all the silliness going on, tripper and the others have their serious sides. for example, tripper befriends a shy, lonely kid, rudy(chris makepeace), and takes him under his wing.the story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp. it's a great "root for the underdogs" finale. when the chips are down, tripper's motivational "it just doesn't matter" spiel is inspired, and one of the best moments in the movie. and get ready to root: "spaz. spaz! spaz!!!""

seeing this movie always reminds me of what i remember summer being like, god! such a long time ago. the entire scene involving the "overnight", from the canoe procession to the end of the trip, is precious, and tripper's story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth. a highly entertaining movie, made many times better by the awful sequels that followed.

"here on earth" is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about samantha who has both boy problems and health problems. as her love for her current boyfriend, jasper, fades away, her love for kelley blooms like a new spring flower. i found this movie very touching, very warm, very romantic, and touching. i enjoyed every bit of this movie...and that's pretty rare! i highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers! this is one film you don't want to miss!!! :dby the way...if you're a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies, bring tissues!!! on the other hand, it was a really really good movie!!! very romantic...and surprisingly good!!! :d

alright, i'm 12, so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre-teen's point of view. i've also commented on magnolia and bicentennial man, both great movies, if you want to check it out. alright, here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. the writer (i don't know who it was, check imdb) either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love, poetry, and drama. i cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for over 30 minutes. it was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. it's a great movie for anyone, say, 11 and up who isn't a romantic-comedy freak. yeah, it's romantic, yeah, it's comedic, but (in my opinion), it's better than "she's all that" or "whatever it takes". i never cry! it's a tender story. go rent it and tape it :).

i don't understand why critics would bash this movie. it's a teen movie that's actually serious, which is a rarity. i'll admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy, but c'mon it's about young love, it's gotta be sappy to be valid. my biggest complaint is chris klein. while he was funny in american pie, he apparently isn't ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet, he's very uncomfortable looking in some of his "mama stuff". hartnett and sobieski on the other hand, demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability, as do the parent's. although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry, the actor's make it work. the directing sports some powerful images on the screen. beautiful cinematography, nice music, great young actors, i was impressed and i'm a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies.

all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb. you are going to cry when you see this. i mean, this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss. even though i am still a teen, this is how i live my life. when i am with that certain someone, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. so, i give this movie a 10 for it's heartfelt message and touching plot. actors josh hartnett and chris klein i also give a 10 for having a cute face.

this is a very unusual film which starts out with a rich dude getting a brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take it for a spin in the local town. rich boy meets poor girl in 'mabels diner'who is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out. there is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the rich boy and poor boy wind up having to do community service as ordered by the town judge. rich boy and poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend. there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. poor girl says, "some people go through life and never find love, i can say that i found love and am holding on to it". you will need some tissue's if you are sensitive, there are plenty of romantic scenes and i doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end. the producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film. if you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your film.

one of the message boards threads at imdb had two women talking about colin firth, how they watched the movie only because of him. obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally. the brilliant, and i mean brilliant, performances by michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange were hardly noticed, not only by audiences, but by the academy and by most of the critics.i think i know why. first, the plot--or actually just the setup--is a kind of bastardization of shakespeare's king lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit. their names even begin with the same letters, regan, goneril, and cordelia--rose, ginny, and caroline. and i guess "larry" (jason robards) works for "lear." the apparent idea envisioned by jane smiley in her pulitzer prize winning novel was to tell a lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the bard. the problem is, in smiley and moorhouse's story, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities. his only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it.the second problem--and this is one i cannot personally attest to, not having read smiley's novel--is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. still, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen. the vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist. given five or six hours, perhaps moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with smiley's novel.a third problem is one that is perhaps moorhouse's alone. she began her directing career with the very well done aussie film proof (1991) starring russell crowe. she follow it up with how to make an american quilt (1995) which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. however it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick. in a sense a thousand acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. larry cook is clearly a bad, bad daddy. he beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them. he ran the household with an iron fist. jess (colin firth's character) seduces the inexperienced ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear. and then he goes to rose, who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership, and hooks up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. the rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, the way they often appear in romance novels. i think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story.having said all this, i think the critics and the public are wrong. i think the direction was biased against men, but in this story it needed to be. i think moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty. and the acting by pfeiffer and lange was nothing short of sensational. they seemed to feed off of one another in a way that i found absolutely authentic and deeply moving. in particular pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent-up anger and hatred. the way moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to pfeiffer's outstanding performance. and the skill with which moorhouse guided the change in ginny's character as she went from a "ninny," as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. the fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else. he needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back. and robards in his intensity and madness was also very good.i predict that this film, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on dvd. my question is, whatever happened to moorhouse? her talent is obvious, but she has yet to director her fourth feature film. when she does i hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well. i think, actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film, but didn't pay enough attention to the others. in addition to the unnuanced father, jennifer jason leigh's caroline was unfinished, leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did. and the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins. they needed to be engaged and involved.

i like this movie. i may be biased because i love dolphins. however, my 3 and 4 yr. old will sit and watch the whole movie.... it's not oscar material, but definitely entertaining. the dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. my favorite scene is when flipper "flips" the pop can out of the water striking sandy in the head. it's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time. on the other hand, the villainous banterings of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a little hard to take. and the shark scene is far from reality. question: do dolphins really make that much noise? or is there some serious dubbing happening here? bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our vcr.

flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family. it's obviously not a great movie, free willy looks much better almost in every component of film making. possibly, at times it becomes a bit naive , and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie, but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. elijah wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. he can make bad movie watchable, okay movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all time classic. paul hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role. as i already say above, whole cinematography was very good. but underwater shots definitely is the best parts. so flipper is a perfect way if you want to see nice, sweet and entertaining movie. if you like me become sick and tired of modern hollywood trash, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity you most likely would like this movie. my rating: 7,7 out of 10. feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here. sorry for my bad english.

i thought this was a beautiful movie- very brave. such beautiful imagery-and i liked the use of breaking glasses w/ applause. also how the best friend repeated the line about "..and she's one year older than me.." showed that their friendship has rekindled and grown, but maybe some competition is left...i loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric. the dance concert was beautiful. the beginning seemed slow, though..it took awhile to feel for the characters-the husband could have been more abusive-he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him-it didn't really fit. the affair btwn. the best friend and husband seemed random..the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left(to live..) so when the infidelity was revealed, i didn't feel as much sympathy for the character-more like relief! the ending was so great- the lines btwn. her and the husband, and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant!

this is one of a very few movies with terrific acting, wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch. it is about changes in life. it is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. it is about accepting oneself and others. it is about life challenges. it is about coming to term with reality. it is about courage. it is about love. both actresses are very true to their role. the actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie. this is the key of the movie that made the movie. it is rare to see an independent film like this one. one could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie. i wish to see more movie from this producer/writer. see the movie, you will love it.

i just saw this film in austin texas at the austin gay and lesbian film festival and it was my festival favorite. the gymnast is a film not to be missed. it is an honest "coming to terms" story about relationships, self discovery , growing older and having the courage to change and move forward. not only is this a good story but the glorious aerialist performances by dreya weber and addie yungmee will take your breath away! see this film! it will be coming soon to a festival near you. this film deserved to be picked up right away by a major network or studio. i will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on dvd.

wow what can i say it was a good movie, very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when jane left her husband im guessing she was going to serena cause she fell for her,not just her but everything that she is,i so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending i really hate it when they do that. the aerial acts looked like fun but i guess you'd have to be light and muscly, i would like to see more movies like this one, maybe the could do a sort of sequel of jane and serena.if i were in jane's shoes i would have went for the girl too she was attractive.

...this one. what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle, as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject. we simply observe as the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to confront any "moral" issues (or of course we are, but are not spoon-fed them). sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed. basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sexes.i personally found the girls having a good chemistry, and had fun with them on their night outs. the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of...retained. held back. it's not about the sex scenes (or those missing), but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time, it kind of contrasted with the rest. lowkey is good, but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle, nor touched me quite as much.this said, i heartily recommend it, it's by no means a waste of ones precious time, on the contrary...7/10

this movie was beautiful and touching. it touched a place deep inside me and i'm not sure why. i am a happily married woman and i've never had lesbian tendencies, but my, this movie almost made it something i crave. the choreography, the storyline, the dialog... the movie was a work of art. the synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast unsatisfied with her life and looking for... something, anything. she is with a man who does not want a baby, but she does. he's not mean to her, but he doesn't treat her the way a woman should be treated either... i guess he doesn't really appreciate her. all these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym. she meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years, and they have stayed close friends.the relationship that unfolds is.. i don't know quite the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy... something that could only exist between two women. the kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. someone that makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused even.the relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way. they have a close and intimate relationship. her friend showed me what a true friend really is. someone who is understanding, easy going, real, fun to be with, someone who is there for you no matter what. someone who is supportive, and you can huddle with and tell your deepest secrets. someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. the story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone, but not underdone in any way. it leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it's moments. the dancing and choreography was stunning. i could watch it over and over. the way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was. the dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch. what a cozy a wonderful story! i fell in love with this movie. if you have a chance, rent this and watch it!!

"the gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes, revealing its characters and message over time. the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are.the spare approach is also its drawback; there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context. there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials. i'm glad i did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well- rounded understanding of the film overall.aside from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. the shooting was very tastefully done; very matter-of-fact. one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic sleaze film. the physicality of the athletes -- their realness -- is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot.not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon, since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.

everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time. the acting, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything was top notch. as an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), i was so unbelievably pleased by this film. it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board. hearing the q&a with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important. and the writer did a hell of a job, as well as directing and the editing was awesome. thanks so much for making a great film! thanks also for the line about 'if you're going to slap a label on yourself, it would be bisexual'. i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight, it's wonderful to see bisexuals getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community, and it was nice that labels weren't even necessary at all in this film. what an ending! just when i thought it couldn't give me more, it did. beautiful work and my applauds to all. i will spread the word, this is definitely a film not to be missed!

the gymnast (2006) was written and directed by ned farr. dreya weber portrays jane hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist.the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. although this meeting takes place, that plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named serena (addie yungmee). the two women develop an act of the type performed by cirque de soleil. the two complement each other--jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats.the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to addie, who is caring and compassionate, while jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage.both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. they clearly are truly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed, be a success in las vegas, or anywhere else they traveled.the sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation, which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion.of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival, we thought this one was the best. it will work on dvd, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. note: stay for the credits!

thankyou for making such a wonderful escape . that's what i love about movies. i'm so impressed with the aireals , the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music .being a dancer myself , and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped ,diced and sometimes not even to the beat....."showgirls" the movie . the relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement .my favorite scene is the last one, when she is pulled over . i've seen the movie before, a different version ., and i disliked the husband more last time . i felt a little more sorry for him this time . it changes how i feel about the female love birds. its all so magical .

whatever you do, don't stop watching when you think the movie is over! hang around for the first batch of credits or you'll really miss something! we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch. dreya weber is a marvel really, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it off so far above the ground. at the q&a she said there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is really her going for it. addie couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna. she was excellent and, my gawd, so beautiful. i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd, but there you have it, savannnah isn't a backwater.

somehow, somewhere, someplace.. you gotta see this film. breath taking aerials, and incredible outstanding performances from highly gifted actors.you think cirque du soleil blows your mind,wait till you see what these 2 women do - most importantly, the emotional journey and struggles jane(dreya weber) faces are universal in theme to many women. a superbly directed film which deals with the complexities of relationships,and holding on, until you're ready to let go. this masterpiece will touch women and men alike. ned far (director/writer) and ridiculously talented dreya weber (star/producer) just had the guts to tell it, honestly and sincerely. this film will hit big - see it however you can - or you won't be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most talked about films.

now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life, when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy, but this film really spoke to me. jane is an everywoman: although she has so many positive things going for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. she is strong and intelligent, but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life. she seeks out new challenges and happiness, seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart. dreya weber is an exquisite jane. as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her desperation and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production. allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing. i highly recommend this film; although it's low budget, it has big budget writing and production values. ps- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. women will love the story and characters, but there's something for the men here, too. :)

this film tackles the subjects of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artful, sensitive, and visually stunning way that i was completely transported. it is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. you'll have to see for yourself. dreya weber (jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality, in a way that every woman will relate to. i found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging. there was nothing in this film that said to me "low budget" as far as quality is concerned. nothing. the fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. the final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off. it is a brilliant celebration of jane's choice. unexpected and inspiring.

the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic. how the two end up involved is believable. it doesn't have that whole "oh yeah right" that most hollywood movies have. not too mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of trapeze. i am a trapeze student and i love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal! definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. i loved it! i'm happy with the way the movie ended but i definitely wanted to see more. be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treat hehe. great scene!

i truly enjoyed this film. it's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. the film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. and yet the approach wasn't heavy handed. the production values were also top notch for a small budget film. i saw this at the philadelphia gay & lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. it was a real crowd pleaser. everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film.

definitely not only for urban legend aficionados, campfire tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories. it is also a film that exceeded the (low) expectations i had. a horror film i had never heard or read about, a straight-to-video release (granted, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing), a cast of mostly unknowns... well, i'll leave the math to you.the film proves to be an entertaining, suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience. the four stories are well-paced and satisfying. the only one i felt was a little weaker was "the locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters' actions; however, i still loved the tale, its atmosphere and ending. my favorite one was the third story, "people can lick too" - the suspense in it is not only palpable, but also educational.i found campfire tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance, and then goes on recommending it to everyone.7/10

i saw this movie late at night on a free-to-air channel, and i must say, i was pleasantly surprised. being a horror movie fan, i often watch these sort of midnight movies during the school holidays. more often than not, the horror movies shown during this time are usually big lamers. 'campfire tales' certainly does not fit into that category.campfire tales is basically an anthology of short stories based loosely on well-known urban legends. they are pieced together with a setting involving teenagers telling these stories around a campfire. this campfire setting has a mysterious plot in itself. however, this particular story is weak and confusing, obviously used predominantly to set up the other spooky tales.there are three tales in this movie (four if you count 'the hook' at the beginning), all of which are truly spooky and well-made. i especially enjoyed the third tale ('the locket') involving a guy whose motorbike breaks down in front of a mysterious household. this particular story works well in really freaking you out with sudden flashbacks of the house's history. in addition to this, the ending of the tale will completely shock you! the first tale ('the honeymoon') was also very creepy, though the second tale ('people can lick too') was somewhat lacking.being a horror movie veteran, i don't usually get freaked out. this film certainly did that job well! what i particularly liked about this movie is the fact that it's split up into three shorts. this means the movie won't plod through an hour or so of character development and setting establishment before the real bloodshed begins. that makes 'campfire tales' perfect for sleepovers, parties, etc.campfire tales is a creepy, crisp horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. it's certainly better than the crap you'll often find in the cinemas these days (blair witch 2, urban legends: final cut...bleah!). find a copy and watch it...if you dare!

i originally posted the first user comment on this movie,and claimed it was crap and it didnt make sense.i didnt make sense. campfire tales is a thoroughly enjoying film (now that im 2 years older and watched it last night).the actors were famous but not too famous. the acting itself was more than acceptable,it was rather good.i will rate the movie per segment of films.1)the black and white scene (a.k.a-"the hook") this one was rather pointless,it looked good,but didnt hold much grip at all,the only disappointing one,i dont think it was even included as a segment.here is the scare-o-meter.------(poor)2)the r.v story (honeymooners stuck in woods) possibly the most entertaining of all tales,the acting was good in this one too,dissapointing bout the typical caravan sex scenes.yet it was intruiging,you think "who was knocking on that door".it had suspense,and not too gory.liked this one--------------------------(very good)3)internet chat tale (little girl meets psycho) this was a smart addition,gore left at a minimal,frights left at extreme.although dull at times,the last few minutes were most entertaining,dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch.real creepy,and could happen to anybody,so watch who youre talking to.---------------------------(very good)4)ghost tale (man kisses ghost)?? not the best,it wasnt too atmospheric for a ghost tale.this one was strange,the aspects were rather good,playing music and the screaming,but everything was too real to be ghastly,although it was good,it was quiet bloody,and could have been better with that idea.-------------(acceptable)5)the ending (the 4 lost teenagers) these are the 2 attractive gals and guys telling the tales through-out the film.the best thing about the film is definantley the ending,it set a great impression,the ending was totally un-expected.watch it,it was so well done,the realism was spectacular.-----------------------------------(top notch)6)the film overall campfire tales was more than i used to take it for,i actually like it so much now im buying it on video,cause its a truly entertaining horror movie forget the trash you see these days,like many,im dissapointed that this didnt really go nowhere,it was straight to video,to me it was better than all the hype "horror" you see these days. overall for campfire tales----------------------------- (very good)8 out of 10

i would like to say that i absolutely loved campfire tales! to me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. as if the contents of the movie weren't scary or weird enough, you have the ending. it's a very awesome movie and i'm so happy that it's being released on dvd on august 30th.i will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.i don't think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge, but if it weren't for my brother telling me about the movie, i wouldn't have known. which stinks because in my opinion it's far better than any "scream", "i know what you did last summer", or any other horror for that time. so i hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. i loved it, and being a horror movie junkie, campfire tales was like dessert for me!

while driving in a dangerous zigzag manner on a lonely road in the night, the teenager cliff (jay r. ferguson) has a car accident with his friends lauren (christine taylor), alex (kim murphy) and eric (christopher masterson). while spending the cold night stranded in the woods around a campfire, they kill time telling ghost stories. in "the honeymoon", the couple rick (ron livingston) and valerie (jennifer macdonald) travels in their rv to las vegas in their honeymoon. rick takes a shortcut to visit the clayton caverns in the night, but the stranger cole (hawthorne james) advises them to leave the spot since dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon. in "people can lick too", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, amanda (alex mckenna) tells her internet friend jessica that she is alone at home. however, jessica is actually a psychopath. in "the locket", the biker scott (glenn quinn) is crossing the country on his motorcycle. when he has a problem with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the gorgeous dumb heather wallace (jacinda barrett) lives with her father. when the man returns from his herd, scott finds the truth about heather."campfire tales" presents three good horror tales, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist in the end. the weakest segment is "the hook", with eddie and jenny, but the other stories a great. the plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above average horror movie. my vote is seven.title (brazul): "contos da meia-noite" ("midnight tales")

i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago. the vhs print was a little faded looking, but i was very haunted by what i had watched. did it all make sense? well, honestly, no it didn't. however, this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects. the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression.well, when i found out that anchor bay had released this oddity on dvd, i picked it up immediately. i was very pleased by the transfer, though i felt the extras rather lacking. though the film concerns the "o" and sir stephen characters, it really has nothing to do with pauline reage's original novel or the 1974 film the story of o. however, the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind. "o" decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong. her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men. naturally, sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress. however, the tables are turned when "o" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. suddenly, sir stephen feels the threat...i feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really make this film a classic. the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of "o"'s fellow brothel mates, but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored. like the political setting, the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging. no one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. (however, "o" does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer). one prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk, naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog. another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. she cannot let that vision go. she treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. as for "o", she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. when he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. of course, in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father. i was very, very disturbed by this image. i truly felt for "o" at this point in the film. she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why. her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love. another curious aspect of the film is the young child (that ages at the end) that sells fortune in a box. it is a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. at one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. now, if that isn't symbolism for you! (laugh) all in all, i really love this film. i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. it has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant to arouse. like the lives of the characters, the sex acts are empty. they are motions, but lack feeling and tenderness. (once again, the only tender scene is between "o" and the young man). "o" believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, however, she finds in the end that she has choices. she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness, however, she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew. the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions, however, some things don't need answers. the viewer will make the judgment that works for them. i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary. i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later. it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released. this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score. there is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine. i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music.

i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form. i especially loved david boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy. the first part of the movie was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic but interesting - and it was all downhill from there.i found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls (keira and lisa) get out of the blackmail&betrayal scot free, nary a trace left on their psyche. i know the movie amended the darker ending of the play - and i am not saying i missed the murder part. but i surely needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and i was left groaning in frustration with the ending. (it's why i gave it only a 9)but definitely an interesting film.

finding the premise intriguing, and reading the reviews, and being an angel fan, i watched this movie. it's sexy and original, and quite entertaining. david boreanaz is keith. he's a hunky married man, stay at home dad, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. he makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man. they'll do anything to get into his bed, including beg, lie, and blackmail, but they mostly try to push his buttons. the nuttiness that ensues sends keith reeling, and pushes friendships to the edge. david boreanaz shows a little skin in this one-- and he's looking hot. yes-he plays a sleazy cheat - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end. one more thing, when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..yeah!!", it's hard to see them as a victim of rape.

this is a great movie. i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it (mainly for caroline dhavernas) it grew on me.it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls/young women are not punished for their sexuality. the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions.some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes - which were not over the top or distasteful. the male characters in the movie were brilliant - david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk - and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much. the other two younger male characters were good too, without being overbearing.this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them.

i am really amazed how little fame this film had. i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc.don't be idiots - if you are looking for a good fun take this movie - this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great.it's about ..... well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they?? it's nice and cute and gives good time . the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable.why i gave it only a 9? well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on. in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable. small spoiler: the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him. now i am not talking about some small cry but- no - hysteric cry and 30 sec after that the father goes out and "baby is sleeping"- excuse me , when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama - it's fun and this should be overlooked.

my friends and i rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about. we all thought it would be like "a canadian american pie" but when we watched it we were completely surprised, we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it! it was nothing like american pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore (seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie for not only it's plot but the actors and the great writing. there wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable. everything is very realistic and relate-able for anybody living in a small town with little prospects. i absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance, it's worth it.

this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly. each of the three "teenage girls" offer their own believable, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa. if one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, keith's character treated lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion. david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely. the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled. although the movie appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desire.

i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie "these girls" at the philadelphia film festival. going into the movie, i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting. so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down."these girls" is the story about three best friends from a small town. keira (caroline dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do. lisa (holly lewis) will be going away to a christian school after the summer. and finally, glory (amanda walsh) who plans on spending her summer babysitting. but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark (david boreanaz) the sexy older hunk who they baby-sit for. fun times and a lot of laughs ensue i normally don't like movies like "these girls" but there is something about this movie that i really liked. i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic. three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later. it's a pretty funny tale about growing up, friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy i can see majority of this film happening in real life.the subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the united states. all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16. now in the usa even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies won't finance a film like this because of the sexual content. this information was actually confirmed by the director himself john hazlett at the q&a after the film. the thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor. not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life. go figure.what the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters. i liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "now & then" characteristic to them. the jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top. everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama. the script was very strong.the acting was very good for the most part. i thought all the three girls were great. caroline dhavernas who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time "wonderfalls" was just terrific; as well as holly lewis and amanda walsh who both did a fine job as well. david boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes. the guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role.i had the pleasure of meeting john hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film. i am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. i think with a little marketing behind it, it could have taken off. sadly it's going to be one of these direct to dvd films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see. i think with what little budget mr. hazlett had to work with, the film turned out well and i think he did a fine job directing this little gem.for someone who typically hates teen sex comedies i can honestly say i really enjoyed this film. the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused. this is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it. i know i will be sure to buy this film when it comes on dvd on may 16, 2006. if you're a fan of coming of age stories, teen sex comedies, or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years.moviemanmenzel's final rating for "these girls" is an 8/10.

i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from (one of?) the executive producer at the atlantic film festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us.filmed in atlantic canada, the movie is about three teen-aged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth, devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30-year old man, despite much protestation.it's definitely worth a watch, but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit (male 18-25), so i was shaking my head at the character's antics rather than laughing. inspite of this, the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining, without so much laughing.

this film is outstanding! on this date of apr, 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time. it had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in. at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked, with a wife that seems close to going her own way. the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool. paulina porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot. trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry, paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron eckhart was cool at first, and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business. then he spots nicks silver briefcase, and the day changes for the weird and violent. there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. but, paulina's dallas steals the show i think. her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application, is outrageous. as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy,but as with any rule there are exceptions. paulina is as one has never seen her before in films. sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with tom selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence. if your looking for film to add to your collection, this one is worth the price. paulina in the nude is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one might hope one has. love,friendship,sex and violence in a terrific mix. when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind, and i know you will feel the same way.

very tightly written, acted, and filmed. violent, but not too much so. whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. there isn't a wasted scene in this movie. "the usual suspects" was superb ensemble acting; this is a collection of outstanding individual performances. i rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.

i watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. the best of the best. it was never any dull and always moving, every hour there's another character bothering (trying to kill) him. you never know what's next. in one word terrific !!!

truly a great film... i stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because aaron eckhart (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors) was in it as well as paulina porizcova... the lovely former si swimsuit model does get nude in the film, but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it... it's very exciting, and the character development is fantastic... eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working, and he steals this film... it is very dark and violent, but i enjoyed in immensely....

i saw this movie yesterday. i must admit - i love it! it's like early tarantino, but better. really a must, but... don't show this movie to anyone younger than 18. it's full of blood and sex (rape scene is great :) ). now i'm just waiting for other movies of this director and a dvd release.

i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released, but it slipped by them unnoticed. it is well written, witty, satirical, and thoroughly enjoyable. it's like a video game brought to life. you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next. the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect.one last word: for you mickey rourke fans...the mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end.

i saw this movie by accident while in paris. i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn't a preview or a short film, i was hooked. paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting. i can't say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal. the rest of the cast performs very well too. don't get me wrong, this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression.finally, not speaking french in france paid off for once! i didn't stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it.

i turned over to this film in the middle of the night and very nearly skipped right passed it. it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it. in the end, i thought it was great.an interesting storyline, good characters, a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch. this was, in fact, the first i'd heard of this movie, but i would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema.my imdb rating : 8 out of 10

how 'thursday' managed to avoid attention remains a mystery. a potent mix of comedy and crime, this one takes chances where tarantino plays it safe with the hollywood formula. the risks don't always pay off: one character in one sequence comes off inappropriately silly and falls flat. in the lead role, thomas jane gives a wonderful and complex performance, and two brief appearances by mickey rourke hint at the high potential of this much under- and mis-used actor. here's a director one should keep one's eye on.

this movie was excellent from start-to-finish. i was riveted by the action, the black humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn. thomas jane is a great actor and i hope to see him in many more movies to come. reading through other people's comments, i have to admit i never once thought about tarrantino while watching "thursday" but now that i think about it i guess there are some similarities. i guess i don't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else. the rape scene between porizkova and thomas jane is one for the record books - sexiest scene ever.

i loved this film! fantastically original and different! a solid, intense, hard-core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of (dark?) humor. if you're tired of the typical, overdone, ridiculous hollywood b.s. movies, how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take, then this film is for you. fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and solid performances by all actors, not a weak character or performance in the film. skip woods' film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts, his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film (not a bad mix at all in my opinion). this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film. the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it, everyone i've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it. this film is a welcomed change/alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today, even with their big name actors, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. it's a terrifically wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw (i mean that in a good way, no phony hollywood polish here) ride. thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen, you did an incredible job!

is thursday an original film? heck no, but it is a lot of fun! i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick. i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes (i really liked the first seen at the convenience store), some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well. some good performances from young actors, paulina porizkova was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron eckhart (who has gone on to impress me further in yours friends and neighbours' and erin brokovich'). so if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out thursday'.

very violent and nicely filmed movie. paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too. this movie has lots of black humor. this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster. there will be sometimes when you wouldn't know whether to shiver or to smile and think "am i laughing at someone who is killing people?"

i love the premise, but it's replay value is only for certain parts(the opening scene of course). some characters are a bit outrageous, but they are entertaining none the less. i think the ballping sh-t was pushing it. i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle, i just think that the flashback's story could have been better. also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining, but once again i think the story was told sloppy. it really seems unbelievable. i actually believe swordfish (the other movie woods has written) more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sh-t a secret all the time, and has organizations set up that the public will never know about.thursday is the best quentinesque movie i've seen. i think woods is imaginative,clever and has witt; however, his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script (not stone's movie) level. how old is he anyway?

i was referred to this movie by a friend. i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher lampbert so i rented it, and come to find out that wasn't christopher lampbert it was thomas jane who was great it this film. i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie. in my book thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the thursday. this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane. but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood video's on vhs. so dust off the old vcr and pop in thursday because it gets pee wee's seal of approval

thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since quentin tarantino took the genre by storm with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film. thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location. it works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable, and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller. there is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. the plot follows casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife. the pair wants to adopt a child, but things turn awry when casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime, nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal...the first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. we see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments. the scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. thursday is a very funny film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike. it's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. the acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. thomas jane holds the film together well in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from james legros, paulina porizkova, michael jeter, glenn plummer and mickey rourke back him up nicely. this film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances; thursday is likely to suffice.

hey community! my question is about the song, the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed. not his "ragga application song" but the cozy one! thanks this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment. i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing.hey community! my question is about the song, the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed. not his "ragga application song" but the cozy one! thanks this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment. i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing.

we are taken to a convenience store where nick is looking at coins in his hand figuring if he can get the special, a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry. he decides to go for the larger size, which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't qualify him for the cake. he tries to argue with the indian clerk at the register, who keeps her ground. with her it's a matter of principle. well, nick gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her. the tone of the story is set from the start. the people we are about to meet are not nice guys. there are nick, his girlfriend, dallas, and their partner billy hill. they are drug dealers. nick decides to visit casey, his friend, and former partner in crime, in houston. he wants to do one more transaction and then go to paris with the profits from selling the drugs he is bringing. what he doesn't realize is that casey has gone straight. he is an architect, married to christine, and wants to adopt a baby.casey doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house. he decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing them down the kitchen drain. the untimely arrival of ice, a pizza delivery man, takes casey by surprise. this man has been sent to kill him, but before that, casey brings out some weed to share with ice, who has a talent for rapping.it is at this point that dr. jarvis, the man from the adopting agency, arrives. casey's application shows a two year gap that he can't justify. jarvis begins to doubt about the prospective father. at this time, dallas makes an entrance. she is a woman that asks questions point blank, like when she demands to know whether jarvis enjoys watching porn. jarvis, who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff. dallas has decided to seduce casey at all costs. there is a surprise in store as billy hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees, shooting dallas in the process. billy hill has also come to off casey, but he is overpowered.casey gets the visit of kasarov who wants to get his money from nick; in his absence, he'll take it from casey. kasarov gives a deadline and casey makes up his mind to outsmart all these low lives. he has all the parties come to his house at an appointed hour and the different factions will take care of themselves. in the end, casey has a better plan that includes taking christine for a stay in paris.never having heard about "thursday" we were drawn into it because of the talent in it. skip woods directed his own material. this seems to be a film with good intentions. at times the film remember others of the same genre, not a sin by any shape, or form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here in the imdb site. for starters, "thursday" shows a witty skip woods that has gone to write other films, notably, "swordfish". the screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles, pertaining to the action. denis lenoir does wonders with the mostly interior photography. thomas jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his casey. although hard to imagine, he has beat the odds and made something out of himself. this actor, seen recently in the television series "hung", is one of the actors we don't tire of watching. a dark haired aaron eckhart is a welcome addition to any film. he is a greasy criminal that shows no redeeming qualities, or anything close to remorse and doesn't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. james legros has nothing to do. same goes for paulina porizkova, a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction, or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. we enjoyed glenn plummer, who appears as ice. he does a mean audition on the telephone. michael jeter and mickey rourke also appear.

this movie is excellent. not because it does anything special or new, but because it is consistently great in all of its parts. no part stands out as being "ground-breaking" or "stellar", but all parts are far above mediocre, and that makes, to me, an excellent movie.i own several copies of this movie, and may acquire it on collectors dvd or blu-ray, someday (holding off right now due to high blu-ray prices, and of course the face that i don't have a blu-ray player... but that's beside the point of this review).it stars off sort of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters, and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end.wait, no, it does not start out ordinary.it starts out sort of like what a qun. tar. movie wishes it could be. with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes... very, very wrong.by the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and a few people are dead, and a few people are very rich. i won't tell you who... watch and enjoy! overall rating: 10/10, a**, excellent!

i think that never been kissed was a totally awesome movie. the casting was really good and they acted very well. i really like drew barrymore and of course for me it was excellent. i was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video. boy, am i happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie. go see it if you already haven't!

it doesn't matter whether drew or leelee are total babes, but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy. this movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for "real" people. it made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. this movie represents the real world and that what really matters.

drew barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies. she stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes. romantic comedies like this suit her and i believe that she's done her best so far. check out her other romantic comedies. you'll see what i mean.

after seeing this movie, i came to the realization that drew barrymore is a great actress. this movie wouldn't have been watchable without drew. the fact that somebody as attractive as drew, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was "josie grossie". her attempts to "transition" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club.we also had snl favorite, molly shannon, playing a great part as anita, josie's best friend. one of the funniest scenes in the movie was anita trying to teach the class sex ed. this was one of mollys funniest performances and best.leelee sobieski also had a great part and i really felt for her, because i know people like her that got tortured like that.this movie is a must see for drew barrymore fans, because drew makes the movie.

women will like this movie better than men. of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit, however i considered this a 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and about a 6.5 for the next 40% and about a 9 for the last 10%. so, begrudgingly, i will rate it a 7. i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse - at least that's my objective. i have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs.my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me, though i'm not sure why. i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is.the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school (undercover) to write a story about the high school experience nowadays. she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around. her journey toward cooldom, as well as her falling in love with a teacher, is the story.what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked. i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog. so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. argh! naturally, she transformed into a rather attractive (cute) woman by the end and she became very popular.the ending is about a 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so you sappers out there will like that. otherwise, it isn't very memorable and easily missable.

i just saw this movie for the second time with my 8-year-old daughter and i remembered why we liked it the first time. all these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical! it is simply an entertaining little movie, it's not supposed to change the world. i thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (except for jeremy jordan as guy--he was a maggot who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo. if he is supposed to be the hot guy in their school, then they've got slim pickins'.) but i digress--drew barrymore was delightful, as usual, and david arquette was even enjoyable, and i usually can't stomach him, if only because of those stupid at&t commercials! molly shannon is always entertaining, and leelee sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. some parts were actually painful to watch, reminding me of high school. even though i thankfully didn't get made fun of, it made my heart ache for those who do. movies like this are actually good for children to see--my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was. this movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours. if there's ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you don't have to think very much, then this is definitely a consideration.

drew barrymore gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. in flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster. david arquette is amusing in modest role as drew's brother, who also enrolls to help out sis. lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie. drew keeps making her niche as major innocent-sexy light comic actress.

i thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. i read that drew barrymore wasn't exceptional as josie geller because she is beautiful. yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. the story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, i for sure am. david arquette is mad as her brother rob, and michael vartan is gorgeous as sam coulson. leelee sobieski did an excellent job as her mate aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. i think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a "teeny boppy" flick

this movie may superficially appear to be flaky and for teenie-boppers. it seems to be the stereotypical high school movie. but in fact, it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience. it doesn't propose some unrealistic ending where the geeks and the popular kids reconcile. it doesn't change what happened in adolescence; it just attempts to reckon with it. this is a really great, fun, heart-warming movie, good for teens and for those who can still remember being one...

this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected. of course it's sappy, of course it's predictable. we all know the fairytale. but knowing that when you go to watch it, it's enjoyable enough to watch. it was funny and sweet. i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t-shirts about math. i was an outcast in high school and i didn't do these things. it goes much deeper than that. having to do with many things, some of that being how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids. anyway, i won't get into it. i don't agree with other opinions that drew isn't convincing as a geek. with braces, no make-up and unwashed hair, i don't think too many people would be drooling over her. and even when she goes back to high-school and sheds those things. she's still wearing the "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. and her other "geek" friend may be beautiful but it doesn't matter, where i come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (inside and out)

'never been kissed' is a real feel good film. if you haven't seen it yet, then rent it out. i am going to buy it when its released because i loved it. drew barrymore is excellent again, she plays her part well. i felt i could relate to this film because of the school days i had were just as bad. i thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance which are the type of films i love. i loved the ending because even though you know what's going to happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating!!

there is little more that i would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it. sure, it's surrounded by all the stereotypical hollywood stuff, but i found myself actually engrossed in this movie and very interested in the outcome. i'd recommend it to all you romantics out there in a second!

i love this movie. it focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date from that popular guy billy. and some of us haven't been kissed yet, right? be honest!another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? the fantasy is finding your true love, when you're 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy, but close enough!although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. drew barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job, same as the hilarious david arquette. the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. didn't i just repeat that?never been kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch. it shows reality and some-not issues for people like you and me.

of course, really experienced reviewers who like stuff like star wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it. but really, it is enjoyable teen comedy with an awesome story and good acting.josie gellar (played well by drew barrymore) is part of a news-reporting team and she has been offered a ('real') job - she has to go back to school and find out what teens are like these days. well this goes alright, until josie remembers her horrible time at high school and gets freaked out. but she's never been hip, never been cool, never been popular until now!sit back relax and enjoy with never been kissed!

i saw this movie for a first time years ago, when it was still new and i was satisfied. it's a great hollywood make-belief story for teenagers. however, it's not lifelike. as much as you would want to believe it, these stories never happen. that's why it is irritating to watch movies like that. they play with teenagers' minds, just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed. i wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea isn't worth a 10. there are a lot of films about teenagers. so why don't we make a better one?

i thought this movie was really awesome! one of drew's best. i am also a fan of michael vartan so i thought he was so hot in this movie. why all the bad reviews. i would want to watch this movie over and over again if i could. i also loved the ending. this movie clearly has shown a smile on my face! i was also surprised that james franco and jessica alba were in it. i love them both so i also highlighted this movie. at the end, when drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in high school. again, the movie was amazing. defiantly a 10/10. hope this comment was very useful to any imdb readers.

josie is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again. .as she is there, she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in highschool as we see in flashback scenes.in the flashback they show that (little spoiler) josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom, only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets egged by the ass hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel warmer to josie).i did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school.this movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes. the acting in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for the most part of the movie, there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie.i going to give this movie 7 out 10.

i love this movie so much. it always makes me cry. if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do, you'll love this movie. it's got all the essentials i look for in a movie. it has good actors, good characters, good humor...a lot of heart-warming moments too. the flash-back moments when we see josie in high school make me cry though. every single time. i'm sure you'll like this one, don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even though it is, in a way, a teen movie. sure, if you're a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time, then this isn't for you. but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: drew barrymore is great in this one!

never been kissed starring drew barymore as reporter josie gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named josie gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. only problem is josie has never been popular. high school was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally "fit in" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. it is however, very sweetly done. drew barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. i also enjoyed leelee sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends josie on her first day at the school.never been kissed has some really funny moments as josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. example-the reggae bar scene.i also loved the appearance of josie's brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give josie her "dream" of finally fitting in is just hilarious. at the same time, as josie's woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to josie to be affected by her story-drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore josie from the beginning.there is a lot of "mean girls" a 2004 release, in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.i liked this movie. it was really beautifully done in some areas. the movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way? oh yeah yeah yeah baby! but it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. the movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to josie-i've met people very much like all these characters-i think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. not unrealistic at all. what struck me was drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the "sheep mentality" that can exist so prevalently -as hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. i'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. it's engaging, sweetly acted and just rufus. i'd say check it out. 8 of 10.

never been kissed gives drew barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age i doubt i could pull it off the way drew does.of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it's like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the great big unfriendly world out there. i've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. in fact there is a law and order episode which explores the dark side of this same situation. a girl looking young enough to pull it off, goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret.with drew though it's an assignment. she's a copy editor for the chicago sun times who yearns to be a reporter. publisher garry marshall who plays the part like donald trump took over the sun times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the masquerade. high school the first time was bad enough. drew was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around. that is until brother david arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches.of course this raises a whole lot of issues for drew, peer pressure from two sources, job and school. what's a girl to do?never been kissed is a light and charming comedy which to its credit skips over the opportunity to be crassly exploitive and gives us some good entertainment. drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos. michael vartan as her english teacher is the kind i wish there were more of in the education field and leelee sobieski and jessica alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that drew tries so desperately to hook up with.still it doesn't inspire me to return to midwood high school.

i saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. i have the dvd. it's one of drew barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. not being popular in high school was one f the things in the film i could relate to. i wasn't quite as tortured as josie was (during her real high school days) or like aldys, but i was never the go- to-the-major-party type either. the prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as josie pushes way aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and i clapped when i first saw it. i can still watch this movie today. it is excellent.

i can't say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy, as i found little funny about it. i did find it endearing, entertaining, heartwarming, and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, i found them more bittersweet than outright comedic.i liked this one. barrymore has grown so much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen, but this translates well to the small screen, too. in fact, on subsequent viewings, i like this one more and more.if you're a fan of the romantic comedy, then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one, but if you're in it for the romance, it's definitely here to be found.it rates a 7.8/10 from...the fiend :.

very sadly, i can relate to this movie, as i'm 17, and have yet to be kissed, so i really feel for josie. it's been a while since seeing this film, but to write this review i re-watched it, and remembered everything i loved about it.drew barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her really well at the time. the chemistry between sam and josie was really good, and michael vartan was an excellent actor in this.i loved the storyline too - as i said up there, i could relate, and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to.all over - i loved it. 7/10

this is a truly hilarious film and one that i have seen many times. drew barrymore is brilliant as josie geller, as is david arquette as her brother. you cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like! her outfits are wacky and weird, and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently! the gorgeous michael vartan was adorable as the teacher (wish there had been teachers like that when i was at high school!) and josie's boss is fantastic. this is a film you could watch again and again, with a fabulous sound track! one for all those at school in the 90's to watch!

i think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress drew barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something i never imagined her being. a great flick with lots of laughs . i don't usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one.

i loved this movie. not as great as "50 first dates", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a feel good movie. drew as josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. with all the junk out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. this is definitely one of her best roles!

i'm not sure if these other people saw the movie - some apparently couldn't follow the "complicated plot". he's a billionaire who owns an oil company who also happens to big game hunt - wow - that's really far fetched. any way - his new "drilling machine" happens to break through a glacier and on the other side is a world seperated from our own time where dinosaurs and cavemen wander around. nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous. anyway the rest of the movie is about this t-rex they find (which the billionaire, boone, claimed was there) hunting them and them hunting it. look - it's an old made for tv movie - of course the special effects look cheesy - they didn't have cg - they did the best they could and for a mftvm they did a hell of a job for the time. this movie should be remade for the big screen - i'd love it and i'd be the first one in line. seeing that dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great!

this movie is kind of good. it seem that they used the tyrannosaurus rex like a blown up balloon, just like godzilla, just maybe back in those 60-70's days, scientist haven't got enough info. on all sorts of dinosaurs. back in those time scientist still making dinosaur, so i guess this movie was base on a tyrannosaurus rex movements back in the 60-70's. there even a part where a giant rock, fired by someone at the tyrannosaurus rex, it damage the tyrannosaurus rex and it was knock out for a little while. at the end, the tyrannosaurus rex went back to search for food. there is something wrong in the movie as well, like a rifle, how can one rifle kill a tyrannosaurus rex, when it could be 1,000-5,000 stronger than we are. if this film going to make a remake, i suggest make it more good and excited, because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it, if lucky.

great cult flick for mst-3k types: richard boone is a mess -- bad hair, arthritis, even his dark glasses aren't right; about as good as a bad dino-flick can get... actually, that charging saber-toothed styracosaurus was pretty cool -- maybe spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one.

surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a de-sanctified church to restore a life size and life like crucified man . the piece was christ and the two thieves, however christ was long ago sold off. trouble starts once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman. from that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul. creepy, scary and much better than you think the film works because its cast sells the events which are decidedly adult. it helps that these are real people who are flawed so its easier to relate to them. i really liked this film, and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade i was shocked at how good it is. definitely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem.

"l'ossessa" (released in english under many titles and the eeriest of them certainly is "the eerie midnight horror show") is one of the best italian rip-offs of "the exorcist". to really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor. "l'ossessa" is at the same time sleazy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving.danila (stella carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she's going to restore. it's a wooden statue of christ, a demonic christ, maybe already overcome by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning dark deeds. the face shows infinite torment. the statue dates from the 15th century. danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor - the statue seems almost alive! she lives with her parents. her mother luisa (lucretia love) lives a dissolute life and doesn't care too much for keeping up appearances. her father mario (chris avram) observes everything with disenchanted eyes.the wooden statue will soon assume a human form (ivan rassimov) and possess danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. an amazing scene! the poor danila, from now on, will suffer the torments of hell.danila (the lovely stella carnacina) was ravished, violated, possessed by the devil and now following his orders, she will try to seduce others. ain't she emulating her sleazy mother luisa (lucretia love) who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bunch of roses? there is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving, when stella carnacina runs in despair through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) of a small italian town screaming her heart out. luigi pistilli is a very good exorcist. his performance is, as usual, intense. the exorcism scenes (particularlly the final battle) are very, very amateurish, but this will only enhance the fun (and/or emotion?) if you've really got a sense of humor.stella carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and that's a factor that adds to your pleasure when she's naked, but i think that the film could have explored more her natural beauty. lucretia love is a very good sleaze companion (her nude scene with the roses... well.:) other italian exorcist rip-offs i would like to recommend for you are: malabimba (very sleazy and released uncut and digitally restored) "evil eye" (malocchio) - "the exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "evil eye", but others films, like, for instance, "rosemary's baby" should also be taken into account. "evil eye" is completely over the top. not that sleazy but with plenty of gorgeous italian and spanish actresses. you'll be drooling all over the film. the film is ridiculous, the story doesn't make any sense, but if you see it in the right mood you might feel moved! - a diabolical sect, possession, murders, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women all around. a wild ride! if you liked "evil eye", see also "ring of darkness" (un'ombra nell'ombra). this film can be found in the alternative market. search this title in the imdb. there are good reviews about it.p.s. - "l'ossessa" has many different faces. it's exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. it's cheap, cheesy... sleazy (but not that much) and it has an underlying "moral" message. this strange brew can sometimes be very funny. we all already know that "l'ossessa" is an "exorcist" rip-off so why can't we see it on its own terms? yes, mario gariazzo was trying to earn a fast buck, but he was able get the most out of a shoestring budget. the story is well told, the film is atmospheric and overall the actors are committed to their roles. see the film with an open mind and you may discover two or three new things.

italian soft x exorcist clone.woman buy statue of crucified thief. said thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies.ivan rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. mostly due to his gift of evil looks. and because he was never above doing nudity. good on him.the actress in the lead did a decent job. her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped.this one has a similar plot element to most italian horror films. the girl's parents are filthy rich, and depraved. watch it to get the details.laura gemser's husband, gabriel tinti, also appears as a random stud. his part is basically phoned-in, but like a cheap beer, it did the job.fault the director for its failings. this could have been a horror/sex classic.

l'ossessa, also known as the tormented or the sexorcist, or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show, is a forgotten exorcist rip-off which contains one of the best horror moments i've ever seen. the scene is when the crucifix comes alive. this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great fxs). it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene.this is one of the most frustrating movies ever. imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip-off. had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. she, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is stupid!!!if you like so-called "euro-cult" movies, the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other euro-cult movies. but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatas, the remaining 45 minutes suck. boring. it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate (badly) the exorcist. so, watch the first 45 minutes of l'ossessa and enjoy the 1970s fashions, the sleaze and the amazing statue-comes-alive-to-ravish-the-girl scene but after the first 45 minutes, press stop and eject, and might as well go clip your toenails.

it's true that this is not realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre that i look to for realism. what counts is that the characters are likeable and, as needed, sexy. shalom is beautiful and relaxed and jake weber is handsome in an offhand kind of way. they have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts, sexual attraction. i would love to see either of them in another movie. and yes, the clown is pretty cute too.

"cherry" tells of a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby but isn't quite sure how to go about it. this easy going little sleeper is full of quirky characters and tongue-in-cheek situational humor. fresh, fun, mold breaking stuff, i happened to really enjoy this flick...for whatever that's worth. recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.

i watched this movie thinking it was going to be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the corniness, bad special effects, etc. but, i was pleasantly surprised. not to say that it's the best vampire movie i have ever seen, but it certainly isn't the worst. i liked the whole alternate reality/dream state that played into the movie. the graphics were quite well for a straight to dvd movie and i liked the overall look of the film. i enjoyed the main character sai. i usually end up hating the female leads but there was something about her that kept me interested. yes, she does make some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but i was expecting that too. i don't know if i'd highly recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised. i'm putting this one on my guilty pleasures list.

i gave this movies a 7 out of 10. i think the general dislike of this movie is due to people not really understanding the plot. if you think about the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense, it just doesn't ever give you a dumbed-down explanation. its true that the special effects are sub-par and it appears semi low budget, but i think the originality of the plot keeps you drawn in. people say that the vampire genre is overdone and clichéd out, but with bled, what you get is not your conventional vampire flick. its a dream/alternate reality story- line with a vampire/eternal life spin on it. i loved it. the only thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that i personally dislike movies where most of the people have accents. but like i said earlier, if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie..

i don't see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews?!?! i loved this movie! bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, i can see why you would not like this film. it was a great twist from the average, played out vampire movie. if you are looking for a fresh, new and ingenious new vampire movie, then this is for you. but if you want one of those turn into bats, wolves and melt in the sunlight movies, then go watch your old played out dracula flicks. sure, it is a bit on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. i'm very happy that i found this movie, because i was about to give up on the vampire genre fro good. i thought this film was brilliant! i give 2 thumbs up to the writer, director and everyone involved in the film.

i caught this movie on the horror channel and was quite impressed by the film's gothic atmosphere and tone. as a big fan of all things vampire related, i am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos, in this case, a ghoul-like creature residing in a lovecraftian other dimension. the director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject, using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space- the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story. the characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind-altering substance, where a shape-shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires, whilst draining them of their life essence. there are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. i enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story, chris ivan cevic and alex petrovich, who were very attractive hunks, always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers! the special effects make up and creature effects were well done, and the set design of the vampire's dimension was very effective. all in all, an enjoyable take on vampire myths, and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. the only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity, as it would have suited the plot and themes.

like a twisty country road, "tough luck" takes the viewer for a ride. there is nothing wrong with plot curves, as long as believability doesn't fly out the window. unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience's belief tolerance. nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting, character development, and wonderful carnival atmosphere. do not expect to like any of the characters. armand asante, norman redus, and dagmara dominczyk, play shady con-artists, not exactly the type of person easily admired. the double crosses come fast and furious, and the final cross is a bit of a stretch. recommended. - merk

tough luck follows a homeless drifter as he becomes entangled in the underground crime world of deception and chaos. archie(norman reedus) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose. he is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named ike(armand assante) hires him for work. soon ike discloses a strong desire for archie to murder his mischievous wife, divana(dagmara dominczyk), an erotic dancer for the carnival. things soon get complicated when archie falls in love with divana and warns her of the scheme. they become involved in a very steamy affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer, after which they soon make a plan. together they plot to murder ike, but things don't go quite as planned.i would be lying if i said that this film didn't surprise me. i was, personally, blown away by how good this film was. upon renting it several years back, i was expecting another cliché thriller with a lot of the typical elements and themes that are shown in a lot of films of that type these days. within minutes i was hooked and found myself quite involved with the world of this film. it's the kind of film, much like buffalo '66, that just sucks you in and transports you into the style and the feeling of paranoia. it is a film that really pulls it off in stunning fashion. one thing i particularly appreciated was how the film depicted it's characters. the film isn't as easy and clear cut as it may appear in the plot summary. these are characters that you actually grow to care about and are fascinated by, including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys. in truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this film. all of the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true-to-life. there aren't many films that manage to accomplish this task as flawlessly as this film does, but it's definitely a film style that i like and i want to see more of from films today. there were quite a few crime films that were like that back in the early 50s, but there hasn't been one as gripping and unique as this ever since! in terms of flaws, i have mostly very minor gripes. the film itself isn't exactly original. however, i doubt that most folks would expect it to be original. the film's editing style also may be irritating to some folks as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky cam throughout. while i wasn't bothered by it and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere, i'm sure most viewers will not be as enthralled by it and may find it generally off-putting. despite the minor flaws, however, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. it's so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good. it seems as if this film was a direct-to-video release, though this film is far better than that. had it been put in theaters, it wouldn't have won any awards nor would it have been seen much, but it would have a lot more recognition than it has today. recognition that this film deserves. tough luck is an astounding, entertaining, and twisted neo-noir thriller with a real sense of class and style juxtapose and with enough substance to make the average moviegoer more than simply satisfied.

i watched this movie on hbo and i had a good time.the director has done a great work. i found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started. norman reedus's performance is cool. i expect more chilling movies from him.i was so absorbed that on occasions i wanted to grab gun from norman and shoot that snake girl. hehe. i like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly. the ending was what i wanted :)) this movie is filled with twists of moments. you expect this but something else happens. in the beginning, those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes.although it was not shown when norman reedus changed currency notes? or is it me standing by fridge. :)

this is a quirky heist/caper film, one that seems predictable at first then keeps surprising until the last scene. the protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a little carnival, where he's paid to kill the manager's belly dancer wife divana then ends up falling for her himself. she's alluring, tricky and deadly and she keeps disappearing and popping up again like some sort of magician's trick. the film's other props include her duplicitous husband/employer (played by the talented armand assante), some nasty dominican mobsters and most important to the plot, a suitcase full of money. just like the old "shell game," the one where you have to guess which one the pea's under, you'll be guessing who's got the money, and like the victims of the hucksters who run such games, you'll probably guess wrong. dagma dominczyk, as lovely divana, is a talented performer and an eyeful, whether she's dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working her grift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. norman reedus is fine as the young con who is flummoxed by the elusive beauty he was paid to kill. don't count him out, however, for he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for. this oddball film is worth a look.

i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.the early part is difficult to follow, but later it clears up. i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.some of the acting is unconvincing, but maybe that's because i was always expecting some kind of double-cross. in that case, the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other, so it fits very well.the important theme is the carnival owner (assante) is laundering money for a local casino & his snake-charmer wife (dagmara dominczyk) wants to steal it. she complains to "archie" (reedus) how terrible her life is, and how he could help her get out of it.there are 3 or 4 plot twists (which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends), and just when you think you have solved the mystery, something else will happen.my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time.

this one surprised me.i read a few reviews beforehand that called it a good b-grade movie and was prepared for the worst. halfway through it i suddenly realised i was completely wrapped up in it and enjoying it a lot. there were some really tense moments that had you sitting forward fiddling nervously with the remote control or any other object in reach. overall this movie definitely doesn't deserve the b-grade tag.credit must be given to director, gary ellis and writers, bill boatman & todd king for their movie debut. i hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio backing.

didn't really know what to expect from this movie-and found myself being pleasantly surprised. i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in.i'm not big into hustler movies or con movies, but i have to say, this one roped me in within minutes. probably because i couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who. this movie is stylish and fast-paced, with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances.while i was impressed with most in the film, i must say dagmara dominczyk was simply excellent.give it a chance-it's a really fun film.

not having heard of this film, it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently. gary ellis, the gifted director of "tough luck", does wonders with the screen play written by bill boatman and todd king. the film involves the viewer from the start.archie, the young hustler at the center of this story, has been involved in all kinds of petty crime. in fact, we witness a confrontation right at the beginning which makes him get out of new orleans, as fast as he can. he ends up in the carnival that is run by the mysterious ike. archie falls for davina, the woman he should have been wise to stay away from. the result proves a fatal judgment for archie who then becomes the object of double crossing all around.the director should be commended by the casting of norman reedus, who obviously is loved by the camera. in spite of his nature, one feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place. the beautiful dagmara dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer divana who, in spite of being ike's lover, entices archie into falling heads over heels with her. armand assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film."tough luck" shows a new director, gary ellis, showing he will go to do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing.

i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully. i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film, and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten, late '20s style but 1932 movie, which should probably be referred to as "indecent," as that is the name on the main titles.myrna loy, best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles, shows herself to be miscast in all of them. she was a true dramatic actress, something that i did not know before watching this film, which predates all of her famous roles. she is exciting and moving here, two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell. i'm still rather in shock over how good she was.becky sharp (1935), the first three-strip technicolor feature, is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation. it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. you cannot take my word for it, you must see it.

i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based. and while this modern version of becky sharp's story is a b film, the casting of loy, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.before loy became mgm's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. vanity fair was loy's follow-up film to emma, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (marie dressler).loy's becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins' version 3 years later in becky sharp. loy's becky is very much a pre-code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. it's the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played, but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. that's what makes her fallen character so tragic.in counterpoint to loy's grasping becky is the goody goody amelia (barbara kent) who is just not an interesting character. mary forbes is icily good as mrs. sedley. most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: conway tearle as rawdon; walter byron as osborne; anthony bushell as dobbin. others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness: billy bevan as joseph; lionel belmore as crawley; montagu love as the marquis; lilyan irene as polly the maid; elspeth dudgeon as the housekeeper.loy is front and center throughout. while the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. the more loy's becky descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught." bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen.

i've never read a good review for "vanity fair" and i can't understand why. for something that was "rushed through in ten days" it all comes off surprisingly well. though admittedly "becky sharp" is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky, there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9/10. at times, myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch, but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. meow! the move to a more modern setting did not work against "vanity fair" and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting. barbara kent (amelia) was under 5 feet in height, and few of the leading men were very tall either - this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman!"vanity fair" is similar to "craig's wife" in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. and you know she deserves her comeuppance, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. though based on the same story as "becky sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. for pleasure value, the ending of "becky sharp" is ultimately more enjoyable, although aesthetically, and from the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the ending of "vanity fair" is the better one, whether or not you actually like it.

this show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. if you had never truly seen a european variety show in the 70's or 80's (or at least a mexican one) the entire show would probably be lost on you. if you had, this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst. helmed by a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan of an ex-wife, "viva variety" is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in-fighting and acts gone very wrong. the hosts are joined by "johnny bluejeans", a dim witted side-kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him, which of course, they don't.the result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general. imagine the arguing that probably happened backstage during the last days of the "sonny & cher show". now imagine it's happening onstage in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure. now add cheesy acts and a euro-riche mentality (tuxedoes, gowns, booze, accents and smokes). now you have "viva variety".have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians? too conceptual? viva variety did this for comedians. way too esoteric for the standard american audience. it was funny as hell. and doomed.

viva variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented. it was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite, "the sonny & cher show," with thomas lennon and kerri kenney playing a divorced show biz couple who were somehow forced to host this program together, the female of the pair towering over the male, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" the couple tossed at each other, plus sketch comedy bits and performances from what are most kindly described as "specialty" acts! the "hybrid" was the mix of fact and fantasy. of course, there was no "mr. and former mrs. laupin," and the program's announcer, johnny bluejeans, was likewise equally fictional. but all the acts that performed were certainly real, and some were even entertaining! but there were also some acts that would have clearly been better suited for the old chuck barris "gong show." the show itself was really more like an extended sketch from "sctv" (it was borne from the mtv series, "the state," after all), and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like that one, rather than a stand alone series. but "viva variety" certainly should get high marks for original concepts, and even though it was often more odd than funny, it was certainly worthwhile, especially when they road tripped to las vegas and brought in even glitzier acts to perform. it's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again.

otto preminger's "porgy and bess" stands, to date, as a great american musical. i believe it is time bring this film out onto vhs and dvd for countless generations to view, admire, and absorb its wonderful music.

i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. this had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition. the film should be seen if only for sammy davis jrs brilliant catlike performance as sportin' life, creeping in and out of shadows. his seduction of dorothy dadridge's bess "there's a boat dat's leavin' soon for new york," is one of many highlights. nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. it certainly never bores which the recent pbs and met versions did. it was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven't had a chance to experience it.

i see it when i was 12 year old and i dream to see it again !what marvelous sammy davis jr singing "it ain't necessarily so !"

i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era. the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it.i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie,but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past.my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since.the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. porky and bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models. the singing and acting had me skipping for days, playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie.

snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week. reading the other comments here i see the results. a lot of people are mad. mad because it doesn't have the best special effects. mad because it doesn't have a star cast. mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say "i'm sick of these m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing snakes on this m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing train"! well, this sure ain't the samuel jackson version. and maybe that's good.snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror, a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death. saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears, and as far as kids go, they would be traumatized by the violence.snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was. this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train. sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects. but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the "on a plane" version was tripping all over itself from the first scene on.i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the "...on a train" version was a little dry. but hey, in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did.for this it gets a 7 out of 10.

this is one of the funniest movies ever made. and for those of you who don't get it, it's supposed to be funny. so often comedies try to be so intentionally funny that it misses, but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being hilarious in the most subtle of ways. even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. it is a comedic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios are fdoing this sort of thing regularly. kudos to the makers, and to a hilariously subtle cast of actors, including isaac wade, whose performances is top-notch. truly, a real break-out star performance by an true underrated stage actor. it'll be great to see this guy get his due.

ladies and gentlemen, we've really got ourselves a winner here. actually we don't, but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker. poor alma (fetching julia ruiz) is suffering from an ancient mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside of her body. alma and her deranged shaman husband brujo (alby castro, who feverishly overacts with delicious eye-rolling intensity) stowaway on a train that's bound for los angeles. naturally, a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. the mallachi brothers, working from an absurd script by eric fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise straight, thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese. the cruddy cgi effects, the pathetically unfrightening common variety gardner snakes (there's would-be scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace), the plodding pace, the total dearth of any tension or momentum, the obvious rickety stage-bound train set, and especially the simply astonishing "you gotta be kiddin' me!" over-the-top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw-dropping awfulness. better still, we also got game (if lame) acting from a no-name cast, a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score, and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make-up f/x. bonus points for the fact that the token irritatingly cutesy little girl gets eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer who gets caught smoking crack out of a hollow light bulb (!?). an absolute gut-buster of a kitsch howler.

ok firstly, if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with this. you really need to be a fan to get the gag.the move is basically about snakes ..on a train. lots of them.there is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending which i wont spoil. the gore effect are full on and real icky... but the movie is mainly one big gory gag about snakes scaring the hell out of a bunch of people trapped on a train.the suspense is built up well and there are some memorable and well composed scenes.. some of the acting is a bit hammy (watch for the surf dudes) but thats not really the point... give this movie a go. know what to expect and you wont regret it!

the tagline on the box hails, "100 trapped passengers... 3,000 venomous vipers!" you almost have to admire that degree of "no chance in hell we're ever going to deliver on this promise" bullshit. i could admire the asylum's hucksterism more so if they made movies that, well, you know, were good or, at the very least, worth a damn. haha, and it's what i like about theses movies. they are garbage. you put them in a toilet and then you flush. it worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies. it may become a cult classic among many fans. the gore scenes are effectives, there's not much i can say, it's a z flick that parody the new movie with samuel l. jackson, hell, it may be better so who knows!

forget everything that you have ever read about the mallachi brothers' straight-to-video release "snakes on a train," especially if it was a negative review. this movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off: "snakes on a plane." frankly, i am surprised that more people aren't rhapsodizing about this low-budget asylum release. instead, most reviews that i've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy, such as the acting was amateurish, the action didn't numerically live up to the advertising, and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time. of course, it doesn't help that the title is a tip-off to the obvious rip-off nature of this film. actually, i felt that "snakes on a train" surpassed "snakes on a plane" for a number of reasons.first, the producers used real, genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed an entire amtrak like train. how many movies have a snake gobble a train? as a result, "snakes on a train" ranks as the first movie to scale that height.second, this low-budget movie employs some grisly gross-out effects. the woman who coughs up baby snakes--real ones--was fantastic! the special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing! also, you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake. she was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or thereabouts, and she died screaming all the way as nasty olé giant mister snake head swallows her. not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten! this is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won't find in 99 % of all theatrical hollywood releases. of course, she wasn't eaten by a real snake, but it's the subversive thought that counts.third, it is one of those cursed upon movies where alma (julia ruiz of "that guy"), the chief female character--no heroine--has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man that they recommended. as a result, she is filled with snakes, coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake. imagine medusa, the mythical characters that had snakes for hair, only with the snakes in her belly. her psycho-shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to l.a. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal. talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines. prepare yourself for lots of slime, blood, and gore. fourth, the train had only about twenty or so passengers, not hundreds. nevertheless, it looked like the mallachi brothers filmed this above-average horror flick on-board a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks.fifth, the snakes slither around for the first hour, quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody. in other words, it's suspense, suspense, suspense, before people start dying from snake bites.up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it, "snakes on a train" is warped, wonderful, and way-out. it doesn't have the attention deficit editing of a big league hollywood movie. it's a fantasy about an unfortunate hispanic women victimized because of her feminist, at-odds-with-society attitude. altogether, you've got gory fantasy type stuff; suspenseful snakes slithering around the train, and am over-the-top gigantic snake at the end. incidentally, they get on board the train because a bunch of other mexicans have bribed a train employee and the mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free.i think it's better than "snakes on a plane" if you want a tough, little, independently produced horror movie.

let's get one thing straight, this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun'd by everyone else. i went in with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it delivers! the gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs, even a electrical engineer getting his pimp on! you get to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face!! as i mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off, but respectable nonetheless. movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this. there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock-down or boa vs python, but those are some big shoes to fill. a solid 7 out of 10.

forget some the whiny (and pointless) comments left here by some. this series is well acted, well shot, and makes a refreshing change to most of the pap on tv.any fool can nitpick anything. however, in this show the characters are believable, the story lines intriguing and compelling (but do require some intelligence on the part of the viewer), overall it's enjoyable, and it's british !! (we do occasionally come up with some gems, and this is one of them).the shows are an hour long each and i think there are four of them all together (at least i've only seen four of them). the show clearly impressed some u.s. tv station/director who made a longer series which was nowhere near as compelling in spite of the bigger budget.if like soaps and reality shows you won't like or understand eleventh hour.

probably this is the best film of clint eastwood. here action is minimal, but with plenty of good acting. a yankee soldier eastwood is wounded and taken by the female pupils and teachers of a school in the south, where he is hidden and taken care. shortly after his recovery all ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them succeeded including the director of the school(geraldine page). erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their "macho" was shared by several of them, so they became angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner. geraldine page, although somewhat old, was able to play a very suggestive role as the director of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.

this is a classic movie that dramatizes the plight of a man who cannot adjust to changes taking place in society and feels more and more alienated, which leads to violence. joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he is needs is a pretext to lash out, which is what the story is about. alone, joe is quiet; together with someone else, he becomes lethal. and what makes the character of joe even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that to him it's not only not bad, it's necessary. for joe projects his own violent tendencies onto those who he considers "the enemy" and therefore considers himself to be in a war, and in this movie, the "generation gap" is portrayed as a war. but it is a war in joe's mind only, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. nobody wants to fight joe, but joe feels he must defend himself. although this movie was released in 1970, it's message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to undergo major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively dramatizes.

though i saw this movie about 4 years ago long before i started commenting on imdb, i decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now i often reviewed something just after seeing it. what can i say? well, the best performance is that of the late peter boyle as the title character who, after finding out about a man's killing the drug-dealing boyfriend of his daughter, wants to bond with him even though he's a madison avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower-class conservative joe. in fact, there are plenty of funny scenes of joe at this guy's party making smart alecky remarks there. oh, and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than susan sarandon making her film debut! this was a pretty hard-hitting movie for the time it was made (late '60s-early '70s) and was compelling work from scripter norman wexler (later of saturday night fever) and director john g. avildsen (later to do save the tiger, rocky, and the karate kid). certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. p.s. among the cultural artifacts seen here are a raggedy ann doll, a box of ritz crackers, a bottle of heinz ketchup, and, unique for the era, a nixon poster asking, "would you buy a used car from this man?"

new yorkers contemporaneous with this film will recall how reflective of its time it is and how well cast and crew captured america, new york city of that era.norman wexler's script delineates the different worlds the various sub groupings live in and avildsen's direction brings out phenomenal performances all around. peter boyle's prodigious talent is on display as never before nor since. clearly it is the best character portrayal the always likable dennis patrick ever accomplished.what i will always remember about joe is the feeling of having been in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater. knowing that what the screen portrayed was seething under the surface in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of the city of new york.this film needs to be remembered.

i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during it's original theatrical release - the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love, along with the pre-watergate tension of fear and paranoia. it's hard to believe that it's thirty seven years later, and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend. like marveling at peter boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck, sure to typecast him the rest of his career (oh, how wrong!), and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country. to this day, my buddy and i still use joe curran's line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma; curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades.it's curious to read comments about the film from others on this board, particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were. still, if you were around during that time, the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then, pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal. if you really want dated, when was the last time you heard the words macy's and gimbel's in the same sentence, or a line like joe's - "come on, get with the pepsi generation". for historical perspective, you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes - "would you buy a used car from this man?" with minor intricacies like those, director john avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago.today's viewing was only the second time i've seen the movie, and i have to admit i don't remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles, but then again, this was her very first picture. the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time, shocking in fact, as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention. "joe" took a major leap in that regard, particularly since it was a 'mainstream' picture.with the passage of time, the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work. i mean, how do you go from "joe" to that hilarious rendition of 'puttin' on the ritz' in "young frankenstein"? and my absolute favorite episode of 'x-files' has boyle as clyde bruckman, in both a tender and tragic, funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once. and as a career capper, frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television. even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he-- whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations. he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already.

unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail. peter boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed boorish portrayal of a working class stiff "joe" in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present. the first half hour of the show features the film debut of a young susan sarrandon as melissa compton, a weak willed rich girl who slums with her loser boyfriend, replete with a full nude scene. her boyfriend is the film's weak spot, a poorly portrayed drug addict and dealer who meets his demise following sarrandon's overdose. we meet boyle's joe in a bar as he spouts off and rants about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it is easy to see that the later norman lear television character of archie bunker is based on a cleaned up version of joe. the comparison even carries over into joe's wife and personal life and pastimes. joe insinuates himself into the life of bill compton, melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts she calls friends. their search leads them to an "oar-gee" as joe calls it, a free love fest fueled by drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly, uptight bill compton and ultra conservative joe both join in. they get robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that foreshadows the stark and chilling ending to taxi driver six years later. joe is a funny film that on the surface at least, is anti violence and anti racist. yet the film's main character, joe, becomes the very instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters and joins in the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he rants against. so in that respect, the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was all about.

after recently seeing, cry uncle, by the same director, i decided to seek this out and am i glad i did!? this is an extraordinarily good film. far, far better than it would seem likely given the ingredients. how many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class dad mixing it with the flower children aagh! and yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable. not ideal, not good or bad but believable. peter boyle, as the working class, hippie and ni**er hater and dennis patrick as the uptight suit, play their respective parts immaculately and i can't remember ever seeing the two classes getting together like this without things getting sentimental. susan sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have all that much to do in her first film. this is a truly, must see film capturing as it does that very short period in western and in particular us times when the counter culture was about to bust itself wide open.

warning: reading this entry after watching the movie! like 'easy rider' released a year before, 'joe' tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream (albeit right-wing) america meet: a violent end ensues. although this film is for the most part a slow-moving display of traditional "old-fashion" american morals versus the 60's "do-what-feels-good" lifestyle, it is also a commentary on upper-class vs. lower-middle class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the comptons meet the currans. boyle's joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s where 'kill a commie for mommy (or jap or hippie for that matter) is okay so long as it helps and saves america. joe and wife mary jo are clearly the archetypes for archie bunker and dingbat wife, edith. this movie - which will forever be known for it's violent (but not bloody - no blood is seen at all) ending is uneven however. joe blasts (verbally) the hippie generation then (literally) lays down with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate compton's daughter - when clearly he should have been repulsed by the idea but forgoes the separatist idea for the sake of sex. when he is betrayed through thievery (read: trust of the older generation to the newer generation), he lashes out through an unrelenting chain of murder. perhaps it is due to the tarantinos of hollywood that the watcher expects blood-streaming death in the end scene, but the bloodless shootings long for any sort of impact or realism. 'joe' is not a great movie, but it is an interesting display of class and culture alienation and the animalistic underlying extremes to the generation gap.

i only voted excellent because this film took two snapshots of americana: one in 1970, and one for every year afterward. nothing's really changed.joe is actually a jerk, a big stupid slob who's mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy. this ain't really a spoiler, but the key to the film is the big, corporate "never does wrong" guy making friends with this semi-troglodyte joe, and he gets some kind of...validation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged. yet, few would argue, that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die. and those kids shouldn't have ripped joe and compton off. and joe and compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off. a simple film in many ways, except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to nixon's care, and all of the money going to the war in vietnam. as i write this (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on netflix for this film - which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn. this was a pretty good snapshot - not exact, a bit caricaturist - but actually pretty close to how it was back then. and the scary thing is - things haven't changed that much. sure, there's no more welfare, but that just means the wage-slavery has won out. amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money, then complain that $5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.

i finally have seen the real reason why peter boyle became famous. it wasn't being the monster in "young frankenstein" or being cranky frank barone on "everybody loves raymond". for younger people who only know him from tv,give this film a try,it makes frank look like a saint."joe" is boyle in his finest acting role and as someone mentioned,most likely gave the inspiration for "archie bunker" on "all in the family". i think boyle even went back to "joe" a little to play frank. (i say this because i noticed the basement of both "joe" & frank barone look similar.)i knew nothing of this movie when i checked it out of the library,i just knew boyle and susan sarandon were featured. yes,susan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role. a young hippie wanna be,who escapes her parents home and lives with,the ultimate lost in a drug induced haze hippie,who also sells as much as he buys.after a near-fatal over-dose on too many pills,she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her things,her mother wont go into the smelly,run down apartment but her father does. while dad gathers up her things,her boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we will later hear joe say he'd like to do to a hippie.joe is shooting his mouth off about how he hates different cultures/races,hippies and a laundry list of others. when he says,"i'd really like to kill one of them",the father (trying to look like he's kidding)says,"i just did". joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny. later,when the police are at the scene and the story is in the paper,joe realizes,he wasn't kidding. instead of nailing the rich guy for money through blackmail,he actually,kind of,does blackmail him. by just wanting him and his wife to "get to know" him and his wife. long story short their association is awkward but after sarandon gets wind of what her father has done,the bottom is at risk of falling out.how this all plays out in the end you'll have to watch for yourself. although it's over 35 years ago,the ending is something you wont expect. unless you've seen the film before of course. again,i recommend it mostly for those who haven't seen it.10 stars for boyle not just playing someone completely opposite his nature but for what will show others that he was more than just a tv and movie comedy actor. (end)

22. joe (drama, 1970) joe (peter boyle) is a racist factory worker who's known to hate "hippies and ni**ers". he meets bill, a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addict young daughter jill (susan sarandon). jill runs away and joins a hippie commune at the outskirts of town. bill turns to joe for help. their search leads them through the seediest parts of town where both men's inner hatred and loath is furthered tested.critique: this was director john g. avildsen's first sleeper-turned smash hit (an amazing run which included: 'rocky', 'the karate kid', 'split-image', 'weekend at bernie's'). film is interesting enough in that it served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (vietnam war, black power, women's lib etc.). it also has a good performance from peter boyle as joe, one of the cinema's first antiheroes. he's always been good at playing creepy, bossy heavies whose abstract ideas are enforced by his intimidating presence (he would play the frankenstein monster in mel brook's spoof young frankenstein). he reminds me of a little kid trapped in a big, dumb, awkward body. film has a weak script (the meeting of joe and bill, for instance, is a bit coincidental), but it has a particularly gruesome, post-taxi driver ending.quote: title song: "i saw a fella selling junk to children. he gets nervous every time i pass cause he knows that if i catch him i'm gonna kick his head and kick his fat a$$."

if archie bunker was armed, he may well have been "joe". however, "all in the family" would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie. joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. one night he meets a man in a bar, bill, who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe. what happens is that bill's daughter was living with the junkie, and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose, and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend, who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. in the struggle that ensues, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know, of course. but he lets it slip to joe, and then when the newspapers and tv reports come out, joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. he hooks up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. which is, in a way, almost worse. now, bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in, and slips back home, and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe & bill infiltrating "the underground" to try to find her. this builds up to a rather shocking ending, which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note, or wrong note, depending on your point of view. a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's, mostly from a working class bigot's point of view, which makes it not for everyone, but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.

it is important to realise that eisenstein was a committed marxist film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve, and how.it is simply idle to compare alexander nevsky negatively with anything from a similar period in the us; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from an entirely different approach to cinema.to appreciate this film a little more, try finding out about pudovkin's and kuleshov's theories of montage, for example, or read the wikipedia entry on marxist film theory. if you're feeling really bold, you might even investigate the triadic forms of hegelian dialectic.it follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won't get it. in alexander nevsky the main characters aren't playing themselves, they are meant to be distillations of their nation's character. nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown larger-than-life, because they represent stylised, heroic aspects of the entire russian people.the acting isn't wooden, it's meant to be slightly mannered. it represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic, narrative style which hollywood was rapidly adopting. eisenstein's films are especially designed *not* to be realistic. if anything seems somewhat "obvious", whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor, it's meant to be that way. eisenstein was one of the early proponents of film as an art form, not just as entertainment.if the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images, well, that's the idea. shots are meant to contrast with each other, eisenstein's films contain and embody elements of a political/philosophical argument, namely marxist dialectic.so sit back, shout hurrah for russia and her folk-hero defenders, boo at the cowardly nobles and the teuton invaders, and enjoy the difference.

i believe anyone who enjoyed eisentein's ivan the terrible movies would enjoy this well crafted movie. this movie played out like "lord of the ring: return of the king", but without the special effect but as good and better drama.we have the german, who dressed like kkk, conquered novgorod of russia. the russian summoned nevsky to lead them to fight the german to save russia. nikolai cherkasov, who played ivan in the ivan the terrible films, was charismatic as nevsky. the first 10 min how he handled the passing by mongol was captivating.many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. the anticipation of war did not require any dialogue such as "how many enemy we will be killing", etc. except for a few speeches, the film can basically be played out as a silent film. the fighting scene can hold up to those of the civil war fighting scene of the birth of a nation.another strength of the movie is the great musical score, by sergei prokofiev. the music gave an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue.

this is being commented on only because serge prokofiev(1891-1953)may not of known at first just how powerful a score and how actually majestic these lyrics really are.if you read the lyrics to alexander nevsky op.78 there is nothing here that is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all of musical literature.this film with its accompanying score have a special place in the world and that may be just as true on the internet as anywhere.the composers own website which is underwritten by his estate provides for additional care given such a score as this score truly deserves.it is to me as deep as it is wide with such boldness that you wish to be the one,the one they called great novgorod!this is a song about alexander nevsky.yes,it happened on the river neva-on the river neva,on the wide waters.there we slew our foes'pick of fighting men-there pick of fighting men,the army of swedes.ah!how we fought,how we routed them!ah!smashed their ships of war to kindling!in the fight our blood was freely shed for our great land,our native russian land.hey!where the broadaxe swung was as an open street,through their ranks a lane where spears ran!we mowed down the invading swedes like feather-grass grown on desert soil.we shall never yield native russian land.they who march on russia shall be put to death!rise against the foe,russian land,arise,rise to arms,great novgorod!(the call to arms goes on)arise to arms,ye russian folk,in battle just,in the fight to death,arise,ye people free and brave,defend our fair native land!to living warriors high esteem,immortal fame to warriors slain!for native home,for russian soil,arise ye people,russian folk!in our great native russia no foe shall live.rise to arms,arise,native mother russia!no foe shall march across russian land,no foreign troops shall raid russia,unseen are the ways to russia.no foe shall ravage russian fields.(here dear reader we are asked to live forever with the following verse)titled"the field of the dead"-i shall go across the snow-clad field,i shall fly above the field of death.i shall search for valiant warriors,my betrothed,my stalwart youths.here lies one felled by a wild saber,there lies one impaled by an arrow.from their wounds blood fell like rain on our native soil,on our russian fields.he who fell for russia in noble death shall be blest by my kiss on his dead eyes;and to him,brave lad,who remained alive i shall be a true wife and a loving friend.i'll not be wed to a handsome man,earthly charm and beauty fast fade and die.i'll be wed to the man who's brave,give ye heed to this,brave warriors!(now to its conclusion with nevskys entry into pskov)in a great campaign russia went to war.russia put down the hostile troops.in our native land no foe shall live.foes who come shall be put to death!celebrate and sing,native mother russia!in our native land foe men shall not live.foes shall never see russian towns and fields;they who march on russia shall be put to death! in our russia great,in our native russia no foe shall live!celebrate and sing,native mother russia!all of russia came in triumph to the celebration.celebrate and rejoice,russian motherland!- it should be noted that prokofiev was under quite a bit of pressure from stalin, to if you will, make good.this musical score was really very much approved of by stalin.to me there is a unmistakable beauty in how we love this world and nevsky tells of a hero whose god like attributes provides for all participation in that love.a truly beautiful and furtive telling of the story of alexander nevsky.

this is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings (a result of the date and location of its production)and accentuate the positive. in many ways this is a truly superb film.forgive the parody in the one line summary, but the most serious shortcoming for an english speaker like me was the ghastly subtitles. the print i saw had 1982 soviet "film export" subtitles, which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech. the actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images. given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength, this is a real issue.other imdb-niks have written plenty about the stalinist propaganda elements of this film (just in case the viewer doesn't notice them for him/herself). they have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene, which is superb in my view. the love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely..... almost totally lacks charm also. but it is good to cringe every now and then.i was familiar with the prokofiev music to this film long before seeing the film. the images and the music complement each other marvelously. and it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time. bergman clearly learned a lot from these images - the imagery of his medieval pieces (e.g. the seventh seal, the virgin spring) building upon and enhancing eisenstein's ideas. this film was made in 1938 in the ussr. in that context it is a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. for the modern viewer, i suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show.

(warning: spoilers! -- although it's hard to spoil this film by telling story details.)eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. it's very old and it's, er, clumsy. what makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original but the updated soundtrack. better still, the orchestral version prokofiev created (my favorite performance is by fritz reiner and the chicago symphony).the film is actually funny in places. it's reminiscent of the old "midsummer night's dream". some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. some of the actors are also quite magnificent. (the actor who played nevsky could have been a superstar today. ditto for the warrior chick, vasilisa -- definitely a rocker.) this may be the world's best collection, on film, of pithy russian sayings (there are tons of them -- they make up the bulk of the spoken lines).the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high-budget hollywood flix. these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be. the weapons look nasty, so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another.the actor playing the german "grand marshall" is trying *really* hard to look scary early in the film, but he looks like he was really a pussycat. after he's captured he looks *so* pathetic. (speaks volumes about the intended audience, da?)a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an *organ* with it, played by a character in a black robe. watch the russians bring this guy down *while* he's playing.after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film (and the music), the song sung to the dead soldiers who've died defending the motherland. this part is so sad it's almost an anti-war statement.ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film. wonder why?warning: joseph stalin liked this film. ironic -- he killed more russians than anybody. "those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword".

alexander nevsky is nothing short of a grand film on a grand scale. the film opens a window to a world and culture most americans will never become acquainted with. and much has been said and written regarding the film's thinly veiled patriotism in the face of imminent war with the german nazis.by us standards the acting is a bit stilted. the screenplay is short on words and big on visuals and action. and while the action can become tiresome, the visuals are often stunning. direction is incredible.on another note, fans of ralph bakshi animation might notice that he stole a lot of his visuals for wizards directly from a copy of alexander nevsky.

this movie has to be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by sergei prokofiev. obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. the cantata can be appreciated for itself, but having seen the movie helps.the story itself is fairly standard soviet wartime anti-german propaganda. an amusing anecdote is that stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing hitler at the onset of world war ii that eisenstein was seconded to a german movie for a short while, as penance.prince alexander nevsky (revered as a saint by the russian orthodox), having earned his nickname by defeating swedish raiders on the river neva, musters russian resistance against an invasion by the teutonic knights, and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would-be invaders.an interesting scene: alexander sees a convoy of russians being taken as slaves by mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, as the teutonic knights are his priority. the historical alexander nevsky paid tribute to the mongol khans, as his father before him, while working to consolidate his realm's future independence.

went looking for this movie after i read tom clancy's "red storm rising" novel. timeless masterpiece about 13th century russians being invaded by the germans. movie was made in 1938, under orders from joseph stalin to warn soviets about hitler and germany. battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great fight scene. probably sergei eisenstein's greatest work. also see 'battleship potemkin'. any history buff or poli-sci major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.

good film.i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. thing is the film is named "to kill for". it took a little detective work to find out it's original name.in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". having seen final destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.maybe the fact the delightful, traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. such a shame.traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions. she ability to turn what is branded a b-movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing.long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress.

in extramarital we see b-actress traci lords at her very best. she's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven's 'basic instinct' (1992), by the way. however, there are differences between the main female characters of traci lords ('99) and that of sharon stone ('92). for instance, in extramarital traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. we also shouldn't forget mentioning extramarital's three main actors. by putting down a convincing performance, each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie. all this makes extramarital into a very enjoyable b-movie. its storyline shows a good build-up, its tense being well-spread from start to finish. this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, until its unexpected end.

the movie was very good. i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it. i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. please know that while these poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp, ms. lemon and especially hastings! david suchet is definitely poirot. i have seen every actor who's played him. the worst was peter ustinov!

just after having moved into his new cottage in the english country, hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady angkatell, the owners of a large mansion nearby. but the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin, though the killer's plan is still very clever. it's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level. this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of "five little pigs" and "sad cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point, edward fox (as the butler) and sarah miles (as lady angkatell), though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead-of-her-time henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film. oh, and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case, i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one. (***)

this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow'. it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie's best but what makes 'the hollow' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell. what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy's dottiness, tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact, lucy is not really all that nice! megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda. john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.as i said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done. the whole thing looks beautiful as well, really capturing a perfect english autumn.its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing.

this movie deserves a 20/10 if i could give one. "the hollow" is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. there was no major difference that i could spot. the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. the acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! david suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either. in no other movie that i've seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! hats off to the producers-- they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come!

excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda (claire price) as well, of course, as david suchet. i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point. the ending, which i won't divulge (someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested.) i found really sad. despite agatha christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, i thought these really well-rounded by and large.the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke (cedric's son i believe in addition to being a well-known dr. watson.)) as her husband.

david suchet,(poirot),"foolproof",'03, gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. if he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection! you could just view the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior. the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking. megan dodds, "bait",2000, gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy, wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr. poirot. a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david suchet as mr. poirot!

i like the phrase "british post war suburban paranoia" that one of the reviewers used. it describes so well the kind of films john mills excelled in ("the october man" (1947), "the long memory" (1952)) in between "big" pictures ("scott of the antartic" (1948) and "war and peace" (1956)).this distinctly "eric ambler" style plot had john mills playing dr. howard latimer, who promises his friend, charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting german actress, frieda veldon (lisa daniely) at the airport. a creepy "reporter" jeffrey windsor (lionel jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend charles could not have rung him as he is still in new york and windsor doesn't seem to exist. earlier on a patient, mrs ambler(rene ray) who has been referred to him by doctor george kimber (mervyn johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector dane (roland culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of howard's daimler.when howard is lying low, robert brady (wilfred hyde-white) visits him. he calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches frieda gave howard at the airport. howard returns to the flat, charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! who can he trust - who hasn't something to hide!!!this is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "the october man", but with john mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!highly recommended.

the film is a remake of a 1956 bbc serial called'my friend charles',& as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time.i found it fast moving,enjoyable & unpretentious.did anyone else notice the scenes,towards the end,where john mills was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes-maybe censorship?,but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat,deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. the francis durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe,that of unexplained happenings,people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/victim.a predictable universe in some ways,but one with its own rules & regulations.

"the vicious circle" is a very unknown british mystery story. like many hitchcock movies, it's about a man who is being accused of a crime he didn't commit, and does everything he can to prove it. this time it's a dr. latimer (john mills), who finds a murdered german actress from his floor. as an honest man, the doctor calls scotland yard, which turns out to be a big mistake...there's really nothing special in this little movie. still, watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time. i enjoyed following the plot development. fine actors are a plus.

this is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining. nothing startling or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. i didn't really notice the acting which i guess is a good thing. john mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him. he would be clumped on the head, stand up 20 seconds later, dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened. a minor quibble in a film with a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion.

yes, i am sentimental, and yes, i love movies where kids are the better humans. true, klatretøsen does have some logical or even plot shortcomings. these are more than compensated by the kids' great acting (julias first movie role at all!) and the charm of a dogma film (i liked this kind of cinematografic art long before the dogma; ever since herzog's 'herz aus glas'). well, i cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than bambi or fly away home had for me.

klatret©ªsen(catch that girl) is really great movie! it's a 'happy' movie. i watched this movie in 'puchon international fantastic film festival(pifan)' on july 12nd, 2003. there is action + adventure + comedy + thrill + happy + romance(cute kids' love triangle!). you must see this movie. :)

i just saw this movie at the berlin film festival's children's program and it just killed me (and pretty much everyone else in the audience)! and make no mistake about it, this film belongs into the all-time-250! let me tell you that i'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this. no, but this actually is it! nevermind the "kid's-film" label on it, "klatretösen" ("climber girl") is on almost every account a classic (as in "biblical")! the story concerns 12-year old ida (magnetic: julie zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her daddy's terminal illness. special surgery in the us would cost 1.5 million and of course, nobody could afford that. so ida and her friends jonas and sebastian do what every good kid would - and burglarize a bank! sounds corny? don't forget: this is not america and "klatretösen" is by no means the tear-jerking robin-williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody takes seriously anyway. director fabian wullenweber set out to make a big-budget-action-comedy for kids and, boy, did he succeed! let me put it this way: this film rocks like no kid-film and few others did before. and there's a whole lot more to it than just the "action". after about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers-exposition (well, granted) it accelerates into a monster that:- effortlessly puts "mission impossible" to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive - take that, mummy!)- dwarves almost every other movie suspense-wise ( no easy-they're-only-kids-antics here )- easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives- nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds- comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p.c. that i can hear the american ratings board wet their pants from over here- manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am i saying?? they're kids! they're kids! - nevermind, watch that last scene!)- stars stafan pagels anderson, who since last years "mirakel" is everybody's favourite kid actorwhat a ride!

this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. it is a movie both for children and parents, and it is "timeless". i saw this movie before ocean's eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance, but the play of klatretøsen is much more down-to-earth and moving. why i say ocean's eleven, is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and klatretøsen is that good ! that it can bear comparison with oe. the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in denmark. the different cases of impossible acts, is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors (and sometimes not even from the "old boys"). the story ? again it has things in common with ocean's eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom. the part in which the young people has to take care of ida's younger brother, gives a fine element in the movie. try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy, on your arm :-).this movie can bear comparison with most "grown up" movie like mi2 and ocean's eleven. yes i do believe it is that good. it is best to see it in a theater, as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-).regards klavs.

this satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. but even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of hitler (here cleverly renamed as "hynkel", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-german), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. and the actors aren't even exaggerating that much i suppose. one of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. it's not even really the character talking anymore, it's chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. if you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. and the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing i don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era i suppose. this is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.

in a better civilization, this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters. the plots are fabulous (no, i'd no clue who had done it, but the clues were all there if i'd been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values astounding, the acting (from edward fox, sarah miles, lysette anthony, megan dodds, and of course david suchet as hercule poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! here were have two - the sexy sinuous megan doods and the stunning lysette anthony.you really can't go wrong renting these - they're just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.i can't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot/david suchet movies. it's impossible to over-praise them - and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie.

this was charlie chaplin's first all-talking film. yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, modern times, but it was still essentially a silent film. so, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on film.the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. while i enjoyed the film, i was not nearly as impressed by this as chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. that's because i really felt annoyed by some of chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played adenoid hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. the silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the three stooges). plus, playing a funny hitler is hard for me to take.however, when chaplin played the jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. this film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. the final speech by the barber (impersonating hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. watch the film for this reason alone.

great comedy from charlie chaplin. i've seen chaplin's 4 major films (gold rush, city lights, modern times, and the great dictator), and i think it is easily the funniest of the four. this movie had me laughing more than almost any other i've ever seen. from the very opening disclaimer ("any similarity between the great dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental") the movie is a laugh-a-minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. and at the same time, chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting timeliness of the subject matter, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.

this was chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. the movie is a biting satire of hitler and mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the jews. it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm.when compared to chaplin's earlier works, this is quite pale in comparison. the sweet, funny style of his silents, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. if this was a silent, it probably would not have happened.i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance. one of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both chaplin's history and movie history. it is flawed, but chaplin is in great form.

most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism, made at the height of those movements' success.sadly, in the final moments of the film, chaplin abandons all pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. and not anti-nazi propaganda, either, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywood.never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message.

written, produced and directed by charlie chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-nazi propaganda piece, skewering adolf hitler.chaplin plays adenoid hynckel, the dictator of tomania, as well as a jewish barber who is hynckel's spitting image. his parody of hitler is brilliant. anyone who has ever seen newsreels of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slap-stick focussing on the first world war adventures of the jewish barber. having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about. but the movie picks up steam quickly. there are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-jewish nature of "hynckel-ism" to make the propaganda point. the climax of the film is a brilliant anti-nazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the movie.as good as chaplin is in this movie, though, i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack oakie, playing the dictator of "bacteria" - "benzino napaloni." our first look at oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. the scenes in which hynckel and napaloni negotiate over the fate of "osterlich" had me in stitches.this was a very good movie, and well worth watching.

although i haven't seen it yet, i know that chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about hitler. all great satire is based on going out on an edge. also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. this film seems like it will skirt both sides. like kubrick's dr. strangelove, the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. and hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground, and fando and lis. so, let me watch the film first.

a good, but not great film, "the great dictator" is chaplin's first talkie. it's a good effort, and at times a remarkable satire on hitler, but unfortunately the moments of chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. yes, chaplin, the silent screen master, just uses too many words in this film, and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films, such as (better) "limelight". still, chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable. paulette goddard doesn't have the glow she did in "modern times" (her off-screen affair with chaplin was cooling at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and jack oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to chaplin's famous creation hynkel.

this must have been one of chaplin's most ambitious projects; he throws in virtually everything, from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. the mixture is challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (like the one where chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together, and the mix (and tone) seem kind of disharmonious. as for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to "a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality, and his soul will fly". great perfornmances by jack oakie and the beautiful paulette goddard. (***)

being quite a fan of charlie chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'the gold rush' and then 'city lights', i was eager to see 'the great dictator' as i had been told this was, arguably, his best film. i was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, chaplin-wise.the start is typical chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. it was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. what was also well done was the way in which hitler is spoofed. any scene involving hitler or 'hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. the way in which english in mixed in with the mock german during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. my favourite joke was the five minute speech hynkel gave, only for the english translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.historically, the film got a few things right as well. hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at hitler's underhand technique of winning over the german public through sympathy (oh, he hugs and kisses children. he must be ok!). the film is also given a fantastic premise of a jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. films such as 'the pianist' and 'come and see' are two good examples of nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.what i didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. this slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. the film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. these included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. the 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.during the final straight, the great dictator gets a boost from the fact the italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. it works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact i felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, the great dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.

chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator adenoid hynkel, (i.e hitler) a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be "reeducated"a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. this was the last movie with chaplin's trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9

the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot. it' s set on a country house on a weekend. as always all the guests are suspects and it's up to poirot to figure out the truth. with movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so i'll stop here. what i loved in the `hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. everybody seems to be the culprit. there's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story.you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised. a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience.the actors are all very good. as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr. watson in sherlock holmes. nice to see him after a few years. suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time.i did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and it's also very believable.so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure.

okay, it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself. still, "the great dictator" is a fascinating movie. chaplin does a terrific job satirizing hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the jews in nazi germany (this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge). not a chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing.

i first saw this movie back in the early 90's,and instantly fell in love with it.richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie "saturday the 14th"in 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983.i think they work quite well together.this movie made me laugh on several occasions.it also has a young molly ringwald,who would later go on in the late 1980's to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candles.it is fun watching her a little younger.although not seen by many people..i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie.but when i first came acrossed it i was glad i did.i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.lastly i would like to say its not available on dvd,so i picked up a vhs copy on ebay,so if your interested,you probably can find one on there.it might be in the $20-$30 dollar range but i got mind for $12 bucks.i wish they would eventually release this on dvd.

...and i'm so disappointed because i can't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere.its a kind of mix of, uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. this was made when molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink.i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! if anyone has a copy of this, or knows where i can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.

this has to be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness. when mom and dad both lose there jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. they decide it's in their families best interest to move to oregon. once there everything goes wrong. an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. including a young molly ringwald,this a movie i would definetly recommend.

the story is about a working girl (ann sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (paul kelly). this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late. the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate. so, not wanting to just stay home, she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (neil hamilton). sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a "love 'em and leave 'em" sort of guy. how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict--just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures--with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars. it's clearly a "b-movie" despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwell--as both had yet to become famous. now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good. in fact, given the production values, this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline. that's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across. plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. the ending, in particular, is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! because of these factors, the film earns a 7 of 10.

"blind date" is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author vida hurst. lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk. he seems to be in the film for comedic and homey "family values". jane darwell again plays the strong-willed mother, just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident. ann sothern is kitty, who has been dating bill (paul kelly), but meets up with rich bob hartwell, played by neil hamilton, who may or may not be better for her. you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code -- at one point, kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior, when anything and everything was ok. good solid plot, but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice, or just find a man with big bucks, as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman..... also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer, who was 20 years older; rooney ended up being married eight times. tyler brooke (emory) and spencer charters (pa) both knocked themselves off in real life. the title "blind date" has been reused many times, for films, tv series, and even cartoons, but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.

working girl kitty (sothern) is engaged to bill (kelly), who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage. after being stood up on her birthday, kitty goes on a double-date/blind date, where she meets department store heir bob hartwell (hamilton). she falls in love, but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress, rather than his wife. faithful bill rallies 'round to comfort her, and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement, pressured in part by bill's support of her family after she loses her job. when bob returns, however, convinced that he wants marriage after all, will kitty follow her heart or her conscience? this film was a lot better than i'd expected it to be. the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic irishman type that jack carson played so often. but kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love, and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group. viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless hartwell! the tone of the film wavers, however, between light-hearted romance and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at bill's garage.the cast is rounded out by the dependable jane darwell as kitty's mother, an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as kitty's younger brother, and spencer charters as kitty's ne'er-do-well father.

i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo drafthouse in austin. he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was hilarious. i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i'd pee. they don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh god...you will die. oh and jim brown is brilliant. he's not in a lot of the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie it is. naturally, the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; you'll know it when you hear it.

this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.you have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. when the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money, she becomes brown's property. then she's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for.as if this isn't enough reason to see this movie, you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor, but he's really a major crack dealer. in a sleazy yet hilarious scene, he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix. in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor. that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical. lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film. tarantino, bring her back.it's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this. it has just the right blend of comedy, action, sex, romance, and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. jim brown's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's b villain, wings hauser in vice squad. sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged. in the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor.

crack house (1989) was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre. what's supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity. there's nothing wrong with that however. the video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show richard "turncoat" roundtree,the movie follows two young lovers in high school. one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. one of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends. jim brown appears as the movie's "mister big", he's one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word. luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well.if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you. sadly, hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do, it's neither exploitative nor entertaining.recommended for sleaze fans.

when i first got wind of this picture, it was just called "shepherd" and was supposed to be the film that would put jcvd back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff. i was very well excited about the whole piece.by the time it was titled "the shepherd: border patrol," i was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick. with isaac fluorentine at the helm of directing, and jj perry pulling stunt coordination, i almost peed me pants in anticipation. pics were released of jcvd kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as scott adkins playing what i thought was the villain, and i was mind-blown in excitement. i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf mcquade.then it came out. i ordered it off blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything. the reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered, but i braced myself. the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package. my initial plan was to rush upstairs, rip the face off the cardboard packaging, then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player. however, i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.by the time it was over, i was cool as a fool in the pool. the shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is. sure, some of the fights ran a twee bit short, but they were still very awesome. the shootouts were superb, as was scott adkins, who should have been the villain, unlike the forgettable steven lord.i highly recommend this flick. seriously.

van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico. ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america (usa), van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look. i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better. keep them coming van damme.watch this film if you enjoyed films like - until death, the hard corps and second in command.

this movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. i only knew about it because i am a long time jean-claude van damme fan and i always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (derailed, second in command), they are. this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme, scott adkins and the final one of them together. the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but isaac florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately (in hell, wake of death, until death) but with the good acting came less martial arts. in the shepherd, van damme proves that he still has it.

i like the shepherd! sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. the story was average. a texas cop battles smugglers. this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. van damme was never a good actor. i think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. if you're looking for an oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great. van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. this movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan.

i have not seen a van damme flick for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it, looking older, but tougher, kind of like sly, becomes more rugged with age. this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years. i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot. van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences, the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire, that was a good flick as well. in addition, i looked in to van damme's early fighting history, i too my amazement i realized he is the real deal, very accomplished martial artist in his younger years.

after 10 years, it is finally save to say that our belgian action star is back again. i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death, which makes it his best movie in... 10 years!! okay, it is not like his highlight years as timecop, universal soldier, sudden death or even his best effort to date: hard target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo.) the action is good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite funny, this one is better than expected.the bad guys are awesome like in hard target, and the fight scenes are "old school". real fans know what to expect. i must say, i gave up on him, but van damme is finally back. more please....

like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career.in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol. haunted by memories of his past, it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex-navy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the u.s. that killed his daughter.overall i found this film to be very good, van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move. the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing. unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago, regardless the shepherd: border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general; the shepherd: border control is a great movie, not as good as until death but better than the hard corps. be sure to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed.

i thought that this was the most interesting film that jcvd has done in a very long time. i loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. imho, jcdv may really be on to something going forward. a little more light heartedness, some obvious homages to other films, mixed in with some great fights...i would like to see more this style of film-making from him. one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a desperado rip off. i immediately saw the r. rodriguez connection also, but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films. jcvd rocks!!other stuff after reading other comments:no music in the dungeon fight? at first i didn't like that at first either, but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect. made it seem more real.i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was "stolen" from the studio. directors are paid to do a job. the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want. very few directors have absolute final cut on a film. in this case, jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. i am sure he got a film that he was happy with. i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story. presumably, the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. everyone who saw it said it was a disaster...then jcvd and the studio re edited the movie. this stuff happens all the time. he also did see the final cut (which he claims he didn't) and his "delicate genius" ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut. if this director was smart, he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best.

it's really good to see van damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c-grade flops "derailed" and "second in command" which were both tragic and not in a good way. the sheperd: border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. it's good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film "until death" had no martial arts in it at all!!!that being said, this film is significantly inferior to "until death" which was a really good turn for van damme. "until death" lacked the over-the-top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. still, the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. the only real problem i have with this film is the title; "the shepherd"? i don't get it! i suppose "border patrol" just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word "shepherd" in front of it!!!my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by van damme movie standards not in any other film category.i.e. it's good for a van damme film.

first of all, nothing will ever compare to the original movie, but for gosh sakes, they're not trying to. it is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after rhett left scarlett at tara. i for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my gwtw collection. the scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. just view this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace vivian leigh and clark cable and you will enjoy it a lot. they really captured the spoiled selfishness of scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from rhett that he is clearly still in love with scarlett. the fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on tv. i always wanted them to have other children after bonnie blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly. lore60

 it's common knowledge and has been said before: no one can ever play scarlett and rhett like vivien leigh and clark gable. joanne whalley kilmer (no longer kilmer having been divorced from ex-hubby val kilmer) plays her own scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re-make (god-forbid!!!) she still cannot rise to the occasion (i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she's got brown eyes [scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even vivien leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. scarlett is a southern belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in scarlett the novel and gwtw, of course) and to be a great flirt like scarlett is, you would most likely need a higher-pitched voice, like vivien leigh. i suppose i'm comparing kilmer to leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as leigh did with scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective scarletts. timothy dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both margaret mitchell's rhett and gable in the film had none. his acting has never been truly noteworthy (except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving king phillip of france in the lion in winter) and he gives very little (if any) freshness or vitality to his rhett.  standouts in the cast are most notably tina kellagher (a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim mary boyle. and then of course there's sean bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil lord fenton, mary's nemesis and scarlett's eventual violator. one thing i could not forgive the writer for was the fact that scarlett is raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; lord fenton is cold and of ill-repute among the irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of belle watling, played most horribly by ann-margret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a run-away bestseller without requiring any assistance from ms. watling. for a film by itself, scarlett is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being gone with the winds sequel. another actress was highly necessary for scarlett as well as rhett.

i've always loved "gone with the wind" and have seen it numerous times. however, its ending left me not only "hanging," but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. finally, in "scarlett," ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying end ("beginning") of the original story.it follows that someone of scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. although, like most people, i fell in love with scarlett in gwtw, i tired of her constant insipid infantiilism to the point of exasperation, and i was disappointed that mitchell did not show scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally. thankfully, someone finally did. (after all, isn't that nagging immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason rhett finally gave up on her in the first place?) i think ripley did an excellent job of describing that long-overdue process, and whalley-kilmer did a superb job of portraying it. joanne w-k has all the fire, exuberance and intelligent sparkle as did vivian leigh, and she is certainly at least as, if not more, beautiful.there was, is, and always will be only one clark gable. however, if i had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which i've been exposed to portray him in his biography, it would definitely be timothy dalton. dalton possesses the same elegant charm that gable did, which is essential for rhett's character. i can't imagine anyone else who could come close.in my opinion, both joanne whalley-kilmer and timothy dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played scarlett and rhett. i think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their characters.i enjoyed the whole cast. julie harris was her usual delightful presence, and jean smart was an adorable kick! even ashley's character was nicely played by stephen collins, and the progression of his relationship with scarlett was totally believable.the story became a little convoluted in ireland, but so is life, after all, and i still found it entertaining.all in all, i thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of ripley's imagination. i wish i'd written it!

i didn't read the book "scarlett" and when i watched this mini series i enjoyed it very much and thought it didn't need to be compared to gwtw. the story may differ from the book, but who cares its a movie. even in the credits its based on the book, its not the book. the film is clearly under appreciated with the reviews that other people write but can't even spell the main characters names right. the acting in scarlett i thought was superb. joanne whalley and timothy dalton were excellent. they took the characters and gave them there touch. now as far as other people go by, they compare them to the great vivian leigh and clark gable. they obviously did fantastic, but the leads in this film are completely different people who have there own acting methods and shouldn't be pressured of what people have to say. if you wanted certain actors to do well then you should have directed the film, i'm sure that other actors would not do as well as these with the chemistry and cleverness they brought to these roles. the supporting cast stood out with there grandness, and jean smart steals the scenes that shes in with her comedy genius. the locations in the film were very beautiful and it was just grand to see scarlett go to all those places in the film as she causes trouble and other things. also the scene in which scarlett talks to her dad's grave it was very dramatic and i thought from then on that there were two great actresses who brought scarlett o'hara to life. not just vivian leigh but also joanne whalley.the film and the book may differ, but you must not take to heart that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made otherwise you will think that this has to be like gone with the wind and you will not like this film. but this is an under rated classic that is unlike gwtw, its its own movie. also keep in mind that "tomorrow is another day"...

following on directly from the last episode of the previous series yes minister.jim hacker now finds himself inside number 10 downing street as prime minister of great britain, instead of a cabinet minister and a member of the government, he is now leading her majesty's government.all this after some scheming maneuvers by sir humphrey appleby after the previous prime minister resigned at the end of yes minister. sir humphrey appleby is now the head of the civil service.i thought that this series was better than the first series, or though it did not last as long as the first series unfortunately.

james hacker mp didn't expect that he would be the next prime minister. unlike in america, the party is elected in britain while we, americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. despite the differences, paul eddington cbe's performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior adviser, sir humphrey, played by another knight, sir nigel hawthorne, and veteran actor derek fowlds also returns to the scene as well. now instead of pleasing some people, he has to please the nation rather than his constituency. now, he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before. now, he must approve the honors list and work with her majesty as well on a regular basis. hacker is not the hacking type. he is rather than the every man who we like and don't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator. now, we see the prime minister's point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes.

hadnt heard a lot about this movie, except it being national award and oscar entry. its a marathi movie, n i cant make out apple from orange in marathi. but when i saw the movie playing on dd1 late sunday night, i just got glued. now i am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills. but i have watched a good number of movies, of various genres, and for an average viewer, i will highly recommend this movie. the feel is very earthy and realistic, though there are some melodramatic moments. watch it to feel human. lately haven't seen any movie, which touches heart, especially in hindi cinema. the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home. the camera moves around to reveal the kid, wearing black glasses, having lost his eyes, the kid hears the other kids splashing in the water and starts clapping. i was awestruck. and the two hours i spent watching the movie - very much worth it :-)

it was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. the director maintained focus on the main subject without venturing into side plots (the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients), that are so typical of bollywood assembly-line products. he kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray. the rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the movie a feel of genuineness. i am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of anand or safar. a couple of scenes toward the end of the movie, such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy claps at the sound of splashing and birds chirping are sure make your eyes misty.many bollywood players do not realize that oscar committee members value simplicity of the subject and genuineness and brevity of the movie more than the glitz and glamor. shwaas is certainly a better nomination than lagaan, which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death. no mpaa member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and a lot of song and dance.i look forward to more movies from director sandeep sawant in the future.

it was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989, as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960's - the acting, the characterisations, the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier time.the film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the a-bomb on hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: a young woman, yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but emotive and effective nonetheless, the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific. family members become unrecognisable to each other, others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shock.the title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which yasuko is caught. rumors of yasuko's being in hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospects and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing sicknesses. the film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the japanese, but on the social and psychological damage that was wrought.i found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. while the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family, the film's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time - wars have horrific consequences, and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary. it is said that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the 'coalition of the willing' have learned nothing. while atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly after-effects have. this film is compelling viewing.

i didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful). i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family. imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you. i was really wrenching to see yasuko being rejected as "tainted" by the bomb. the image that stays with me most is when yasuko stands before the mirror combing her hair, silently watching it come out in clumps.

black rain is a superb film, but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as $300 apiece. i have the dvd, and it's terrible. very tiny non-anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution-killing size. acceptable sound. this is a primitive dvd that absolutely *has* to be rereleased.btw, i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain. the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd! and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them allsubtitles in the black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack. buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding!

this is a pretty faithful adaptation of masuji ibuse's novel, "black rain." like the book it is very moving and thought-provoking. the story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married. they are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness, after walking through hiroshima on the day of the bombing. well filmed, well acted, moving, tragic, horrifying and funny.

after the atomic bomb hits hiroshima, charred bodies lie all around, deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. this black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor. the story revolves around a young woman yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. she is trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying, and people are worried the same will happen to her. after finding a suitable mate (who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan, it will frighten you, and will perhaps make you cry. the acting is good, not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made.

shohei imamaura's black rain was released in 1989 just at the onset of the aids epidemic, a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of hiroshima radiation victims an added poignancy. the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout, and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one. based on a novel by masuji ibuse who gathered information from interviews and the diaries of real-life bomb victims, the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion. it is a horrifying vision but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. the film begins in hiroshima on august 6, 1945 as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities. suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard. almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history. survivors must somehow restart their lives, unaware of the bomb's devastating after effects. filmed in high-contrast black and white, the story centers around yasuko (yoshiko tanaka), a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives. in hiroshima, imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a young boy with skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him, an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of debris, a mother is in torment as she rocks the blackened body of her child.when the family returns to their rural home, yasuko's life is forever changed. she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle shigematsu shimuza (kazuo kitamura) and aunt shigeko shimuza (etsuko ichihara). pretending that there is only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb has affected yasuko. "she forgot how hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed. everyone forgot it. they forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival. i'm sick of it," says a friend katayama (akiji kobayashi). yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being contaminated.when her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband, the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her health, even though shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she wasn't directly exposed to the bomb. the only suitor she feels comfortable with is another damaged man, yuichi (keisuke ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. at the end, the beauty of life shows itself ever so fleetingly when yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life, the king carp jumping in the water, playfully as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy. sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war. "human beings learn nothing", says shigematsu. "they strangle themselves. unjust peace is better than a war of justice. why can't they see?" immamura's black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly.

it infuriates me no end that, now and forever, i will have to identify this movie (which i consider a masterpiece, and i don't use that word lightly) with the qualifier "not the michael douglas movie!" not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing- the radioactive fallout that rained upon the survivors of the first nuclear bombings. in imamura's film, this is no cheap metaphor; the whole movie is about the fallout, physical and emotional, from hiroshima and the war itself. as the deterioration of a couple and their grown niece becomes more grimly clear, the ironic imagery becomes more potent, from the old clock that is reset each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the heroine's door. (these, in turn, are carved by a shellshocked veteran who is compelled, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with a motor that approaches the town.) the bombing day itself is shown in piecemeal flashbacks that are coolly horrifying. yet "black rain" ("ntmdm!") can be watched, even repeatedly, because of imamura's compassion for his characters. i repeat: a masterpiece.

i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen. i know that on this website it's received only negative reviews, but for once i'd like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review. i find the movie to be extremely funny, and it has the perfect mix of everything. it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it, and i can't get enough of it. the soundtracks brilliant. i love it, i understand why people may not love it as much as i do, but i don't understand how people could hate it. the movie is 100% brilliance. blurred is amazing. i never realised that aussie movies could be so good, and i also never realised i could watch one movie, so many times in a single day without getting sick of it. i think that everybody should watch it, whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days, or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12.

wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently. actually, wales seems to be developing its own little film industry. i recently saw very annie mary, which i thought was very good. but plots with a view is not only quirky, it's laugh out loud funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (brenda blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not entirely original, is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines. it was the kind of movie that i wanted to watch again immediately it was over, and one of very few that i would actually like to own. even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have been to a welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the rapport between blethyn and molina is a joy to behold.

i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it is hilariously funny from start to finish. the plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. when i went to see this movie i hadn't heard much about it and i didn't know what to expect. i thought it was going to be an old ladies' type of film like calendar girls or something but it took me completely by surprise. even though i am still a teenager and the film was probably not directed at my age group, i still found it excellent and i think that people of all age groups would like it. i think it is a shame that it is not at all famous and it deserves more publicity so that more people will go and see it and realize what a great movie it is.

i accidentally bumped into this film on cinemax while channel surfing. i must admit that what attracted me was christopher walken. and the setting was the kind i would like, so i started to watch it. at first i expected a serious drama film, and it seemed like so for a while... until i started to giggle here and there, and before i know it i was laughing so hard all through the film. i really like how subtle and light-hearted it is, but still has a huge impact on the audience. the plot is very simple, and it's far from trying too hard to be funny like many hollywood "comedies" are, yet it almost had me rolling on the floor. a must see for a nice evening rest, or any time in that case.

a humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business. it's easy watching, and even offers blethyn & molina stealing a scene from an old fred & ginger movie. walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of molina in the undertaking business, trying to bring a new style to an old welsh town. we see a couple of very funny examples of the "new style". the plot thickens with pugh having an affair with watts, and her suggesting that they do blethyn in. meanwhile molina has rekindled his long suffering romantic feeling for blethyn, and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the south seas, and dance away their days together. during the "fake" funeral blethyn learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge. watch it for a view of what funerals probably should be--a celebration of life!

two funeral directors in a welsh village? english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic? how could i resist. my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs. we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening.the mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait. it raises issues rarely talked about in the community, but i know three funeral directors, and the humour is right on the moneyhighly recommended and congratulations to the writers. without you all the actors, directors and the others havn't a job on any monday.

hilarious from start to finish, there's got to be great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile, specially when two funeral parlors are battling for control of the market: a classic parlor and a revolutionary one where every funeral is a show, lead by christopher walken, a treat in the role of the visionary american mortitian. but the rest of the cast is great also, and this one is another success that only uk is capable of making. surprising among the ensemble cast is naomi watts, that strikes in another metamorphosis (accent included). always sporting a smile on its face, it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called "four funerals and one wedding", but you'll understand when you see it.

i saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the u.s. nonetheless, it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies. it concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small british town. the plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable.the acting is great across the board. sure to be overlooked in the crunch of blockbusters, this is a movie worth looking out for. i know i will try to catch this in the theaters again and/or buy the video.

this movie is one of the funniest i have seen in years. a movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing, or irreverant. christopher walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and i could hardly breathe for laughing so hard.i saw the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but cheered. i am telling all my friends to watch for it's arrival in the usa. i definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on dvd as soon as it's available.

once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor, not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house. too bad.brenda blethyn (who i first saw in saving grace early in the year, another must see by the way.) just excels, as alfred molina does. the rest of the cast, while virtually unknown to me, turns on great performances too. the film starts slowly and gradually gains in pace and amusement - midway i had tears in my eyes from laughing.all in all, a funny english movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny' garbage that comes from hollywood.

very lovely love story between brenda blethyn and alfred molina. the whole story is very bizarre and funny. an undertaker (a. molina) loves a married woman (b.blethyn). they try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village. a scenario of strange situations starts. as good as saving grace and long live ned devine.

i found this a very enjoyable light hearted comedy set in wales with some truly funny sequences highlighting the rivalry between two funeral directors. the showbiz ideas used by christopher walken's character to liven up his funerals are genuinely laugh out loud moments.

this was the film that started that the cinematic love affairbetween the jaundiced eye crew and matthew ferguson. hisability to portray relatively normal characters like birkoff in"la femme nikita" is counter-balanced by his equally defthandling of weirdos like "kane." one wishes that he would onlybe given more roles, bigger roles, and other, even more complexroles to assay to push the limits of his abilities. there werefour or five memorable scenes in this film, and matthew fergusonstole two of them from far more experienced actors. this filmitself is good, and it is worth watching on its own merits, butferguson makes it a little extra special. his *ouevre* mayeventually show what the career of anthony perkins might havebeen like if he hadn't been typecast as "norman bates" so longago. "kane" isn't quite as whacked-out as norman, and far fewerpeople saw "love and human remains than saw "psycho," so we canhope that ferguson will show us some hint of what perkins mighthave been able to accomplish, had he been allowed to do so. . . .

watched this flick on saturday afternoon cable. man, did it drag. i got the metaphors, symbolism, and all that stuff. no, i didn't care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. but, the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep.that is..... until ruth marshall got naked. if you're a breast-man who is not homo-phobic, you may want to rent it. ruth has a lesbian sex scene that's pretty hot, and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare. her jiggly d-cups made the film worth the watch.--the mighty avatar

there is, as many reviews have observed, a strong dark streak to this movie. the director it most recalls to me is john landis (yeah, go ahead and howl about what a peasant i am). arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak, gray kind of way, then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch.the cast is, without exception, above average. thomas gibson, as david, is outstanding as the moody and self-deceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve. he talks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. it was difficult to look at him and see greg montgomery, let alone agent hotchner of criminal minds.perhaps not the best scene, but the one i enjoy most, my "rewind scene," is the section where candy is expecting a visitor, and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door. as candy's interpersonal environment swings further and further out of control, david just grows bouncier, perkier, and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt gen-x "tigger."

i first watched this movie in istanbul film festival back in 1994. it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week. the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing. it sure is a very powerful gay movie. some scenes make you feel you're watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines. i guess i'll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight...

i bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99p an it's been sitting in my video bookcase for at least a year now. then tonight i decided to see it, the film was quite different to what i had expected and i didn't find any humour in it all i saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and i didn't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film. i felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. i was following her emotions and what happened around her. some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but i could really put myself in her place, loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try. i thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well. i was expecting something like bound & gagged : a love story, but this is a very different film. not for bigots.

extremely good cinematic story of gay, embittered former teen star, now waiting tables. the sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically, and with an actual human face. this, and throw in a serial killer on the loose, and you have love and the human remains. a well portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. the screenplay is fluid and believable. the performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are sharp.this certainly isn't everyone's ideal notion of a movie, but for those who appreciate something different and slickly written, it's very much worthy of your time. highly recommended.

once again, i am amazed that thomas gibson did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career. in this film, gibson once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th century. tender yet not effeminate, afraid of the basic tenets of love, gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. also worthy of praise is cameron bancroft's performance. his need to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friend's "homosexual conquests" provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected. bancroft and gibson's chemistry is apparent from the first scene they appear in together. there are many "panels" in this quilt. from gay relationships to straight relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer at its core. my only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before i discovered this movie! i look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend it to any fan of bancroft, gibson or director denys arcand.

yes, this film has many gay characters. it also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence. this is not a film about sexual orientation. it's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another. filmically, denys arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships. the serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed). thomas gibson centers and grounds the film; it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him. the supporting cast is strong, especially mia kirshner as gibson's friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness. the film's involving and often surprises in its character development. the effect is somewhat like robert altman directing a david mamet script---the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning. often, in our search for love and a conventional "relationship", we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. arcand and the writer, brad fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.this film is a rewarding experience. it may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. loneliness is a universal experience. a film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.

i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie, but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie. the character of gust,played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman, was one of the most unique, yet entertaining characters in recent memory. this movie informed,yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive, and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie. it takes no time to understand what is going on, and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine, human emotion. i thought i knew my history, apparently i didn't know it at all! i give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it for all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, just not the young. but as soon as they are allowed to see "r" rated movies, make it a priority.

charlie wilson (tom hanks) is a hard-partying, womanizing texas congressman with no discernible legislative record. in 1980, he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the ussr. on the auspices of his old flame, arch-conservative texas socialite joanne herring (julia roberts), he travels to afghanistan to assess the situation, and is stunned by what he sees. he returns to the us determined to help the afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use. undeterred, wilson recruits herring and the vulgar, outcast cia agent gust avrakotos (phillip seymour hoffman) to begin a convoluted arms deal involving israel, egypt, pakistan, saudi arabia, and a mostly unknowing us congress. ultimately, the afghans defeat the soviets, but while america celebrates their victory, wilson and avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war afghanistan falling on deaf ears.charlie wilson's war is slick brain candy, a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average film-goer. the movie assembles an astonishing array of talent, both in front of and behind the camera, and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time. the film's has only one flaw, which we'll arrive at later. as an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th century's largest covert war was waged - and, perhaps, the way that things get done by the cia and other intelligence agencies - it's fascinating.the movie is interesting on a number of levels. the story portrayed in the movie - with all of its outrageous double-dealings, sneaky covert operations, and, perhaps most of all, its success - would be so outrageous as a work of fiction, that it could easily be dismissed as a satire. but things really did work out this way, at least within reasonable bounds. the film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws. wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices (even embracing them) - yet willing to embrace a righteous cause. herring is something of an elitist, and her born-again attitude of righteousness is off-putting - yet she's deeply committed to the cause of the afghan people. avrakotos is a cia outsider with an attitude problem, looked down upon because of his "street" background - yet his love of country and hatred of communism are unwavering. the fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the ussr is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that truth is stranger than fiction. it's also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy - not too surprising, given that our writer is aaron sorkin, but it's an interesting way to approach this story.the movie does, however, have one drawback, which is a bit surprising. the film seems to unabashedly celebrate wilson and co.'s achievement. this is fine - nothing wrong with defeating the soviet union, is there? - until one considers that out of the ashes of the soviet defeat in afghanistan came the taliban and eventually al-qaeda. regardless of the us's level of responsibility, it happened, and the movie's portrayal of wilson's success is almost unmitigated. to be fair, the movie does address this issue towards the end, with a rather topical speech by wilson about the us's inability to clean up after themselves, but it's done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it. the overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the afghans defeat the soviets. this isn't a fatal drawback, mind you, but it's one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. the film's talent is remarkable. the legendary mike nichols delivers a slick, gorgeous-looking production; the material is perfectly suited to his understated, wry directorial style. sorkin delivers yet another brilliant screenplay; the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic sorkin exchanges (the best being the "scotch bottle" discussion between wilson and avrakotos), and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it. the film's cast is a marvel: tom hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause, julia roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed joanne, and phillip seymour hoffman steals every scene (par usual) as the abrasive gus. the always-lovely amy adams takes another step on her road to stardom as wilson's long suffering assistant, and ned beatty, om puri, emily blunt, christopher denham, and ken stott flesh out the supporting cast.charlie wilson's war is an intelligent and fun movie, a wonderful bit of a-bit-more-than-light entertainment. the fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldn't be held against it; it's brilliant at what it does.8/10

recap: based on the true story of charlie wilson, an american congressman, who (according to this movie) was instrumental in usa's covert war in afghanistan against the soviet union.comments: a rather funny movie about not so funny things, especially since they were real. but focusing on the movie, hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan. hanks, and the entire movie, philip seymor hoffman especially, has a rather humorous tone. so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. but, the story that it tell, and maybe the ending the most, are serious indeed.a story of what happened with some questions about what might have been. so the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want that. something for everybody? 7/10

great film, a very worthy 7/10.tom hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors! based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away. well, it did go away, albeit temporarily. look who we (the british, amongst others) are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms, training and money to in the 80s.this film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it, but it does portray a very nice story. however, once the main objective is achieved, i.e. ridding the communists from afghanistan, it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about.this film was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well. although being a good film, i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good (us) v evil (russia) isn't your thing!

... with a single act.charlie wilson, congressman, a real character. during the 90s, when the communism on ussr, the wall of berlin and the war on afhganistan (with the soviets) broke over. he did it, a single denial for money, and everything went down. he should be remembered, so here it is. his memorial.back to the movie. funny, dramatic, snob, politic or just boring. anyways, it's a smart movie about politic life, about ruling the world and about, above all, a lesson to the world. a lesson to every politic out there, a critical point of view referring to countries who support wars with money, guns and words.lesson learned - world isn't a nice place to live in

charlie wilson (two time oscar-winner:tom hanks) is a easy-going congressman... who loves to party, enjoys the company of woman and especially drinking his booze. when charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend joanne herring (oscar-winner:julia roberts) wants charlie to visit afghanistan, which that country certainly need of help. charlie is shocked of what he seen, especially from all different ages are killed or hurt from this war with the russians. he decides to help the people and the rebels to fight the russians, who started the war. charlie, joanne and one renegade cia agent by the name of gust avrakotos (oscar-winner:philip seymour hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the largest covert operation in history.directed by oscar-winner:mike nichols (the birdcage, regarding henry, wolf) made an lively, entertaining sharp satire war comedy that is based on a true story. hanks, roberts, hoffman in a oscar nominated performance and amy adams as charlie's loyal assistant are very good in their roles. despite the excellent true-life premise, "charlie wilson's war" never really catches fire and it is not as wickedly funny as you liked it to be. director nichols and screenwriter:aaron sorkin (a few good men) keeps things moving and the characters are well liked throughout.dvd has an sharp pan & scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd's only special features are the behind the scenes featurette with the cast & crew and a real-life featurette with charlie wilson and others. "charlie wilson's war" is a good movie that could have been really great but it's not. but this movie is smart enough to please for those, who enjoyed well written or well acted adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).

mike nichols' film "charlie wilson's war", set in the 1980's, tells the story of how the title character (played by tom hanks) managed to wage a covert war with the russkies by way of aiding the afghan forces. of course, we know how well that turned out in the long run but, thankfully, the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after-effects.the cast is star-studded, with tom hanks and julia roberts being among the most bankable stars in hollywood. as a bonus, you've got the versatile philip seymour hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a not unwarranted oscar nomination. i'm not much of a fan of roberts but hanks is always dependable. nevertheless, i can't quite buy into him as a drug-using womanizer, although the real charlie wilson seems just as eminently likable as hanks. apart from the big three, though, there's not much worth remarking on, even from a recognizable name like amy adams.the story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from aaron sorkin. the verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines. the later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended. on the whole, nichols' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably.this is a film that, like charlie wilson himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable. certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.

consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. the movie starts of as a fast, stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone, in an almost oliver stone kind of way. it's of course also a very serious subject but i would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in.for a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie, the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time. the movie because of this feels like it isn't telling the whole story. of course the following up of the events after the soviet occupation of afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesn't go deeper into it and it doesn't explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to just glorify charlie wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified, even though the story still gets told (needlessly) complex at times.yes, the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. the movie should had been for instance more like "wag the dog", that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues.because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling, the acting performances are also mixed. when tom hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent. but this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive/shocking moments of the movie. philip seymour hoffman is always excellent though, as he is in any movie that he plays in. he also received an oscar nomination for his role in this movie. most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie, just to be in the movie. this goes mostly for julia roberts, whose character i found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. she made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie.it's not that the movie is a bad watch, it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve.7/10

charlie wilson's war, based on a true story, tells the tale of a texas congressman and a cia agent working to secure funding for covert support of the mujaheddin in 1980s afghanistan following the ussr invasion of the country. this conflict played a major role in the final years of the cold war between the us and the ussr.in terms of film making, charlie wilson's war is a definite winner. it well-written, well-acted, and well-shot. while most of the attention has gone to tom hanks for yet another fine performance, i was even more impressed with philip seymour hoffman's turn as cia operative gust avrakotos. scenes of soviet attacks on under-armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart. the film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that congressman wilson must go through to secure the desired funding.there are, however, two complaints i have about the film. the first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line. the second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. the film makes the mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while they did suffer large civilian casualties, the mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of afghanistan. this government, ignored entirely in the film, not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion, later calling on the soviet union for support in their effort. the film also ignores that the us was aiding the mujaheddin prior to the soviet deployment in afghanistan. the film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions -- consequences we are still feeling today -- but it seems as if screenwriter aaron sorkin and director mike nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (not having read the book, i do not know if george crile made the same compromise.) those complaints notwithstanding, i did enjoy watching charlie wilson's war and do recommend it. i would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation, as stephen gaghan did in syriana, but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of charlie wilson's war than with the ambiguities present in syriana.

here is a movie that almost gets it all right, with good performances from everyone, and three strong leading performances from hanks, seymour hoffman, and a fine turn up from julia roberts that had me spell bound from the first few seconds, these are performances that lift the production to the stars, and keep it there for the duration. apart from one or two very minor factual problems with the script, the only thing that lets this movie down, is the technical direction, there are far too many bad cuts (fudged continuity)and a number of camera "cheats" that simply do not work. this is surprising for a movie of this stature, and is a little annoying to watch, but it does not destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted film.

nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie. more often than not, the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult. while there are exceptions to this rule, it's hard to justify owning a dvd of krull, regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be. but stay sharp gen x/y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane, might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting.one surprise film worth another look is joel schumacher's flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights keifer sutherland, kevin bacon, julia roberts and billy baldwin. you would think that a stew comprised of this cast, the flamboyant flair of schumacher and the über slick eye of cinematographer jan de bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy, but calories aside... flatliners ain't half bad. even though it's production design is inexplicably over-the-top and the photography is achingly over- stylized (replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam), flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. if there's an explanation why flatliners was forgotten, it might be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller: jacob's ladder.had flatliners been released a year or two after jacob's ladder, it's likely schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down, commercialized rip-off of adrian lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. but with these films being released in the same year, flatliners enjoyed a different fate, tripling jl's take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise. the passage of time hasn't been as kind to flatliners, it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80's brat pack dreck, while jl has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. fates aside, jl is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame, whereas flatliners falls victim to over- simplification and hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. comparisons between the two movies is unfair, and ultimately overlooks flatliners ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best. released at the end of a decade of shallow excess, flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness, it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at (or at least near) the top of its particular heap of dreck. for intents and purposes, it's an entertaining walk down memory lane.

i just watch this move recently on encore channel. what a great film, a great cast as well. flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable. the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement. therefore nelson played by kiefer sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life. then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life. then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy steckle played by olliver platt. then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god. david labraccio played by kevin bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about god. it's amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon, oliver platt, william baldwin and kiefer sutherland at such a prime time of their careers. one can ask how come we don't have such great movie produced anymore. this is one of the best productions from joel schumacher. i really enjoy this movie.

although flatliners is 15 years old, tonight was my first time ever seeing it. i had heard about the movie flatliners, but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period. well, i caught it on one of the premium channels and i must say that it was very good.this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death. they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him/her back to life. besides the all-star cast, this movie had some serious bite to it. just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough, but i really thought the writer & director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view. this was no generic attempt to thrill, frighten, and make one's mind race... this was the real deal.instead of making it an empty, superficial, star-studded thriller, this movie had substance. a nail-biter, white knuckle, edge-of-the-seat, hard nose thriller. i give it an 8/10.

this movie is great from start to finish about a group of med students that get together and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then revive themselves. they then research what happens from the "near death" experiences. as each one goes through the experience, they become haunted by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality. this ranges from dead kids with hockey sticks to dead fathers that seem to be upstairs.the cast is first rate and oliver platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. i am not a big keifer sutherland fan but even he does an excellent job. this is a movie that i can watch over and over!

a film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. we are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. religion is declared dead. yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. what's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. that was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. today things are changing, especially when the president of the united states himself, barack obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. the film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. post modernism had not reached hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the white house. so some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. it reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. one has to do with a drug addicted father of a vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. it is so naïve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. the film though is interesting but in something quite different. the setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, quite in the style of "death in venice" or greenaway, or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is. of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university versailles saint quentin en yvelines, cegid

nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife. so they do and soon enough all of the medical students want to know if there is life after death. the afterlife isn't about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel but something more sinister.past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone. it has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder somewhat about what happens when you die. it's a good movie to see when it's raining and you're feeling down. it's also a little weird.see it with a haunted past.

can't get much eerier than flatliners. this deep, dark film had my heart pumping throughout. the lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death defying experience, literally. keifer is in top form as he is today in 24. he's a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role you won't forget for years to come. and what can you say for the rest of the cast? an all-star lineup, julia is hotter than ever, will, oliver, and kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats. it's a refreshing sight to see a true thriller, with top notch professional actors. you won't regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender. -jl

there's a spartan, unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us how we're meant to be feeling; in 'blue', everything was overtly sad (sure, powerful as hell, but still); in 'white', it was delightful whimsy. but there are no such emotional clues, or cues for that matter, in this one. it's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment. i think that's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three, but finally, the most transcendent and redemptive. never has remorseless, unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful.

valentine "dogkiller" dussaut and joe "the judge" kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of geneva! thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers, polish fugitives, peeping toms, philandering girlfriends, renegade dogs, and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables. don't be fooled by the deceptive miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious, art house flick. this movie is 100% action!

i use imdb very much. mainly reading comments of other people about movies i´ve or not seen. i´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life, and the way i look a movie. i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94, when i saw it in the theatre for the first time.i feel kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. and i think this is his best one. it was his last one. i was very sad the day i knew he has died, because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him.red is just the best kieslowski + incredibile performance by trintignant & jacob + cinematography by sobocinski. if you haven´t seen it look for it!!! if you have, just come back to it!!red: just a masterpiece. please, forgive my poor english!, reader

people talk about how horrible the script was, and how horrible the animation was, but rainbow brite and the star stealer really is a japanese anime aimed towards children. if you look at the anime today it's done in the same style, and it's immensely popular. i don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults. just as i don't think it was ever intended to be serious. the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love. rainbow brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. she's smart. she's funny. she cares about the enviorment. she cares about her friends. this movie can teach so much to young kids. my little brothers even liked this movie. i have to say this movie taught me a lot when i was a kid. when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it. it's a great kids movie. so what if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough at it.

rainbow brite and the star stealer, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. i felt all warm and tingly when rainbow brite (voice of bettina) and krys (voice of david mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of rhonad aldrich). if you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. to me, she deserved to have rainbow brite and krys seek revenge on him. however, i liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. in addition, i thought that lurky (voiec of pat fraley) and murky (voiec of peter cullen) were diabolical. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and disney has scored a big hit. in conclusion, i highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasn't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the tv series. i guarantee you you'll enjoy it.

valentine, a model in france is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in england, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. one night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named rita. the dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. she becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games. one conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though, the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife, which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them. as we find out more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then continues his story, and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate. little does valentine know how her life, this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together. her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate, a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner, allowing valentine to be the saviour of the young judge, who is traveling the same path as her dear friend, to prevent him from having such a grim future, filled with loneliness and solitude. it seems the old man's dream will come true after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days.an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time! kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. he is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen. and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. usually signified with a subtle pause, or late focus in a scene, see if you can spot some. i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her tv, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years. i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! i recommend this for everyone who loves film, movies, anything...a work of art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.

and there are not many in cinema history. "rouge" seems to be a bit of a hope. hope in mankind and in life. but to say only that may be naive. kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. but what to say about this master of the camera? you can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces. kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors. ms. jacob and mr. tringtignant are perfect it's not only this movie but the downbeat "thou shall not kill" and "a story about love" that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist's point of view. pity american public -the average one- could not see these films. at least they are not in the maltin's dictionary. and even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas

it is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, blue, white, and red, and consider them together as one complete work. it is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. they are each well worth seeing independently, but i believe they are best seen as one work. collectively, i would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, i place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.the color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad, the profiled model of which is the central of the movie's three main characters. the other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad, posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection. this ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie, yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons i have called red a `mind-bending' film. this is the third of kieslowski's three colors trilogy, based on the blue-white-red of the french flag and the three parts of its motto, `liberty, equality, fraternity.' the films stay primarily focused on these themes, keeping with the basic levels of one, two, or three main characters, yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (liberty, blue) to relational (equality, white) to social (fraternity, red). red is my favorite of these films, and i give it a 9. it stands by itself as a great film, but one should see blue and white first for the fullest effect.

the final part of kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. in red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. however, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', kieslowski's red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. in red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by. you sense red is really an allegory, a reenactment of prospero's omnipresent gestures in the tempest, yet it is more than its story appears. red demands countless viewings, and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.although red stands alone as a masterwork from kieslowski, it's best viewed as part of the trilogy. elements of blue and white are referenced in red, which knowing viewers will enjoy.

this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. there's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. valentine (irene jacob) lives in geneva, where she works as a model. though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. one night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner, a retired jugde (jean-louis trintignant), who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls. disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again. two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other. the story itself is too complex to be told completely, there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship.the actors are wonderful, irene jacob and jean-louis trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship. the topics are of an endless validity, fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in the respect for the right of privacy. alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more, which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994.red is one of the strongest colours that exists, representing inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. used here as another protagonist, it brings a unmatched depth to the movie. a masterpiece!

see three colors: blue and three colors: white. they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors: red. red is a fantastic film. it can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. but, watch it again. once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each viewing. with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind. with each additional viewing, you find yourself discovering that it is, in fact, a work of genius. red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the french flag. the story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect. the facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer. if you are used to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass films, you may find red a bit slow. you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom... and yawning, wonder what all the excitement is about. this is not a mindless, vicarious experience. everything is not explained to you. you must think as you watch. you must see... not simply look. wonderful movie... one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer.

this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. he intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. he died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, destiny decided that this was indeed his last. and what a film!'rouge' the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film. set in geneva, one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge, and durenmatt immediately comes to mind. but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life. several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final, which only a great artist could have staged.little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times. yes, the film starts slowly, and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers. they deserve it. the film gets quality as it advances, and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters. cinema quality is very original, the image being a 'study in red', as the title shows. acting is fabulous, with irene jacob and jean-louis trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age. a great film. seeing it again probably adds, and i am happy to have it recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.

i feel at a loss, so brilliant is this film. kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and while an excellent filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "red" is his paradigm. this film is a metafictional study of the artist's judgement in the creation of his fictional world; of how an artist can attempt to remake life -- even his own -- thru his art, even as he cannot escape the knowledge that, no matter how he involves himself in his story, it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world, still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake. and magically, all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story, this pre-judged destiny. if i had to choose, i might nominate this the greatest film ever made.

it's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors: red without letting people in on some of the ideas that krysztoff kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. the more i see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more i get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion. in blue, juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. in white, an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will, against the odds, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle. and now, in red, all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people's lives.this young girl is appropriately named: valentine (a luminous irene jacob), who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway. not that she is without some baggage: she has a boyfriend, unseen, who also demands to know what she is doing at all times, she has a brother who troubles her, and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard. she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (jean louis trintingnant), he does not want her. "i want nothing," he coldly says, and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent, free-floating freedom, conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people. this male version of juliette binoche's character at first shocks valentine -- she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror, but a chance event has her back at his place, and here is when he begins revealing who he is, and his great loss.at the same time kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story: the story of a young man, auguste (jean pierre lorit), about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine -- but they keep missing each other. chance is the word. like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits, elements of chance pepper her life and auguste's. he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather. one of them happens to be the old judge. he knows more about her than auguste does, and he's never met her. like god, or prospero, he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression "we meet again." it's this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent, because time is, in reality, a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it. there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames, so many things would be different.such is the case with valentine and the old judge. i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond: she is that woman whom he did not meet -- by chance or not -- and is, whether he knows it or not, trying to make amends, hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast. but it doesn't end there. one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container. where julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyhow), and karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking, "someone is worse off than i am," valentine is the one who helps her. frailty in need can happen anywhere, and kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character.now, red is so much more than a story. valentine, the old judge, auguste, even rita the dog: these aren't characters confined by storytelling. an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed-down ending. red is so devoid of a linear, defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place.adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal. this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films: in blue, julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it's become clear she's emotionally dead. in white, dominique has karol listen to her moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in red) as she has sex with a man while the billboard of brigite bardot's contempt looks on. in red, the old judge's tale of love and betrayal gets re-enacted. and all this time, valentine's billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that rita, the dog valentine's car struck, bears seven pups, life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love. why do i say six? you'll have to watch the movie and wonder.

brilliant aussie movie... a little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line, as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more so in particular, the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. when i saw the movie, somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet matthew newton after the screening... such a nice gentleman (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! brillian casting as well with sam neill and others! a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry

i saw this film purely by chance. it was shown very late, or more correctly very early one morning on television. i had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on.it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere (it certainly isn't as good as educating rita, despite a couple of additional twists) and has a very predictable ending.despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole.i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen him in many different films including: dead calm; the piano; sirens; children of the revolution; event horizon; bicentennial man and the ubiquitous jurassic park. he was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut.some of the acting was, in my opinion, dreadful rose byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed (all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example).however, two actors (who i hadn't, or don't remember, seen before) impressed me a lot sinéad cusackn as frances (frank) kennedy, and especially matthew newton as her son david. he, in particular, was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him.

a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent. director mark lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing. definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival. australian film veteran, sam neill was, as always, fabulous in the role of frank's uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying, " you know, bert newton, matt's dad!" get out and see this movie!!!

the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around, or that they are all the same.well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other australian films. it is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. the script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. but more important this is a great film. i don't want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible. suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences. take your girlfriend, take your mum, take your friends - for a great evening out.10/10!!!!

i can't see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 5.7 from imdb voters. it's a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other catastrophes, the sugar factory, occasional coarse language, russian doll, sample people, the secret life of us, la spagnola, strange planet, fresh air, dust off the wings, doing time for patsy cline, etc..., as a 19-year-old uni student (newton, in perhaps his best role yet, on par with changi at least) with a bored, over-religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him - and before you go thinking another goofy movie, it's not, there's some real substance here. sure, it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular (but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo-jumbo aren't they?), and maybe the study of sinead cusack's character is a little muddled at times, but the film is bright, funny, and has some important messages. the principle cast is terrific: cusack and newton are wonderful, and rose byrne (see her also in the goddess of 1967) is so underrated it's not funny. she's a beautiful, fresh, confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives. i gave my mother frank 8/10.

my mother frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged catholic woman (frank, short for francis, played by sinead cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (matthew newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (rose byrne). meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor (sam neill).matthew newton is utterly disarming as david; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight. he generates valuable goodwill, steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward, broad comedy moments. not long after the half-way point, first-time writer-director mark lamprell expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine.the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (lynette curran, sacha horler, nicholas bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual sam neill) are excellent. while it meanders a little towards the end, my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd-pleaser.

the japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world,and this is one of the strongest examples.with a running time at about an hour,it contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth(even those who are hunting this type of movies).three men and a woman are making a porn film.after some normally shots(which are pixelated),the girl is tied up,and the madmen cut her food,arm and tong.after that,they make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestines.he is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off.the special effects are good for an obviously low budget production(only the tong cut scene looks fake),and we can't talk about acting,direction or screenplay.after hearing a lot about this film,i was very happy when i finally found it.the first part is pretty boring,but the second one totally f***k up my mind,the torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing i have ever seen.the gore hounds will be satisfied by "tumbling doll of flesh",but an unknowing viewer shouldn't even read the synopsis.

tumbling doll of flesh (aka niku daruma and psycho: the snuff reels) this was on my want list for quite a while, and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back. it's never been on dvd, and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd-r, which i'm quite satisfied with. the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. the porn is definitely real, with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat, and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest. this is after both legs have been severed, her arm, and a few other niceities. this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot, in fact, they are not even close to the realism, although cheap gore effects, shown in this movie. this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen, if not the best. now i must warn you, that if you are not into this stuff, you should stay far far away. this movie is very strong, and with the real sex, it is in a very sick way, erotic to an extent. and i mean, in a very sick way. but wherever you come down on this subject material, this movie brings the goods home, and i would definitely recommend you seek it out. after reading about the movie, i was expecting something very strong, but it exceeded that by a bunch.

first of all , you should watch this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles , pornography , kinky sex and utter , horrifying and truly shocking depravity . i mentioned kinky sex , but to call sex in the second half of the movie " kinky " would be a great understatement . it's more like a punch in the face if you aren't prepared for this sort of sickness . that being said , i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo - snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese .the plot seems to be fairly basic , almost nonexistent : a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie . don't expect much in first 30 - 40 minutes . there is some dialog - if you don't speak japanese it's not going to mean much to you - that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew & performer , then there is some porn ( straight sex ) , and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break . and then ... it starts to happen .it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene - this time tied with the rope . the abuse begins : whipping , slapping , hot wax ... in the end , girl breaks down and cries . they untie her .then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except for the girl . she is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave . she walks to the door , sits on the floor to put her shoes on ... and that's when hell breaks loose .she is hit in the head with the baseball bat , her wound is treated , she is tied to the bed . what ensues can be briefly described ( i'm not going to spoil everything for you ) as rape during dismemberment . think of " flower of flesh and blood " , mix it with porn and you will get the idea .it goes on for about 20 minutes or so . sfx are very good , makeup too . everything is shown , with no mercy for the viewer . you have been warned .i thought " visitor q " was a very sick movie . after watching " niku daruma " it looked like a fairytale to me .this movie is so sick , so depraved , so twisted , so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale . too bad it's released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available . but the movie still works without them . so , if you are into ultra sickness , extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre , check this out . i hope you won't have nightmares .8/10 .

if you were enjoyed by watching "guinea pig" - then you'll like this movie to! "psycho: the snuff reels" is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. actually the effects are not so realistic like in "guinea pig", but its still pretty gory."psycho: the snuff reels" contains 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. first 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. after that you'll see fetish sex scenes. and last one is a torture scene. the guys torture and rape girl - they cut off her legs, hand, tongue... in the end guy rapes girl in her stomach (!) and after that other guy beat him and cut off his balls. sounds pretty sick, isn't it?:) like i said - it's pseudo snuff movie. "psycho: the snuff reels" is pretty rare japanese movie and as i know it's really hard to find it. but if you are crazy about that sort of films i believe that you can find it!

"tumbling doll of flesh" by tamakichi anaru is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse,torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.typically twisted japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.there is no plot to speak of,just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.the special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.the tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines."psycho:the snuff reels" actually reminds me "guinea pig:flowers of flesh and blood",but it's not as memorable.so if you're a fan of ultra-depraved japanese sickies like "all women are whores" or "raping my virgin slave" give this one a look.8 out of 10.

the word ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to cricket) in india. the use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.ghilli is one of the best movies for vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. the movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. the movie is set in madurai and chennai and its story core is simple. a rich landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in his town, and his unquestionable power and authority, prevents the girl from seeking a justice. the hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens.a very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new, the director and the actors receive praise for the full-paced action.

if u haven't seen vijay in "ghillli", "gilly" or "ghillie". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. there are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls velu "maacha". the one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. his teeth are brilliant as well. vijay rocks. trisha cries every 5 seconds. it is very deep. watch it, you won't regret it. there are some great laughs in this one. if you don't speak tamil, learn it. then you will get all the inside jokes. it is one for the whole family, except maybe the violent bits should be skipped. i've seen this movie around eleven times .... and counting.wow!

ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... as i had not seen the telegu movie so i could enjoy this movie even more.the story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. vijay who had come to play a kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. the rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies. the movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end. vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player. trisha,ashish vidyarthi,the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently. a special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie prakashraj.the villain's character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well. surprisingly, for the first time, i felt sympathy for the villain in the end. the dialogue "hi chellam" has really caught on with the masses. the music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage all over..dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world.

brilliant screenplay..the screenplay is very tight ..that u will be gelled in seat..this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no-story needed..story is very simple that u can write in one line. but screenplay was amazing..brilliant performance by vijay and prakashraj..though plot is similar to okkadu.. director adapted only the plot. tamil version is much fast paced than telugu.movie travels straight without any chance of deviation, though u can understand each and every characters back-drop.keep going

ghillie a remake of the telugu "okkadu' is thankfully a clarified version of the original. it packs the same punch and dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. a flagging vijay's career with the entry of the likes of surya and vikram on the fray, got the much needed uplift with this movie. this might well prove to be the best movie vijay has ever been on, considering the choices he has been making since then. the hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike.the tightly snug script, which runs at, a neck-break speed revolves around velu, a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of kabaddi( a popular game among boys in india). the events following the chance encounter with muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie. vijay fits as a 't' into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door.trisha has more than a stereotyped tamil heroine mantle to play. the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. with limited dialog's, trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress. trisha became my personal favorite after this movie.the movie ends on predictable lines, although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including trisha's change in decision to leave the country. prakash raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for vijay's role. his almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero's armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing.overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing. i give it a clear 8 out of 10.

i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; it's not like american pie or something. i know not why people are offended by the universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.this is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), great acting, and a cheesy ending.(minor spoiler) the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy (muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf (giamatti) comes along. so he gets his best friend kaylee (bynes) and they go and drive the wolf crazy.frankie muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not as jason shepherd. he handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well, and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness.amanda bynes. what more can i say? the girl's got the gift. she's funny, talented, versatile, and very, very attractive. (i'm only 6 months older than her. i need to get to california sometime soon.) in fact, the 'best-friend' part was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the makers saw amanda's interest. which works out pretty well, since the part would've been pretty dull without the blessing of bynes's abilities.paul giamatti is a very talented man. while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical, giamatti made him-not just a jerk, mind you, but a likeable jerk, a jerk that livens up the screen, rather than intentionally dimming it. and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf undergoes as well.all in all, great movie. loved seeing jaleel white able to mock himself. loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director, shawn levy, another is bynes's former co-star kenan thompson) loved seeing amanda in those outfits........ get the dvd if you can. it's got all kinds of great extra stuff, and the lovely ms. bynes is your guide through the menus. :)

who said it had to be believable? do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. you'll enjoy the experience much more. you'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. i appreciated not having to be concerned about "questionable elements" in a children's film for once. that, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film. enough good humor to keep adults interested. very good film.

fun movie! great for the kids - they found it very entertaining. somewhat predictable, but there are a few surprises. great movie to watch if you're looking for something just to entertain (don't expect to be seeing a classic!)

with all of the "r" movies out today, it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see. my kids loved it. it was good clean fun. i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies.

i wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. frankie muniz of "malcom in the middle" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good. yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways. grade: b-

spoiler alert!!!! this was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.he wrote this, i swear.with malcolm in the middle's frankie muniz, and nickelodeon's amanda bynes, they get to go to show business. they team up on the actor paul giamatti. he stole jason shepherd's essay on big fat liar, and makes it in to a movie. jason (frankie muniz) and kaylee (amanda bynes) have to go to l.a. to get it back. jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay. so every time they see each other jason asks wolf (paul giamatti) to give jason's dad a call because he wants his essay back!!!! wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it. at the end the family and kaylee see the movie, made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd.

after seeing big fat liar, i think jason learned a lot more. when he told the truth about marty stealing his story, it was like the boy who cried wolf. people heard him, but they didn't believe him. nobody did anything to help him. besides, not only marty's movies stink, so does his advice. the truth is not overrated. i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is. everyone found out that he stole from that boy, including his parents. not only he stole from that boy and lied about it, he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own, which is plagiarism. doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? another reason why he got fired. he is not trustworthy. he's a liar, a cheat, a thief, a crook, and a plagiarist. you got that marty? you're a plagiarist. plus, you got everything that you deserved.

big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. but as i was watching it, i thought about something. some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. so really, the film is kind of a big fat lie. there is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this. here are all of the unbelievable stuff.1. when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball, and acts like he is the father. jason(frankie munez) couldn't have gotten away with that. well, luckily for us, he didn't. so it didn't stick with it, the outrageous.2.even if the grandmother was blind, she still could've figured out that that wasn't her granddaughter. 3.they couldn't have gotten on the plane, flown to l.a., acted like they were coat salesmen, sneak into the studio, and then, and then... well, some of the film is a little unbelievable. but it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. trust me, i do it all the time.big fat liar, though unbelievable at times, is fun. it's also very funny. but let me just say one thing before i continue this review. if paul giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. it would be horrible. big fat liar is also pretty funny, though corny at times. i give it a thumbs up.big fat liar:***/****

big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages, even adults. i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under. the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too! frankie muniz is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious! overall, a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time.

big fat liar, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. when jason (frankie muniz - "malcolm in the middle") and kaylee (amanda bynes - "all that") played those tricks on marty (paul giamatti - doctor dolittle), i really smiled and felt good. that's what i liked most about this movie. as a matter of fact, everything that happened after jason's essay erroneously ended up in marty's hands was hilarious. i especially loved jaleel white's cameo. when i first saw him, i couldn't be certain, but, when i asked my mother if it was him, she said, "of course!" before i wrap this up, i'd like to say, "like i said earlier, there is a moral to this story, and that moral is, always tell the truth." now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of frankie muniz, amanda bynes, or paul giamatti, i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it.

spoiler warningwe've all heard the "boy who cried wolf" legend. but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. well it might be something like big fat liar. fourteen-year-old jason sheperd ( frankie muniz from "malcolm in the middle" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. one day he is pressured to write an english essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker marty wolf ( paul giamatti ) who plans to turn jason's story into a hollywood blockbuster. no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school. however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l.a. with his friend kaylee ( amanda bynes ). when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story, jason plans to make wolf's life a living hell. b.f.l. is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time. i wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough ( i like the pool-dye the best ). i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren't for paul giamatti. he is simply hilarious in this. if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out. you might just enjoy it.

i love this movie. yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called "big fat liar". even though this kid runs away to hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. i don't think it was just one big ad for universal studios, because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is. it has good music and fun characters. this family/comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike. it has humour, excitement, and real life difficulties like lying.in the end, "big fat liar" sends out a moral: don't expect lying to be easy.

this isn't a life-changing movie; it's not an epic, or anything like that. but it's entertaining, and it's fun. it's a film that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are precious few kid-suitable films that don't have a love story in them! it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects, like lots of films these days are. it's got some fairly good acting in, and all the music that's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content. the acting is quite good too, the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny. i'd recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)

this is one of the funniest movies i've ever saw. a 14-year old boy jason shepherd wrote an english paper called "big fat liar". when his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. when he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from hollywood, marty wolf. when he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! so marty wolf took it and he turned jason's english paper into a movie! when jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and marty took it, his parents and his english teacher didn't believe him! so jason and his friend kaylee had to fly to los angeles to go to hollywood to make marty admit he stole his story to jason's parents. when jason told marty to call his dad that marty stole that paper, marty tricked him and burned his paper! jason got so angry that marty burned that paper so marty called security to get jason out of his site! jason and kaylee realized marty isn't going to admit the truth. in order to take marty down in phase 2: the takedown, jason and kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when marty jumps in, his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! then they put permanent orange dye in marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! finally, they put lots of glue on marty's earpiece to make him call jason's father and when marty uses it, it sticks to his ear! it was funny when marty's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! after that, they tricked marty by telling monty, who is marty's assistant, that duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. when marty went in to see duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! when marty was in the house, jason and kaylee switched the controls of his car. when marty drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. he's stupid enough to fall for it. when marty hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! it was so funny. so marty starts to call jason's dad and tricked him again! he was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! after the security got jason and kaylee out of marty's site, they suggested them to go home. monty was going to be on jason and kaylee's side cause she knew that marty was a liar and a jerk so she told rocco, who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to l.a. when monty came to the kids, she's going to help the kids move into phase 4: the payback. jason splits the crew into 3 teams for phase 4. one team will distract and trick marty until jason's parents get to the set. marty first rode with frank jackson, but his car broke down so he rode with jaleel, but he took him into the desert and leave him there. when marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. after that, one of the blades are jammed so marty and the pilot got off the helicopter. after that, he was on the way to the set and when jason saw him, marty stopped and saw what jason has: his monkey! so marty went after jason and kaylee and when they saw lester, he released the water and when the water came, it pushed marty away. marty was still after the kids and when kaylee went the other way, jason led marty to the top of the apartment building. at the top, jason was challenging marty by making him admit the truth and marty will never ever tell the truth. when the crew caught marty in surprise, all the people including jason's parents who were at the set knew what marty did. marty was going to kill jason but the only way for jason to escape is jump down from the top! after that, his parents believed him that marty took his story. when the people who were on the set left, this is the end of marty. at the end, jason's story, big fat liar was a movie. i cant get enough of it.

i could watch this movie all day! i love it. probably my all time favorite movies. but, by the way, "badger1970" there are a few parts with bad language, not too bad, but it's not exactly g rated. great movie!!!!! i recommend it to everybody. any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so i am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. okay... still typing... this is getting annoying. ugh. i still have four more to go. anyway, watch this movie! even if you have already seen it. i don't care! has it been 10 lines yet? nope. only 2 more lines left. i don't even know why it wants me to do this. i think i am done. wait a minute, i'm not done, sorry, people. i know it's torture listening to me. well, i suppose that you don't have to read this comment... but you should, because i wrote it. i am probably done now. finally, bye.

much better than expected. good family flick - catch it on reruns. the whole is more than the sum of its parts. paul giamatti chews up the scenery - he has way more talent then the role deserves. a treat to watch inspector uhl from "the illusionist" go over the top. the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches. the cameos were particular fun for the parents - nice to see lee majors and urkel (umm, jaleel) again. it's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film , but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting. i normally can't stand frankie muniz but he is just fine here. hats off to the casting director - if only for hiring giamatti!

i can't understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? it really is great, very funny. i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! the story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. one day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. but he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to summer school. yep, he wrote it in 2:45. "big fat liar", i think it was a story of himself. on the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer, and he gave him a ride. but the kid forgot the story in the limo. he told his parents and the teacher, but of course, they did not believe him. and the movie producer, he took the kid's story as his new movie, "big fat liar". when the kid saw the trailer of the movie, he told his parents he had written it, but they didn't believe. so, he and his friend had to go to l.a to prove one thing: the truth is never overrated enjoy this great movie, you won't be disappointed. don't trust the 5.2/10 rate, it should be 9/10! believe me! p/s: so sorry, my english isn't good enough to make a better comment!

i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. he would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. we've had the dvd for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that i don't mind having to hear it in the background (and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts). simple moral message, lots of decent action and slapstick, "bad" grownups acting goofy to take the edge off, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.

changi has a delightfully fresh script, acted superbly by both young and old actors alike. john doyle has done an excellent job bringing humour to a tragic true story, keeping a sometimes sad story fun and engrossing, particularly to those of us not familiar with the events of south east asia during ww2.john doyle's parallel story line successfully bridges the gap between past and present, allowing the audience insight into the long-term effect war had on the prisoners and their family's lives as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which nicely rounds out the tales, both individual and collective. doyle deserves praise for this effort. we have in the past been delighted by his abundant and quick-witted humour as evidenced in his long running collaboration with greg pickhaver as `roy & h.g.'as the series is approaching half way, we are looking forward to how the story develops with anticipation.

this would have to be by far the greatest series i have ever seen. i vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available. this is a timeless play written by a fantastic australian that people of all ages could relate to, whether they are australian or not, however for those of us that are australian it truly brings across the typical australian icon. a must see 10/10

somehow, changi lost out in the afi awards to my brother jack. the latter, a high-quality adaptation of george johnston's immortal novel, was outstanding - but, in my opinion, not as good as changi. i have heard that many critics dismissed changi as being irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. who and where are these critics? changi is outstanding. more than that. brilliant. it's not supposed to be a documentary - certainly i can forgive the actual changi survivors (or indeed any survivors of a pow camp) for being disappointed with the production - but to the rest of us, changi represents the remarkable power of mateship in times of extreme adversity. it contains a part of the australian culture that appears to be diminishing as times become easier and less challenging, but which we should never forget: australians were respected worldwide after gallipoli and ww2 for their comradery and sense of humour. rating: 96/100. see also: gallipoli; paradise road; the last bullet; the sugar factory.

as soon as i saw the ad for "changi" on the history channel, i knew i'd love it. it captured the anzac spirit fantastically - you would die if you didn't have mates around you. the characters of "changi" were strong and each brought something different into the story, and the japanese soldiers weren't criticised, but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the australians were doing. direction, screenplay, acting and setting were all done wonderfully, with a clear easy-to-follow plot. humour was the soldiers' key to survival, and it was great to see a mini-series about war actually have some sort of humour in it, which is usually difficult to do without offending people. from what i've read about soldiers in changi pow camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those australian, british, new zealand, american and dutch men spent there. i would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.

i've heard a few comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that changi is not historically accurate, and that it is disappointing. perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff, and much worse. but for the rest of us, who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii, changi is a remarkable introduction. but changi isn't a war documentary - if it had have been, then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount. it is a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though based loosely on actual events i've heard and read about) - and at the centre of the story is the ideal of mateship. this group of young australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years, became mates through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war. it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world, with its music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has surrendered in europe, the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners - in order to defeat a people, one must defeat their culture - and to do this, one must understand it. all in all, australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries, and is an unrivalled world leader in this regard: vyeing for the afi award with changi is my brother jack, the adaptation of george johnston's novel, and also a worthy winner. miniseries in recent years include day of the roses (the story of the investigation into the glanville train crash), kings in grass castles (the adaptation of mary durack's historical account of her pioneering ancestors), kangaroo palace (about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart), and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of bryce courtenay's powerful novel, the potato factory. less recently: nancy cato's sweeping saga of life on the murray - all the rivers run; cusack & james' brilliant novel about postwar life in sydney - come in spinner; colleen mccullough's outstanding pioneering saga - the thorn birds; the river kings; ruth park's novel the harp in the south; bodyline; eureka stockade; anzacs; etc..., etc... (of course, there have been some not-so-good productions - for instance, moby dick, do or die, on the beach, thorn birds: the missing years; etc...) generally, though, if an australian miniseries comes your way, make sure you see it - and this goes double for changi, a superbly directed masterpiece. rating: 9/10.

this has got to be one of australia's best productions. i completely disagree with the comments made by 'raminour101'.this series shows the depth of australian mateship and the lengths they went to to help each other out. episode five 'eddies birthday' is a great example of this and it really captures the australian spirit.the music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with, their longing for home and their loved ones. the numerous amusing renditions of the road to gundagai captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home, and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while.as for the comment about it being racist towards japanese people, the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened. the japanese did treat the australians very poorly in changi and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed. the comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false. these six stories that are told in the series are composed from real p.o.w experiences.the actors were superb; the best being in my opinion, matthew newton. his performance as david in the first episode was gut wrenching. from being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. we see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of the secret nine.stephen curry also deserves a mention. his performance in 'eddie's birthday' is amazing, going from the larrikin of the group, to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. the displays of mateship in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be australian.i study wwii at university level and have found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful, as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an australian soldier.well done to john doyle for capturing the spirit of changi.

here we have a miniseries, which revels in in its flaws, and doesn't make us cringe because of them...it is excellent story-telling, which fuses black comedy, mateship (in a positive way), the pathetic waste of war, without the sheer unadulterated manipulation of a con-job like life is beautiful...it is an entertainment, not the meaning of life...and showcases the talents of actors both young and old...give it a go and tell us what you think...

this movie was fun! especially if your between 8 and 15. frankie muniz and amanda bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it. paul giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get'. my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. parents: no really bad words or any sex to worry about. recommend it for the 'right' crowd. ap

having had a great grandfather be captured and sent to changi during world war two i was hesitant to watch this when it was first screened on tv. my great grandfather kept a diary whilst he was in captivity and when he died over there his mates bought it back and i have been lucky enough to read it and feel i have at least some idea of what changi was really like, first hand.this is a fantastic recount of what happened to those poor blokes who were sent to changi prison and shows what hardship and cruelty they witnessed in order to protect their country. it is a terrific story of mateship, commitment and aussie spirit, that never going to give up attitude. it is worth watching if you like australian history or anything to do with world war two.i enjoyed this mini very much and give it 10 out of 10.

my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through.my own father spent some time in changi before going onto the thailand-burma railway in "f" force. much as been said about the treatment the pow's received, i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs.no show could truly convey what the pow's went through, but this comes closer than most.as the ex pow's say, "if you didn't have mates you didn't survive." this show succeeds in getting this message across.

venice, in 1596.jews are separated from the good christians.bassanio, a young but poor venetian loves the fair portia, who is a wealthy heiress.so he approaches his friend, a merchant called antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to belmont and propose portia.all of antonio's ships and merchandise are busy at sea, so he turns to the moneylender shylock, the one of jewish faith.shylock does not like antonio, for he spat on his face.he offers antonio a three-month loan at no interest, but if he will not pay the money in that time, he will own a pound of his flesh.also, shylock's daughter jessica elopes with the christian lorenzo.the merchant of venice is based on william shakespeare's play that's believed to have written between 1596 and 1598.i read the play last summer and now i've seen the movie, made in 2004 by michael radford.i liked the play, and i don't quite agree with the accusations of it being anti-semitic.the jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even though he's ready to cut a piece of antonio's flesh.there's a lot of depth in his character, which all comes out in his speech where he asks "if you prick us, do we not bleed?" and so forth.there is much more human in shylock's character than in one of antonio's, who spits on the good jew.al pacino is unbeatable as shylock.he gives such a strong performance.jeremy irons is also terrific as antonio.lynn collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of portia.zuleikha robinson does great job as jessica, and charlie cox as lorenzo is also very good.kris marshall plays gratiano, and he does a good job.in the role of nerissa we see heather goldenhersh.mackenzie crook plays launcelot gobbo.as in shakespeare plays usually, also this one contains most brilliant dialogue.the movie paints a fantastic portray of the era.it deals with some great issues, in a shakespearian way.

the merchant of venice 8/10(this review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and so may be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plot.)as a film version of the famous shakespeare play, merchant of venice does what few adaptations have done since polanski's rather gritty macbeth: it takes the spirit of the play and brings it out not just as well as, but better than the play alone could readily achieve. lord of the rings director, peter jackson, has argued that in adapting a book or play there are three options: attempt to replicate the original as perfectly as possible, use the original idea as an inspiration but take full license for cinematic change, or (the one he avowedly preferred) stick to the original as much as is cinematic ally viable but make such changes as are necessary for the film and while remaining faithful to the intention or spirit of the original.in macbeth, polanski used the rain-sodden beaches and realistic rapes and murder to convey what a bloody and horrific period the play was set in, thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill-advised decisions. it differs from (say) branagh's hamlet, which achieved new heights of faithful rendition, but otherwise offered little new. macbeth, on the other hand, maybe enabled audiences fresh to shakespeare to appreciate some of the drama's fullness without extensive study; similarly, more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the unaided stage performance could accomplish. such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points shakespeare wanted to make.radford's adaptation of merchant of venice does just this. it takes crucial moral dilemmas involving religious bigotry or the keeping promises and, with minimal messing of the bard's holy tome, conveys them faithfully within the spirit of the original story.the first of these, religious bigotry, gives meaning to shylock's otherwise outlandish behaviour. we see the jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto, only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap. not being allowed to own property, one of the few ways they can earn a living is by money-lending. this makes them both useful to their christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their vilification. the idea behind (both old and new testament) biblical prohibitions against usury probably stems from not making a profit by helping one's friends. this is extended by the bigoted christians to curse those they spit on (we see shylock not only spit on, but fellow jews thrown into the waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening).the topicality of the film is curious, since the bigotry of right wing christianity (as personified by bush-following americans) has turned full circle, as they are now the main supporters of zionism, and the jewish political leaders bite at their palestinian neighbors much as shylock tries to bite at antonio (once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). the psychology is self-evident - kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious. the circle easily continues as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values and become oppressors.the stringent sleight of hand that the disguised portia uses to save antonio has some merit, both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the venetians of the play so rue and also as a moral pointer. shylock may 'have his pound of flesh' according to his contract, but may not have any blood. an easy analogy could be made as far as warfare and terrorism goes - it is much easier to justify fighting among combatants or attacking ill-doers if soldiers or evil-doers are the only victims - when there is massive collateral damage, as when innocent citizens, including women and children, are killed in their hundreds, the warmongers' arguments (whether those warmongers be israeli, palestinian or us american) carry far less popular support. there has long been much argument whether shakespeare was being anti-semitic in this story. one wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a largely christian audience who had little dealing with jewish people. far from teaching him a greater good, the ending enforces christianity and humiliation upon shylock - a course likely simply to perpetuate pent up resentment. both camps look just as bad - one simply holds more power than the other. the slight amelioration of the judgment simply gives the christian judges a better public image, or as bassanio so acutely (observes when choosing the caskets and solving the riddles to win portia's hand):in religion, what damned error, but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text, hiding the grossness with fair ornament? there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts.of course, the bigotry applies to organised religion (rather than spirituality), especially when organised for political purposes, but one that easily goads ordinary god-fearing people who are not in the habit of splitting hairs. the kindness, mercy ('chesed' in judaism) which is so fundamental to true christianity, is something also practiced to a wonderful degree in judaism as in most creeds. the jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity, ways of practicing both effectively, and ways of making it part of one's being rather than just an outward show. both shylock and antonio are bigoted and use their respective faiths to abuse those of another faith. while shakespeare maybe pointed up the chasm between the goodness prescribed by different faiths and its absence in practice, the film version reduces much of the window for interpretations of anti-semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes.the keeping of promises (the men to their wives) is dealt with less well, as are the comic elements inherent in the cross-dressing sub-plots. bassanio, however strong his love for antonio (are there homosexual elements there?) cannot make sound moral judgements when showing his gratitude to the 'judge', and so breaks his promise (for which portia forgives him, displaying a triumphal character for women, not only as supremely intelligent and witty but also as more truly merciful and considerate of others than her bigoted male counterparts, including her husband.)some of the acting is a bit stilted, and there are too many regional (english) accents, but on the whole merchant of venice delivers a fresh and rewarding reworking of shakespeare. i enjoyed the acting, and also the very beautiful soundtrack by hayley westenra and others, singing ballads penned both by shakespeare and edgar allen poe. all in all, merchant of venice is a not inconsiderable achievement of british (as far as any film can be said to be of a particular nationality these days) cinematic tradition.

michael radford, the director of "the merchant of venice" makes a tremendous job in opening the play, as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this thorny account of a horrible time in history. the luscious production of the shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the venice of the xvi century.this is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by william shakespeare. having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared about what to expect. mr. radford takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone. also, he has used a version of english that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. in fact, the way shylock speaks in the film, doesn't shock at all, being he, a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the venetian authorities and the catholic church.al pacino tremendous portrayal of shylock shows a man that is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, mean, and totally human, all at the same time. mr. pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. his own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be caving in on him. at the end of the film, we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule by everyone.lynn collins, as portia is a happy discovery. having seen her in lighter fare, she not only surprises, but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera. she shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence, who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend, who risked his own well being in trying to help bassanio get portia's hand.jeremy irons plays antonio, the man who seeks shylock for a "bridge loan". after all, he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon. antonio gets much more than he bargained for in agreeing with shylock to the terms of the loan. antonio's best laid plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. mr. irons gives a subtle performance.joseph fiennes, makes a good appearance as bassanio. his good looks and his charm make an impression on portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young venetian as she knows he is the one for her. also, in smaller roles, kris marshall, zuleika robinson, charlie cox, contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience.ultimately, it's mr. radford's triumph because of the vision he gives us of venice and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind.

seriously, where is al pacino's oscar nomination for this one? is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career? pacino here is extraordinary.. he gives a complex, heartbreaking performance as shylock, the jewish money lender.. the movie as a whole was quite great, with beautiful shots of venice to look at and a pitch perfect score to listen to.. the other actors all do a fine job as well, but the real reason to see this is pacino.. i have seen all the nominated oscar performances of 2004, and i must say that pacino was snubbed.. blame it on the anti-semitism associated with the play, the lack of campaigning by the studio, the late release date with no major push, or most likely, all of the above.. in my mind, the best performances of the year belong to jamie foxx in ray, don cheadle in hotel rwanda, and al pacino in the merchant of venice..

william shakespeare's the merchant of venice is about a jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant antonio, the forfeiter of a debt. the jewish moneylender, of course, is shylock and he is given such a towering performance by al pacino that even outstanding actors like jeremy irons, joseph fiennes, and lynne collins fade into the background. the film is set in 16th century venice and director michael radford relies on setting, mood, and realism to tell its story, rejecting lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience.radford slices the play's three-hour length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. in the opening narration, he tells us how jews came to england, were subject to increasing persecution, and eventually expelled from england. they were forbidden to own property, could make profits only by lending money at interest, and were forced to live in a venetian "geto", a forerunner of darker events to come. in the film, the merchant antonio (jeremy irons) spits upon shylock in public, yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover bassanio (joseph fiennes) to properly court portia (lynne collins), a wealthy heiress. though shylock has been insulted by antonio, he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grants him the right to exact a pound of flesh from antonio's heart.the play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well. here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers: bassanio and portia, gratiano, bassanio's friend, and nerissa, and lorenzo, another friend of bassanio, and jessica, shylock's daughter. portia has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes, made of gold, silver, and lead. the prince of morocco chooses the one of gold, the prince of aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed. bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within. radford's adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place. portia's residence at belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of shylock's city with its dank alleyways.when it becomes clear that antonio cannot repay the debt, bassanio returns to venice, leaving portia behind. when he arrives, the loan is in default and shylock is demanding his pound of flesh. even when bassanio, backed by portia's wealth, offers many times the amount in repayment, shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status. the duke, who sits in judgment, will not intervene as portia enters in the guise as a lawyer to defend antonio. it is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolution.the merchant of venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of jews from christian society and their desire for belonging. it has been one of shakespeare's most controversial plays and analysts have debated for a long time whether it is an anti-semitic play or simply a play about anti-semitism that reflects the prevalent view of christian society in elizabethan england. although shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that shakespeare views his flaws as human failings, not jewish ones. the duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the torah.in the monologue, "i am a jew. hath not a jew eyes? if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?", shylock shows a universal humanity, expressing the equality of all men. though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out, we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often over-the-top persona is replaced with a gentler, more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause.. during a toronto international film festival interview last september, radford said about pacino, "when you work with a brilliant actor, you have a great machine. it's a bit like driving a powerful car. you have to dare to do it." he has dared and we are all the beneficiaries.

i saw the merchant of venice in london last week. great acting by al pacino, jeremy irons, joseph finnes and lynn collins. compare to other movies based on shakespeare's play, this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow. bravo to michael radford for directing such top actors. the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in venice it gives the film and authentic flavor. i had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters' anti-semitic behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians. i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations.

it is a risky business to film such a lavish production of "the merchant of venice". it could be a stodgy, wooden, period piece, or it could be laughable for its excesses. this version is neither. while i am not completely sold by al pancino's very restrained shylock, he does give a competent and honorable performance. jeremy iron's antonio, is as always with his tortured-self roles, riveting. some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of boisterous fun, "a boy's own venician adventure story", but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically moved forward through the film.it goes without saying, that the location shots, costumes, and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction.one thing, on which i do not wish to comment on, is the anti-semetic content of the play. the film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the jews as possible while still portraying shylock as the instrument of his own self-destruction. it is a sad comment that four centuries later, the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film fest.this is a beautiful film, and i look forward to several viewings.

i am always impressed when a director (and this case director/screenwriter) takes a piece of classical text - and makes it come alive. sure, shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self-importance, but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so - by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe-inspiring. there are many troubling things about the play. it is a racist play about racism - and that still sticks. i have never accepted jessica's desertion of her father without any acceptable reason. i have never accepted the christians' position of sanctimonious self-righteousness. but, brilliantly, there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set, and mercifully, much of jessica's part is cut.the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut. but, i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie - not just a film of the play.and at last, there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserving/unrelated bassanio - you can almost feel antonio's pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of bassanio passing by in a gondola, or arriving for a visit. but it is as subtle as that - no more. i was spellbound.there were many other highlights. i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking. and, the suitors' trials are hilarious.add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times, and you'll understand why i can't wait to see it again. and again.
