the finest short i've ever seen. some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened, due to the density of insight it offers. there's irony in that comment and little merit. the acting is all up to noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. i might have preferred that the narrator be less "recognizable", but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. this is a short for people who read, for those whose "bar" is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty. a beautiful short film. fwiw: i was pleased at the picasso reference, since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent; like, i assume, most people - until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was 12. picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime. i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for.

this is a very, very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.later in the film, he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head. oddly, this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life. this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor's novels--one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them.see this weird film--it's amazingly compelling and not like anything i've ever seen before.

alfred hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it certainly isn't a bad film, he does appear to be right. that being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among hitchcock's best work. that's certainly not to say that it isn't good, it's just more than a little overindulgent, and that drags it down. hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. some of these dragged out sequences, such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in, but for every restaurant scene, there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse.the plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife that go to morocco for a holiday with their young son. while there, they meet a french man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. however, things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him. the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it, and it manages to hold this all the way through. in fact, i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made. like most of hitchcock's films, this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. there is also more than a little humour in the movie, which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on, and actually works quite well.the original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre. this film doesn't benefit from his presence, unfortunately, but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart, and doris day. james stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time' crown. his collaborations with hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him, and this one is no different. (although his best performance remains the one in mr smith goes to washington). stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly. in fact, that's one of the best things about this film; you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling. doris day, on the other hand, is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. she's definitely a good actress, but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd (even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little).as i've mentioned; this is not hitchcock's best film, but there's much to enjoy about it and although i'd recommend many hitchcock films before recommending this one, i'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well.

the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom. of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. the original film was shot inside a studio.for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him (paramount)decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget. this is shot on location in marrakesh and london and has two big international names for box office. this was james stewart's third of four hitchcock films and his only teaming with doris day and her only hitchcock film.i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again. at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock favored. possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much. her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who befriended them in morocco. stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene. but doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in morocco and they make the acquaintance of frenchman daniel gelin and the aforementioned english couple, bernard miles and brenda dabanzie. gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in marrakesh and whispers some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london. their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film. doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. the song was que sera sera and i remember it well at the age of 9. you couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising elvis presley that year. que sera sera won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in 80 days. it became doris day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.instead of doing it with mirrors, hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. you'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.this was remake well worth doing.

anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one. great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time. lou myers, as half-step wilson, provides many hilarious moments.

many funny scenes about the people that you don't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do. lou myers was very funny as half-step wilson. any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non-movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie.

although bullet in the brain is, without question, superior amongst short films, it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film. and it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot. but after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place. there is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast. a slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit. despite these complaints, there is no denying that bullet in the brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short, and even full length films. the makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and hollywood action.

a gem from japan, where so many of the world's best films are being made today. stylistically, this isn't anything all that special. it's just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people going about their lives. yuko tanaka, best known for voicing the character lady eboshi in princess mononoke, plays a 50 year old spinster. she's takes pride in her health, spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of nagasaki. after she is done with this part time job, she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store (called s-mart, which made this army of darkness fan giggle). along her milk route lives a 50 year old man, whose wife is dying. it turns out the milk woman and the man, a child services worker, dated in high school, and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other. the film actually has some major narrative problems. when the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique. the climactic sequence is also really forced. but most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters, as well as many side characters. the film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down, but never end up doing so. i think the best thing in the film is tanaka's heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. whatever the problems were, the film mostly transcends them.

some people may call "cooley high" the same sort of thing as "american graffiti", but i wouldn't. for starters, in "ag", everyone was white, whereas in "ch" they're all black. moreover, this one has a motown soundtrack. specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class african-american students in 1964 chicago and their antics. the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. in their apartments, we see that there's never any dad around. but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. but overall, the main star is the soundtrack. it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). a classic in the real sense of the word.

you want a movie that'll take you places? well this is a good pick. if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the hayday of motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. at the risk of sounding cliche, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll reminisce and remember. you'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. you'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. it's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism--misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. i think everyone regardless of race, age, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it. so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film; there are much worse ways you could spend your time.

at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece (set in the early 60's, complete with a flawless motown soundtrack). but there's so much more to this film - it gets better every time i see it. the cast of unknowns (at the time) is excellent, and it is notable as an all-black-cast film that doesn't fall into any blaxpoitation clichés - at times cooley high almost feels like an updated, urban neo-realist film, with lots of edgy humor added in. at times, the rather tight budget does show, but the constraints actually serve the film well - there's a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar-minded films (like schultz' later car wash, which was more popular, but largely pointless) warm-hearted but also true-to-life, this might be one of the sleepers of the 70s - celebrated at the time, it seems that few film freaks know about this one today. their loss - this is a fine, fine film.the bare-bones pan-and-scan dvd (no widescreen!?!) is testament to just how little cared-for this excellent film is.

this film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast. glynn turman, (preach jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend. lawrence hilton jacobs, (cochise morris) was an outstanding athlete at the cooley h.s. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. there are scenes in this picture with the chicago police department chasing all these dudes in a cadillac and a visit to the lincoln park zoo with monkey dung being thrown around. the music is outstanding and there is great photography around the city of chicago. great film, enjoy.

the movie was very good when it came out, i attended cooley high and cooley upper grade center ,around 1968 i was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the area of cabrini greens, i knew a lots of people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in the area also, and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a once in a life time experience for them, i had good times growing up on the north side and tough times i can relate to the movie cooley high is no longer standing but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up attending cooley high, there is a lot of history around this north side area to be told .

cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy. it was a reflection of high school life back in the day. i attended coolidge high in washington, d.c. from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge. as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge "cooley high." getting high, shooting dice, chasing girls, basement parties, and fights, that sums up high school life for many in d.c. back in the day. i can't forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s. the hits just kept coming. however, cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other. and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period. thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times. cooley high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories, some good, and some bad.

this this coming of age dramedy set in chicago in the early 60's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. the two central characters are leroy "preach" jackson (turman) and his best friend richard "cochise" morris (hilton-jacobs.) both of these boys have promising futures. preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. when they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends.things go wrong when preach and cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. the police pursue them and they are arrested. but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (snl's garrett morris) they are released. but the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on preach and cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them.this movie is very episodic, but it still works because thats what life is, a series of episodes. some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. like preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or dealing with a bratty younger sibling. but even when a situation isn't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'cooley high' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'what's happenin!' which aired on abc from 1976-1979. even though the show is most famous for the character rerun, he is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. the humor of that show was very broad, but still funny. the humor of 'cooley high' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining.additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful. classic songs from that period by diana ross & the supremes, the temptations, martha & the vandellas, and smokey robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant tone of the film.

...instead, watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid 1960's in the ghettos of chicago. for all of you out there under the age of 50, "what's happening" was a light-hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood. i liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. "cooley high" started out as being the basis for "what's happening", but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, even though the credits on "what's happening" still read that it was based on this movie.this film starts out light, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960's and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. the guys deal with sex, betrayal, joblessness, hopelessness, and even early death. the ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great motown soundtrack. highly recommended. unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either.

cooley high is considered one of my best all time movies. it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early, mid, and late 1960's. what ever happened to brenda and pooter? some one need's to track those two down. brenda for her beauty and pooter for his innocent wit. they both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie. i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame. all of the cast of this movie was great. my opinion is of " cooley high " is turn back the hands of time, those were the fun years.

cooley high is such a great film that even with the period's sound track, urban landscape, wardrobe and slang...it still doesn't feel dated. the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself.instead it absorbs you right into it. that is a staple of a good movie. from start to finish it doesn't miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching it.it's ending is unique in the respect that it's one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings. there may have been a few since (backdraft comes to mind) but cooley was the first and much more emotional.

"cooley high" is one of my favorite movies ever!!! i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny. this movie was also referred to as a "black american graffiti". glynn turman is wonderful as preach and lawrence hilton-jacobs is great as preach's friend cochise. there are some other great characters in it as well, and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it. from the beginning of the movie where cochise goes to preach's home to get ready for school to the sad ending of cochise's funeral, this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way. there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot. the scene where pooter (another one of preach and cochise's friends) go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt (very gross, but funny as well), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quarter party at this girl's house which became a disaster due to a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album, which is packed with a lot of wonderful motown hits and artists from the early 60s (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in '75, while the rest were from the '60s). the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school, but their futures seem almost out of reach, due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for, and preach's relationship with his girlfriend, brenda (played by cynthia davis) almost gets put in jeopardy. go out and rent or buy this movie, and be ready for a load of comical entertainment!!! get the soundtrack, too. it is a lot of fun as well!!!

this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975. i was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive-in theatre. i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time (i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie). after seeing it on the television-along with two of my other favourite movies car wash (my favourite movie) and the wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together-about 40, 50, 75 times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites. those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child. i would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie.cochise and preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the wild irish rose that they drank. my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life. if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now. i'm glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era.

read this:boyz 'n the hood is a scene-by-scene, complete rip-off of this movie.two friends in the hood, one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. the friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed. (the athlete just happens to be washington from 'welcome back, kotter'.)it makes me mad that people don't know this. it blows my mind everytime i go into a video store and boyz 'n the hood is in the 'drama' section while cooley high is in 'comedy'. it's an embarrassing disgrace. this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john singleton's rip-off. at least singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to cooley high, but no, he never said a word. boys 2 men, however, named their hit record after this film.

this film set the standard for african-american film excellence when it was made. i heard on various stories on the film through time, that there was a push for an academy award nomination when it was released. this film plays on various emotions, and you definitely feel for all of the characters. sure, some of the acting is a little wooden, but fortunately, those parts aren't pivotal. the music is sensational, and if you don't think the ending is a tear-jerker, you have no heart in your chest. if you watch "cooley high", you will see that many, many films have copied various elements from it in order to strengthen their own films. the biggest example of this is "boyz n the hood".

now, i am not prone to much emotion, but i cried seeing this movie. it certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups, but there is something here for everyone. the classic song "it's so hard to say goodbye" really makes this one worth watching at least once.

after reading a biography on the last russian tzar (nicholas ii), and his failure to secure the army's support, i decided to give this film a try.i watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).these are the things that impressed me the most.1) the shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. more than once i stopped to think "if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer-generated".2) the realism in it. from the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend "killed for a bowl of soup", this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause (which, thankfully, hadn't been invented yet).3) the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence. from the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. still, the shots are composed... until the cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. this scene is easily worth the price of admission.4) the fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. then again, when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with "propaganda"; only a different kind.overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. nevertheless, metropolis, the cabinet of dr. caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.

have wanted to see this for a while: i never thought i'd be watching it in a damp trafalgar square, london with 15,000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys.quickly, that experience specifically. a new departure from psb, it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short ones, i.e. songs. psb produced a more fluid, integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms. neither could they resist song: a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was, i'd go so far to say, counterproductive. overall it was very exciting though, which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve.it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action. in fact the film, though beautifully shot and passionately acted (it has a silent film melodrama, but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style) breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in. and there's a huge range of perspective too; either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time.super film, which can be assessed irrespective of sound, as that's how the finished product would have been conceived. 8/10

the famous closeup of their breakfast meat, crawling with maggots still is recorded by fire in my neurons or the wind filling the right places of the sails, the fog better than carpenter's the fog cos is the real terror bursting out from human history instead of pirates ghosts. but , i tell ya' something: not even the magnificent scene in homenage performed by brian di palma with the excellent music of ennio morricone in the untochables (filmed in slow motion)can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the ladders. we see not merely the baby stroller but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by militar boot, someone with no feet escaping at the last minute, someone wearing glasses (then a cut edition) and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through....mini stories in a single scene.

/*may contain spoilers, but of course it does not matter :) */battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images. the visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the sheer scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. what is really amazing is, to my mind, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self-)referentialism of today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered.btw, the previous poster noted: "eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you. it's a little cheap. i would've rather seen a huge final action scene."i must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes. history, however, was. potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film.finally, i'd strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. see it with a fellow movie buff, it kept me talking for hours. however, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as "great" or "classic", to be "slow" or "boring", this film might not be for you yet. not much cheap entertainment here.for me though, it is a full 10/10.

the movie takes place during the year 1940 and the french are about to loose the war.the movie includes all genres: comedy, romantic, murder and history. it is probable the historical part may be not as probable as the rest.it is not, however, a big laugh movie but the occasional large smile!

[minor spoilers follow]steve allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula: tragedy+time=comedy. 1939 before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events, including the blitzkrieg (following the sitzkrieg) which took germany to the channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine france prostrating its honor before the nazi conqueror.the stuff of romance, comedy and a big dollop of serious drama? yep. director jean-paul rappeneau, with a well-matched and outstanding cast, creates in "bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining.viviane denvers (the sloe-eyed and beautiful isabelle adjani) is france's top actress as war clouds gather over europe (what an overused cliche, sorry). a veteran self-venerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be "whatever is good for viviane is good for...viviane). following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration, jean-etienne beaufort (gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, she goes home only to tiredly encounter an ex-lover who doesn't understand the word "no." she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau, the still besotted frederic (gregory derangere), to help deal with the mess in her flat. frederic is a novelist-in-expectation.a comic accident that once again highlights, almost as a public service message, the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges. fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes, making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state.the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story. who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant, camille (virginie ledoyen) who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist, professor kopolski (jean-marc stehle). kopolski has some bottles of "heavy water" he needs to get to england. of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what (this part is pure fiction-there was never any heavy water in france in 1940-just perrier). and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated.what next? peter coyote as a supposed french journalist, alex winckler. be tipped off as to his name. he's really an officer in the abwehr (german military intelligence: a spy). and he used to bed viviane too (and wants a reprise of their affair). apparently the kind kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress.what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast-paced and enjoyable film. partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on "casablanca," this is is a remarkably funny movie (except for the heavy nazi bits).isabelle adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal i've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few if any redeeming features. and depardieu, disloyal to reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor, petain, is convincing as a man whose ardor for viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the republic. as a human being in power at a critical moment in french history, beaufort is mundanely vile.not shown in too many theaters, "bon voyage" should be available for purchase or rental soon. see it!9/10

the stark, cold landscape of big sky country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains, is put to poetic use here in this lynchian fable/slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers (who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating "twin falls idaho"--a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be siamese twins). a little orphan boy is dying, and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress (in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant). with its eerily pleasing music score, minimalist dialogue and character development, and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels, the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about, the moving pictures...the images, the scenes...paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid. this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep. the fact that all of this was done on a shoe-string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future.

michael polish's hypnotic "northfork" is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time. this exquisitely crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote, is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. the movie is splendidly photographed by m. david mullen, with a haunting score by stuart matthewman.if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.the idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers. never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in "northfork". we don't need any color! the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpost.at the center of the story is irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious father harlan. this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body. but is he really there at all? we watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery. there are two freshly open graves. will one of them be for irwin? at the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can. this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created. their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people.the third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower hercules, cup of tea, cod and happy. they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area. when irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers to help, only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. we watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible. could irwin be that angel? the closing sequence show us all parties leaving northfork in different directions. the men in black riding their automobiles, perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward. the mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place. we also realize that the child in father harlan, in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the saintly figure, has died.michael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals. nick nolte, as father harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man. james woods, as walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a fine job. the biggest surprise is duel farmer, who makes an excellent impression as irwin. this child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise.the mystical group is brilliantly acted by daryl hannah, robin sachs, ben foster and anthony edwards, the man with the funny spectacles. peter coyote, mark polish, ben foster, and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr. polish direction.the beauty of the film relies in its simplicity. mr. polish's vision will haunt one's memory. the images of montana, as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while.

the third film from the polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. though many audiences will have a problem with northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "stick with it, jack!". the plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, god in a cowboy hat, the selling of angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). m. david mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. the performances of the actors, working with the polish brothers' inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional punch. the strong-willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera. again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. a great, great, great movie!!!

it's a shame this movie is rated pg 13--it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well.it belongs to that wonderful genre of serio-comic ghost/angel stories that would have to include everything from capra's "it's a wonderful life" to wenders's "wings of desire." the photography is stunning, the acting first rate, and--wonder of wonders--the tone is uplifting.my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. the two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste. as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd, all the ingredients of irwin's story are on his bedside table. the symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me.but what a lark! my favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner. this is practically theatrical in its magic--a tour de force of witty acting--subtle, playful, and positively rhythmic--coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque."northfork" is funny, touching, gorgeous to look at, magical (with the above reservations) and has not one single car-chase.an easy nine stars.

"it all depends on how you look at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says the priest rev. harlan in "northfork." the polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up, provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of christianity. the layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid-back american to reflect on current social values. the film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who nearly "crucify" their feet to wooden floor of their homes, angels who need multiple glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half toys that are alive, of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts, etc.) could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment. though european cinema has better credentials in this field, hollywood has indeed made such films in the past in "cat ballou", lee marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap, several decades ago. "northfork," in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars, seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in "citizen kane" taking kane and his wife out of xanadu for a picnic.the film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film-goerthe most interesting epilogue (one of the finest i can recall) can be heard as a voice over towards the end of the credits. the directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can stay with film to the end. if you have the patience you will savor the layers of the filmif you gulp or swallow what the polish bothers dish out, you will miss out on its many flavors.what is the film all about? at the most obvious layer, a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric-project. even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds. real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.at the next layer, you have christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. most are devout christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true christian principles, exemplified in the priest. many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.at the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. you realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called "flower hercules." while the filmmaker does give clues that flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of flower belie this option. you are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. the softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.at another layer the toy plane of irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from norfolk.the final layer is the social commentary"the country is divided into two types of people. fords people and chevy people." is there a difference? they think they are different but both are consumerist.to the religious, the film says "pray and you shall receive" (words of fr harlan, quoted by angel flower hercules). to the consumerist, the film says "its what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).the film is certainly not the finest american film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially nick nolte), and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.

a dreamy, stunningly atmospheric film takes place in a small town of northfork, montana in 1955. the government officials arrive to evacuate the town about to be inundated by a new hydroelctrical dam. there are the other visitors in the town, the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy irvin. a local priest (nick nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them...there is some unearthly quality in the film, some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. i cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as "northfork" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. even now, after several weeks since i saw it, tears come to my eyes when i only think of it.after i saw it, i had to talk to somebody about it. i sent a pm to one of my friends and i asked, "please tell me what i just saw?" and my friend replied with the words, "you just saw one of the greatest films of modern times. one of these days others will see the light."

when northfork debuted at the cannes film festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. while i agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), in no way was it boring. as roger ebert said, `there has never been a movie like northfork.' i usually don't agree with ebert, but for once he speaks the truth. although john sayles' sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish brothers' northfork.northfork is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art-house film instead of the latest jack black movie. the plot isn't some hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; it's just so strikingly original. a small town in montana named northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. therefore, the entire town must be evacuated. some people, however, just don't want to leave. in a side plot, a young orphan (duel farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he's being taken care of by father harlan (nick nolte). the boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who help him out through his time of sickness.although much of the movie is straightforward, some of it could give david lynch a run for his money. there's odd weather patterns, a weird, wooden, huge dog thing, and symbolism that would make fellini proud. it's not as overall confusing as a lynch film, but it's still quite odd. that's what makes northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible.northfork has a magical feel to it: it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. as i said earlier, i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other. however, i disagree when he says that it is `not entertaining'. he goes on to say it's just `enthralling.' perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is, but in lieu of how slow it was, i still thought it was very entertaining, something many dramas now can't do.northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to and through it, you'll be extremely surprised, as i was.my rating: 8/10rated pg-13 for brief sexuality.

the polish brothers are unique film artists, and they've really pushed the envelope here. a fantasy that has points in common with "wings of desire," "northfork" tells the story of a '50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the u.s. government's desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands. it's a wry parable about loss and remembrance, featuring angels, dreams, premonitions, and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since "repo man." the performances are all outstanding, especially nolte and woods. i've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and i want to say, that's one of the things that makes this film so great: its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. david mullen's cinematography is stunning. highly recommended; if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss, such as the death of a parent, i would even call this film necessary viewing. - ray

it's pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone. if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made. too bad you would have been watching it alone. probably the reason you hate it... no game. keys to the vip is hilarious, light and funny. guys are going to eat this show up. my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show. the chicks were hooooot and the clubs kicked ass. i'll be watching every week. it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren't being made. now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television.

don't mind what this socially retarded person above says, this show is hilarious. it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are. the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original. its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a days.give it a chance everyone, we are only one episode in, we finally have some canadian programming that isn't absolute crap. as canadians what do we normally get, bon cop, bad cop, or corner gas. come on people show that we are all not as prudish as the previous reviewer.way to go comedy network, giving a new show a chance. the panel is funny and the contestants so far are pretty good.

keys to the vip, an original series by the canadian comedy network (comedynetwork.ca) scored big with this entertaining, yet inspirational gameshow. this show is hosted by four funny, good-looking guys who judge others on their 'game' (ability to pick up women). each episode features two guys who go head-to-head in various pick-up games. there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night-club.being a guy, i naturally find this show hilarious. we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men. the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers -- if you pay attention.

i don't know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment. basically 2 dudes are put in competitions at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time. the panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game. they will break down what the guy did wrong, and what they guy did right. some contestants are weak, some are strong but what happens is always entertaining. if you are a guy that goes out, you can relate. i've seen weak game, i've seen strong game, and this show is for real. no doubt.

for all losers who gave it negative review,its because you probably have sex once in 2 years,or you are in ltr with one girl for years. and guess what ? she is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere.off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show. and that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys.. its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman.what these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing-not approaching at all.for anybody who has open mind i recommend to read the book "the game" by neil strauss.it deals with similar theme as this show

i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) comment on them, choosing the winner. their jokes are amusing, and some participators are really fun to watch. more so, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, lots of expert's comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field. actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men, who like women.ps/ pardon for my broken engrish.

the acrobatics mixed with haunting music, make one spectacular show. the costumes are vibrant and the performances will just boggle your mind! simply amazing!

wow, don't watch this thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus evening! it will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. circus has never been more colourful, more exciting and more breathtaking! the whole concept is truely amazing. you're taken into the world of cirque du soleil and are left with a thousand thoughts when you leave. there's only one thing left to do: get the cd and/or dvd and live through it again and again and again. get addicted! it's well worth it! must be next to the most beautiful thing on earth and one of cirque du soleil's best programmes.

this performance leaves you with no wishes. we saw it in offenbach, germany, and it is breathtaking. we only got the cheap tickets at the far back but still had a view over everything that happened. if you ever get the chance to see this live then go! it is worth the trip and if i were you i would wait a good half an hour after the show to 'cool down'. the performances are breathtaking and all around the tent there are colourfully dressed performers that are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent come alive. the music - live music!! - is as good as the cd-version: perfect! i bought a dvd later but the show that was filmed had less colourful costumes. it's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. a great trip for old and young, and a great film, too

i purchased this video on vcr tape in a good-will store for us 50 cents. i have taken quite a few videos i purchased back for them to sell to others after i viewed them considering the 50 cent cost as a rental. this is the only one that will never go back. it is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. i don't know if i should calls it circus, dance, or both. it is bigger than life itself. they will only be able to do this well for just a few brief years in their life. these are the performers for the performers. if gene kelly and burt lancaster were alive today and saw them live they would be awe-struck. i would lend it to others to watch but i know if i do that i will never get it back.

i had the pleasure of seeing saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the show. while nothing can compare to actually being there, the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor, the feel, the sensation and so much more. the wonderful performances of saltimbanco's stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout. the video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. a wonderful experience.

i used to watch this show when i was growing up. when i think about it, i remember it very well. if you ask me, it was a good show. two things i remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. the writing was also very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i haven't seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

being a 90's child, i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons.i don't know why; early 90's cartoons had something special; i don't know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere, a generational change, whatever. but "tiny toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show. easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character. every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.

after the success of "muppet babies" warner brothers chalked up "tiny toons". but instead of making bugs bunny, daffy duck and all the rest of the looney toon gang kids, they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors. the leads included buster & babs bunny (no relation, which became their running gag or catch phrase), plucky duck, hampton pig, dizzy devil, shirley 'the' loon, elmira, montana max, furball, sweety, the rats and assorted animals of perfecto prep, and the original looney toons cast themselves. the "tiny toons" lived in acme acres and attended acme looniversity, where the looney toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy.during the show's run, various pot shots were taken at the bush sr. administration, pop culture, and coupled with various other gags and spoofs.buster & babs, arguably the show's main characters, as mentioned above, were similar to bugs bunny in some respects, but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles, namely, babs' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone, while buster, capable of being a great goof himself, usually played straight man (or straight rabbit) to babs' antics. plucky duck was a virtual copy of daffy duck (not screwball daffy but egomaniac daffy), with nearly as big an ego as daffy and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the buster & babs as daffy had with upstaging bugs, though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely endearing through out. hampton was an even more shy version of porky pig, and he had the thankless job of playing porky to plucky's daffy. shirley, the blond duck gal, was a new age valley girl type whom plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections. dizzy was the purple version of the tasmanian devil. furball was the silent sylvester and sweety was the pink tweetie bird. there was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of wile coyote and the road runner. evil was defined in the form of montana max, a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable. there was also elmira, a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared. and then there was godo dodo, an odd thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from "wacky land" or something like that.pop culture references included batman (quite frequently actually), michael jackson, vanilla ice, dances with wolves, indiana jones, star trek, supergirl, fast food joints, the ten commandments, the twilight zones, saturday night live and even the simpsons, among others.not only funny, but it also managed to be warm and touching, something it's successor "animaniacs" never quite attained. also followed by "taz-mania".

ok, the show was a little uneven, but i still loved it. i found the main two bunnies annoying, but hamton & plucky were always amusing.i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd (or even vhs). please release those!specifically the "potty years" episode aired on 11/22/91; the "going up" episode aired on 9/17/92 and the "minister golf" episode in 11/92.they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits!(i have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and rewards us for brevity!)

they just don't make cartoons like they used to. this one had wit, great characters, and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show. this still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows, and one of the most honored, winning several emmy awards.

it's now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. i haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. now that i'm an adult in my 30s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes again.in concept, the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show. there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. for example, there is a singer that attacks buster and so he exacts revenge on this singer's concert -exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon. the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes, just in a different era. if you look at the old looney tunes, they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny toons did. the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody. there were celebrity impersonations. there were a lot of corny period jokes, slang, and dialog. the comedy was surreal and wacky. you can say this exactly for tiny toons as well. the comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this show. we recognize the cultural references in tiny toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. but the reason we don't think looney tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. also, looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. so it's easy to perceive tiny toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.there certainly are differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. they are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny toons being made for kids watching tv. even so, they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old looney tunes.since tiny toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. you only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. for example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in thirteensomething when babs and buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. the miscommunication is spectacular. notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or sherri stoner) is rather good. the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. this was way ahead of its time. tiny toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. yes, i loved transformers and thundercats, but tiny toons totally jumped away from all that. it was a breath of fresh air. bakshi's new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a precursor, but tiny toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes. for example, one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen. now i have a newfound respect for it. there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. it's that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy. i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. i've been thinking this for most episodes i watched recently.you'd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show. unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it, i've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. i'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. but back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. tress macneille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. she hasn't been the same since. rob paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.this is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. it had plenty. it had a lot of mediocre ones, too. but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.out of 10 i give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.

this is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare, besides that it's a lot of fun.hardware wars is the only good spoof on star wars, other films like spaceballs have failed. this is the only good spoof film i have ever seen, it doesn't rip-off star wars, it makes fun of it, and that's what spoofs are supposed to be.

this ranks as my favorite movie of all time. it's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a sendup of star wars just made it all the better.i love slapstick. think of this as the marx brothers or the three stooges meet star wars. the writing is hilarious. the effects are a hoot. the free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of left field. (i almost wet my pants when the wookie monster accosted the princess.)space balls was a much longer movie, but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it, and i felt sort of ripped off afterwards, like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler. hardware wars, despite being only about 15 minutes long, would be worth paying a feature price, imo.

hardware wars is a hilarious, 12 minute short film parody of the original star wars movie which was released just a few months after star wars in 1977. this film uses household appliances as space ships and star wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. this film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired mel brooks to write his star wars parody movie called "spaceballs".this is my favorite parody film and i recommend it to anyone who is familiar with star wars and has a good sense of humor.

talk about your classics! ernie fossilus (the foss from here on out) came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing star wars. this gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags i laugh every time! not only that, when star wars did a re-issue with new special effects, hardware wars did the same! talk about a spoof that just won't die! there's a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody. he was so impressed, he even hired the foss to work on "return of the jedi" (don't believe me, check his entry in imdb!)this has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. i think the special edition was a bit overdone, but on reflection, i think it's perfect for the modern day re-release of star wars, and goes to prove that sometimes, it's wrong to mess with perfection.yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time.you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $3 goodbye! well, maybe 15 for the dvd, but you'll be real happy you did.

fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace, and far more entertaining, if you ask me. hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days. i hate to describe it too much-it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing. suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them. household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots, the princess anne-droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair, and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original, if that's possible. ernie fosselius is one crazy son-of-a-buck-he's also the source of porklips now, the apocalypse now spoof.

so funny is the perfect way to describe this 12 minutes spoof of the original star wars. hardware wars is incredibly funny. it is presented as the trailer of the space epic hardware wars. the joke is this: imagine star wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. the characters include the "intergalactic boy-wonder" fluke starbucker, the "ace mercenary and intergalactic wise guy" ham salad, darph nader, "villain" and a host of other fantastic characters. it is impossible not to laugh as you watch this 12 minutes treasure. it's stupid but it's fun. you will laugh from the start to the end, and you will feel the need to watch it again, and again, and again, and again... and you will laugh every time you see it!!!10 out of 10. the funniest 12 minutes ever made. you will believe it lasted a minute!

i just want to say that i was thrilled to find these comments about the show. i have tried online searches for info about the show in the past with no luck. i loved the show. i have a hard time getting motivated to exercise but this show made it fun. as another comment mentioned that it wasn't so complicated as the routines nowadays. it was an ideal workout that got the job done! i would give anything to be able to buy a copy of just one workout. i remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it. somebody please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on dvd. it is so great to know i wasn't the only one that loved that show! thanks for making my day!

after my daughter was born in 1983, i needed to lose weight. i tried the 20 minute workout and i was hooked. i lost about 50 lbs. it was the most weight i ever lost in my life. i can't believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing if you started a cable channel strictly for exercise and included the 20 minute workout. i think this was the best workout video ever made. i wish i could purchase it somehow and somewhere. the routine was easy to learn and you did work up quite a sweat. the workouts they have today are too complicated and too hard to learn. please do your best to get this video back in circulation. i pray it will be a blessing to all who see and use it.

aah yes the workout show was a great. not only did many women get in shape, but many teenage boys got a great workout as well. i am not saying that the show was in any way not appropriate for family viewing, but if you check the other works from the shows producer, you will find more adult themes in his works, which are also excellent. many of the viewers looked forward to the show, men and women alike all gained good information and a wonderful release,from the workouts. the girls were perfect, and beautiful, the show is a classic and should do well in syndication. the show should still be on, as there are never enough choices to view when it comes to health and beauty.

another great performance by kiefer sutherland. i love his movies, because he always plays his role very well. for a low budget film, this was done very good, and kept me on the edge the whole time. i love these type of movies, and i was glad i caught it on. i'll be buying the dvd or tape for sure.9/10.

i got a few laughs out of this one, more than a lot of other so called comedies. the big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of it's scenery was fun: as was getting to see some of dyan cannon's curves. this wasn't the height of lemmon's and mattheau's career, but it wasn't a total dog as some suggest.

i thought this film was excellent, quirky and different to the usual run of the mill 'disengaged cop catching serial killer' film. kiefer sutherland was brilliant as usual - i really don't think i have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly. the dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood, and the plot engaging. thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with alice in wonderland - i hadn't picked up on those. i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of kiefer sutherlands (as i am) and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours. it was a shame that it wasn't released at the cinemas for a wider audience.

i really liked this movie. if other people want to give it an average around 5.0/10 that's their choice. i would give it 10/10. sutherland's performance as a private eye is totally awesome. the story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. the dialogue is good. the story might not be perfect but anyway - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that. moreover, the ending is incredibly cool and their the jig-saw puzzle really comes back to together. so anyway i liked it. i also thought the female lead actress performed very well. i'm not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good, also because it doesn't give a damn about conventions of the supernatural.

while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, i think it is better than most over all. i mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling. it's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game! :d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are. i'd recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one.7/10

movies aren't always suppose to be about deep, provolking thoughts. sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality. out to sea fits the bill perfectly. a light hearted "golden years" romantic comedy, out to sea may not be big budget, you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still very much a movie worth watching. a sweet movie that needs to be given a break. this is just good, light hearted fun. it's not meant to be a deep movie. it's something worth watching. if for nothing else, you must see it for brent spiner's humorously stiff and uptight rendition of oye como va. gil is a character you love to hate and mr. spiner pulls off the perfect evil comic foil to two beloved comedy movie gods.

a competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of jack lemmon and walter matthau. i suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two grumpy old men films, as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team-ups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years. the idea is a sure-fire one: matthau, a bumbling gambler who's thousands of dollars in debt, connives his unsuspecting friend lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies; the catch is, they've been signed on as dance hosts and matthau can't dance.out to sea is a funny film, and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of lemmon and matthau. i found brent spiner (best known as data from star trek: the next generation) to be very humorous as the snobby ball-busting dance coordinator. as the prissy boss of the two aging actors, he manages to match them in the laughs department. though the film doesn't really need any, there's also a a love story or two to be found here as well, involving dyan cannon (who looks pretty fine for her years).

for people like me who were born long after the '60s ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts, of which "hair" is one. this is certainly a well done tour de force. one can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crashes the rich people's party. as for the movie's final scene, one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the '60s represented.but no matter how one interprets this movie, it's important to understand that even though the '60s themselves may have ended, the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves. it's a time that people won't soon forget.anyway, this movie is one that i definitely recommend. milos forman scored another great one here, right between his two masterpieces "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" and "ragtime" (so why did he later make a piece of crap like "man on the moon"?!). starring john savage, treat williams and beverly d'angelo.

watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. there never is the perfect crime, and armored showed why. the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. the last hour of the film is very entertaining. matt dillon is still a very good actor. hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age. i would buy this movie. i give armored eight out of ten. not a christmas movie. did i write ten lines yet? nope! anyways, there is not to many action films. armored has a lot of excitement in it, which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy.

well unlike most people.... i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film. pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors. they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together. it's a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesen't quite turn out how you predicted. i don't want to give away anything about the story so i wont... but i suggest giving this one a chance. if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie. maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold?

flashes of lightning; a sprawling cemetery; the name of adam 'batman' west: all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over, and yet, despite these rather naff elements, one dark night isn't as cheesy as it might first seem.meg tilly (jennifer's sister) plays pretty student julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters. what julie doesn't realise is that the other 'sisters' plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of 'psychic vampire' raymar, who feeds off the life force of scared young women.admittedly, this isn't the most original of set-ups, but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition, my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymar's apartment, and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale. hal trussell's impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burman's wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere.

i have great memories of this movie...i was only 12 when it was released and it scared the bejesus out of me. i really miss my bejesus...zombies, graveyards, mausoleums, how can you go wrong? it's like phantasm's retarded cousin.this movie was released 1 year before the pg-13 rating was instituted.i submit that one dark night is the goriest pg movie (not scariest, mind you) that has ever been released.can anyone come up with a gorier pick?(fyi: i don't consider poltergeist to be gorier...scarier, yes. but not gorier...)

i can't describe the feeling when i got this crappy vhs rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago. somehow i got my father to rent it for me and i watched it twice with my little brother. yes, we got nightmares. this film was originally rated as pg in the us, in many other countries, including finland, it was restricted under 18 or 16. the film was aimed to teenagers, but this must be the goriest pg-rated film ever. there's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever. originally made in 1981, stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release.this is an a-class b-movie, a true, well made 80's horror flick. a bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a mausoleum, not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits... you can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. it's campy, utterly stupid, but they just can't make these movies anymore. there is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre. this one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years.the effects are just oozing quality by ellis burman jr and thomas r. burman. the make-up effects play a big part in this flick, otherwise it would've been just a boring teen slasher.it's now available on dvd at last and it's a special edition dvd including some extras too. commentary track is interesting.(in fact, this version isn't so special after all. below average transfer on dvd, some glitches and scratches here and there) at first it was going to be released by the blue underground but unfortunately it was canceled, so shriek show released it without restoring the print. too bad!)great date-movie!recommended!!!note! i only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10

you have got to see this movie... i saw it, as a 13 year old, at the theater, on my very first date... fast forward over 20 years and i'm now gay (thanks a lot one dark night!! lol!). this movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid (mausoleums still do!), but as an adult, the thrill of this movie isn't in the storyline, but rather the hysterical laughs it holds... highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) to "turkey". also, keep your eyes peeled for the scene where carol (the blond, head sister) attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can (can't believe they didn't reshoot that!)... other highlights include adam west's overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses. if you're a fan of true horror, i'd suggest this film just because, to me, it's almost a parody on horror. there is def. a creepy factor and the plot is a good one, but don't watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits (unless you're like 10 years old or something).

i was kinda surprised by the pg rating on the back of the dvd case. i certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one. i think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old.plot: a girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the 'in crowd.' they talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum (that reminded me of phantasm...) and they proceed to torment her in the night. little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them! it sounds awfully cheesy, but given the age and the budget, which was no doubt pretty small, this film is fun on many levels.watch for an early eg daily as one of the in crowd brats. i enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend.7 out of 10, kids.

françois truffaut, young jerk of the "cahiers du cinema", main bastion of the coming so-called new wave, made a big show of hating this film and even accused it of dragging french cinema into mediocrity. translation: truffaut, who was terminally repressed sexually, was already jealous of the way carné could make a huge success of a story that pushed all the right buttons of its audience and actually involved it into something important with all the trappings and seduction of sensuality. in other words, where the general public and many critics saw a perceptive sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful film, truffaut saw "girls on the loose". carné, after all, had everything that would be severely lacking from the new wave: intelligence, refinement, humour, a great talent as a storyteller, a great ear for dialogue, dazzling technical brilliance, the capacity to make his actors do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. by comparison, truffaut is a provincial bore with nothing to say.a 50's tragic remake of "pride and prejudice", the french answer to "rebel without a cause", an updated version of "children of paradise", "les tricheurs" tells a story of disaffected parisian youth who have lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. some (young) critics perceived carné's take on the subject as the moralizing slant of an "older person", whereas i think what happened, quite to the contrary, is that carné being gay and knowing a thing or two about repression, felt an untold sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his story. furthermore, this being a french film, there is no mistaking that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that still had to be decoded in american films like "rebel without a cause" and "the wild one".carné's young people are all supremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. they are gods and goddesses. they drive the latest vespas and the right cars. the cut of their suits, dresses and duffle-coats was a high point of the fashions of the last century. their haircuts are still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser. their body shape, which they attained and maintained without effort, is still the modern western ideal. they listen to the best jazz musicians. they know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love  even though the pill hasn't yet been invented. they know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. unfortunately, they are defined by and live by the code of the gang and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love. the only thing wrong with them is that their elders don't talk to them and vice-versa. the incidents depicted in this film got a lot of tongues wagging for a long time in france about the amorality and nihilism of youth while still making it a huge public and critical success.this film is so stylish and gorgeous, i suspect the older viewers who watched it wished they could be like the people depicted in the film and quite a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice reflecting how they could never conceivably make a film as sexy or popular as this one, although they would be very good at eventually aiming for the nihilistic bits. on the other hand, given a certain clichéd aspect of the script (amorous misunderstanding leading to a medical emergency), one can only wonder at the horribly pious and puritanical mishmash americans would have extracted from the same basic script if they had dared to tackle the subject.interestingly, the movie was filmed in the same basic locations as the american musical "funny face" a year earlier. where hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of the rive gauche and existentialism, carné restituted its tragic and ironic dimension. watch this trailer on youtube: 19zkkeonjpo

it's generally an accepted fact that marcel carné's 1936-1946 movies are masterpieces and it's considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities.this is an unfair opinion:at least ,two of the latter era are eminently watchable:"thérèse raquin" ,his best post-war work,and "les tricheurs" (the cheats).there's a strange evolution from the prevert golden hour to "les tricheurs":in "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève",true love is thwarted by the villains. in "les tricheurs" true love does not exist anymore:we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing;falling in love would be incongruous for this youth.the adults are not the villains at all:mic's brother and mother are kind people ,but she is beyond their command.very few grown-ups appear anyway.during two hours,the characters do not stop playing around,dancing,listening to jazz records(a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture),and heavily drinking .when two of them discover they care for each others ,it will be too late.the cast is rather good ,laurent terzieff as an existentialist cynic and andréa parisy as a rich kid are the stand-outs.on the other hand,pascale petit and mainly jacques charrier(who married brigitte bardot the same year as "les tricheurs")do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for.they are all smile,too sweet and to nice to be believable.oddly,"les tricheurs" was labeled "nouvelle vague"!when you know what the priests of this cinema school (the likes of godard)thought of carné ,it's really a good joke.but this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing.

i blow hot and cold over carné. he really can be a puzzle for me. i think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. certainly a man who came to maturity in the thirties with the popular front seems ill at ease in the france of the fifties, with its rampant commercialism and heavy american influence. he is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. the party scenes go on much longer than they should, as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. roland lesaffre's character--he plays pascale petit's older brother--seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-style ideas are still sound.at two hours, this picture is far too long. still, let me praise pascale petit for her game performance; she was a natural who should have challenged brigitte bardot for sexpot supremacy, but somehow lost her way. andrea parisy is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the fifties). laurent terzieff is the only french actor who could play an anarchist convincingly: he is great here as he rescues a cat from death, then remarks he can't stand cats. jacques charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little grin and those blank eyes.

first, i rated this movie 10/10. to me, it's simply one of the best i saw since i was born (i'm 23, but i saw numerous films). the story is cruel, but reality is, too, not ? it went deep into me and stirred my bowels. i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and i still remember it !second, there is no 'national preference' (this expression is a direct translation from the french) for this movie. i mean it's not because it is a french movie that i put it so high : it has really caught me when i saw it. furthermore, i don't know well marcel carne's filmography, so i don't know if it is or not his best movie, but i know it is not his most famous : hotel du nord, quai des brumes and les enfants du paradis are the most famous.third, the movie's in b&w, but it deals with inter-temporal problems of youth (not acne) like love, friends and studies in a modern way. it could even be remade frame-by-frame with actual young actors, a dolby(tm) sound and special effects (a car crash), it would still be a great film !problem : maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and above, of course - for its message to be well understood... did i say it was a great movie ?

this late 50s french study of disaffected youth (in their early 20's, actually--"grown up", but not yet settled down into the adult world) probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 french youth (don't virtually all youth films made by adults do this? the ones that don't--river's edge comes to mind-- are rare indeed), but director-writer marcel carne, of les enfants du paradis fame, is too accurate an observer of humanity to not provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters. in a sense, the details are not important--you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well--but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters is captured well. the young pierre brice and jean-paul belmondo are in supporting roles, but leads jacques charrier, laurent terzieff, pascale petit, and andrea parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. there is also a fine jazz score, which you can get on the cd jazz in paris--jazz & cinema vol. 2. unlike some who have commented on the film, i don't really see director-writer carne as sitting in judgment on these characters--he seems as though he is an objective observer to me. of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some working-class viewers of the film, and i think carne is certainly aware of this. for this american viewer (i watched a dubbed, fairly literally i'd say, version of this titled the cheaters), the film provides an interesting window into the france of the 1950s. it also is self-consciously poetic (the scene on the ledge, saving the cat, is but one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only french films can get away with--i can imagine the heavy-handed, melodramatic, shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an american studio production, and the sensationalistic, moralistic, suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by american drive-in/exploitation filmmakers. i feel that marcel carne has captured the essence of that period between, say, high school graduation and when, by one's early 30s, people have largely settled into a routine, whatever that routine may be. those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. and even if you don't want to do that, you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack, with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop, including the wonderful original score by an american "jazz at the philharmonic" group including coleman hawkins, dizzy gillespie, stan getz (spelled "goetz" in the credits), roy eldridge, and ray brown.

as an adult, i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen. during the time, i was experiencing familial problems. this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world. how much peer pressure is too much? i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience. how far might an individual go for social acceptance? who is the "bad" crowd? teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions, but ultimately...who is the "pack leader" if there must be one? is it the strong? the beautiful? perhaps the person we just all seem to like? could it be the moral character? as far as the movie goes, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me. i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more.

i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night. i was viewing the beginning with one eye open, but instead of drifting off to sleep, i became invested in this crafty, nail-bitter of a movie. it was very believable and engaging. i could have done without so much profanity(as with every david mamet movie i see), but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. i know teenagers swear, but i don't need to listen to it. anyways, the story had some interesting surprises which i won't reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime, i think you will enjoy it as much as i have.

as a camera operator, i couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved. the performances were excellent, as was the story. just when i thought this film was about to slow down, it didn't. heart-pounding tension, great pacing through editing, and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction. the camera was always in the right place. love that.

born bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids. teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining. the movie is similar to the black circle boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences.

this is a great movie for all corey feldman fans. this movie has a great cast of young actors. a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash, but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages

i just watched the dvd version of born bad and found it to be tense, gritty and, near the end, too graphic for the faint of heart. justin walker (clueless) and corey feldman turn in superior performances. for a low budget film, this picture delivers. the depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a roger corman picture. check it out on dvd!

i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie. there's a lot of famous rome monuments and historical locations.it is from the same writer and director from the da vinci code. tom hanks stars along with ewan mcgregor and ayelet zurer. the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the illuminati. the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. its a race all of rome following the illuminati trail to get to the illuminati secret meeting place. while racing against time to find the path of the illuminati. over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it. it is a lot better than the movie 2010. and the ending has one awesome plot twist.

first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong. it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci. if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. however the big twist is still there so don't worry about that. finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub-plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together. the performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. that's okay for a film like this. i'd give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment

so first things first..angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da- vinci code.following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive gci and over the top action sequences.in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashioned.it offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is cern's large hadron collider facility.hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in da-vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being armin mueller-stahl's stoic cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it's pace. for the entire running time i was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. but that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.

as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code, i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons.hanks and company are back for the sequel-prequel angels and demons, and they have learned their lesson.acting wise everyone is much better. aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra, and better than the girl who played sophie neveau. tom hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller. i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors. he might even deserve a nomination come march, but doubtful. he had me convinced right until the very end. he's dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them. the minor actors also do very good jobs.technically and visually the movie is much improved. the cinematography is much...much better, and the visual effects are superb. the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. howard does a masterful job, taking you through a tour of rome.pacing wise, ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving, and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity. the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake. in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children, is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church. part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score. i cannot say enough about the score. it was epic at times, like something from lord of the rings, but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie, which is a nice mix.my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched. the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable, and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous. not to mention the whole antimatter thing, which has yet to be created, and dan brown wrote the book in 2003...overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt, faster paced, more exciting, and more important movie than the da vinci code. this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one.

as a fan of the old doctor who, and after the mediocre fox movie, i was dubious of this new series of doctor who. i gave it a chance though, and am so glad i did.yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, eccleston's doctor is far from any we've had before but... eccleston's doctor is just about the best there is. his performance is at times comical, at others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic.this, and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest (camille coduri is also fantastic as rose's mum), and there is a depth to this series not present previously. this series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its sci-fi. i mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this, how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with rose's dad, the emergency doctor and the 'you were fantastic...so was i' final speech? i advise anyone, whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd, it truly is "fantastic!".now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new cybermen) i have to say that david tennant's doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but i don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last, however the return of sarah jane & k9 was a fantastic episode, a true gem. not to say this series is not good, just not quite as good.so whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston, the doctor is back, and he's here to stay. "fantastic!" - almost as many "fantastic!"'s as the doctor! -

i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr. who. i've played them over and over. i adore each of the "doctors" for different reasons. but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy, dr. who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc line-up. with the departure of sylvester mccoy, the doctor stayed alive through the fans. bbc graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. the momentum of dr. who has been steady even after 1989. then they took a chance with paul mcgann. the movie was flawed, but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted. in 1999, the "man" was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back. it was a complete success. here in america, the sci-fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well, although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr. who mythology for new viewers. it is incredible to me that they have done it. in season 1, staring christopher eccleston with russell t. davis as lead writer, and phil collinson as producer, the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is. the doctor who universe has always been about "choice", "love" and "sacrifice". this is what they provided. it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr. eccleston has chosen to leave the show. my first doctor was doctor no. 3, jon pertwee's doctor. mr. eccleston needn't worry about his position in the dr. who universe. it is as solid as the rest. he is the 9th doctor. i didn't know of mr. eccleston prior to his performance in dr. who, but i do now. i wish there was some way, he could know, there is push out in the dr. who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it. we have already seen that he is a great actor.

i love pop culture, but i was a little apprehensive when i first heard about this. then, i seen an episode, and i love it! i was a little upset when i found out that christopher eccelson would no longer be playing doctor who. he was probably the best one they've had. he fits the character so well. it's sad to see him go. i really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as eccelson.i think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks. the story lines and characters can more than make up for that. i'm currently waiting for season two and i will review that as well, in case, for any reason, quality goes down.anyways, i think everyone should try to see one episode. i did, and i have been loving it ever since. well written, well casted, and well produced, this show is worth the hour of viewing. doctor who gets a 10/10

first off, i have been a fan of the show back when my pbs station started showing it back in 1981. i learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show.this latest installment of doctor who made a great impression on me. the original series, aka classic series, was made fun of by the bad special effects and/or wobbly sets. well, this is no more true. the special effects are awesome, but what is even better is the writing. you get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much. without giving too much away, it is a very worthwhile series to watch. christopher eccelston brought a side of the doctor that we never get to see, a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time.a must see!

i love dr who so much! i believe that david tennant is the best dr the show has ever had and billie piper the best companion! i liked the way the dr and rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! it sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. i will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without rose! but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role! i rate this show 110% it is fantastic! the graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love, the world and relationships from this show. therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!

it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of hollywood people.it was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festival.he made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his hollywood films with him as a potent action star.he was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stone.there should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society.this is the reason why chuck norris' statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restless.an honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he/she states that kieslowski's film "dekalog: dekalog,piec (#1.5)" has universal connotations.this is because the events depicted in dekalog 5 can happen in any part of world.the best lesson which kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just society.this is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in us.we would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold schwarzenegger,chuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificial.one can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiasts.kieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and misery.this is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide.

a brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state. so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment (from the preparation of the gallow to the victim p***ing in his own pants before dying) it has the power to change your mind about death penalty. the whole dekalog originated from this story: the dekalog screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused.

'identity . . . . i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (ntozake shange qtd in "fires in the mirror").pieces like decalogue v used to intimidate me. i felt that if i accepted them, than i would be compromising something. what i thought before really isn't worth getting into. i understand what naturalism is trying to say. i experienced a tangible katharsis, and one that fell into existence piecemeal, and one that's still alive, that i still have to reckon with. it's still working inside me. the film wasn't sympathetic, per se. it doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing. there are certainly wicked people; whether or not they should die is for another film. what decalogue shows is that good, beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up. the 'science' of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate decalogue v. it's not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before, but i see now the worth in making art like this to 'make' people, or perhaps to make people do something. there's a method to lazar's compromise of his . . . light. much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect. this should not be too strange of an idea: after all, how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect. i wince when i say it, but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when i have the power to say to myself, 'this ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me want to buck the system.' i do not think naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity, telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods. instead, i think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments, that we are, of course, free to ignore. we can ignore it all we want, if we want to give the naturalists more corpses to bury. for surely, despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters' likely and catastrophic fate, they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme. i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what's to be done with what they see. as has been mentioned, there's danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone. there's danger in the hopeful disparaging the natural because it doesn't correspond to their world view.and i don't think that the 'hopeful' need be either wealthy or fortunate. i have not seen it, but it seems that the film american beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort. there are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is, who grieve because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape. landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed, but in reality, landscapes do not enact. they change, sure, and dramatically, but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over. but it cannot be changed itself.

the dekalog 5 may be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment "thou shalt not kill": not by chance it puts the concept of a state fully complied with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a murderer. "but the law might not imitate the nature, it might correct it," states piotr, the counsel for the defense, a real catalyst character, "the punishment is a form of vengeance aiming at returning evil for evil without preventing the crime. but in the name of whom the law takes its revenge? really in the name of the innocent ones?". the horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals. "desperate plights don't demand desperate remedies", kieslowski says in his message, teaching us how unrighteous can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of god that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged. there are three different moral attitudes here: the innate sense of rebellion of the murderer aiming at rousing the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the victim inclined to laugh at other people's requirements; the deserving behavior of the counsel for the defense always ready to fight against adversity, in favor of human life. the struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all of the time; the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress, in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. everything in "dekalog 5" conveys a dreadful sense of estrangement and isolation: descriptions of a waste undergrowth of violence and folly, scenes of precarious conditions of work, sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, aimless wanderings through disenchanting environments. jazek, the main character, is compelled to struggle with an opponent stronger than himself: a town completely wrapped in profound indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his mute calls for help, while a faded photo of a little girl in a first communion dress goes on gnawing his soul. he's irremediably directing his steps towards a disconnected route to damnation seen through the deformations of the 18 mm. wide angle camera lens aiming at distorting every details, altering the reality, making it fade out in remote and alien echoes. kieslowski doesn't bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with honey-tongued tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant, differently from some hollywood stereotypes like "i want to live" (by robert wise). he doesn't slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to extenuate jazek's guilt and to mitigate the brutality of the crime, not interested at all in proximate psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial proceedings. in other words, in kieslowsky's opinion "a crime is always a crime": according to the principle of "par condicio" he puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man, using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most sinister light. and we can't remain indifferent: even if we don't agree with him, jazek's screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same manner that terri schiavo's entreating eyes do.

dekalog five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. three men are the focus of this chapter, and kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad (in one's case, almost overwhelmingly bad). with such vile characters, i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment. however, when the time comes for the murder (and it's subsequent effect on the murderer), kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view, "are you not as guilty as this man?" this sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of dekalog five that much more profound as kieslowski (as usual) doesn't stay within the literal confines of his theme. just as the other parts of the dekalog don't take their commandment's theme in it's literal sense, neither does dekalog five. it asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? it's a fantastic film and, typical of kieslowski, absolutely stunning.

nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. everything from acting to cinematography was solid. not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. definitely worth checking out. if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. though you may not feel like running out and buying it, i found it to be quite worth while.

i must admit i wasn't expecting much on this movie. i was surprised i truly enjoyed it as much as i did. the script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. the acting was great by mark wahlberg. jennifer aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. what made this movie for me was the music. if you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. its all about being a rockstar. some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all. i would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to stand up and shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.jason

i've been looking forward to the release of this movie since i first heard the concept two years ago, and i was not disappointed. i won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but i will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. the performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.my only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.(2) this is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. inxs' devil inside was from 1987 and ac/dc's are you ready was from 1990, among other mistakes. this bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. again, not a big deal.oh, i thought of something else that was strange. the steel dragon band members were supposed to be english, but for some reason dokken bassist jeff pilson and ozzy guitarist zakk wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in american accents. that was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so i will forgive that as well.i could probably nitpick all day, but i don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie. i will probably buy the dvd when it comes out, and i will certainly buy the soundtrack cd simply for the six steel dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band steelheart, if you remember them!). the highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where mark wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays "good vibrations" by marky mark and the funky bunch. the surprised look of mark's face is priceless. classic rock and roll flick! score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment

i liked this movie, not because tom selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face. i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.overall, it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the "dog day's" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away. a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "date" movie  trust me on that one! *wink*

i agree with the guy above, it is so funny i understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. go to japan and you will see a different movie after being there. when i met my girlfriends dad, at his home in kanagawa. i swear i felt the same as jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so i give this movie a 10 out 10.i have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to japan next month. one thing that is real good is the ball game scenes. makes me feel like i am there again. this is a must see if you have any interest in japan and baseball. too bad they don't make a sequel. does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it???? need to know so i can win an argumrnt with me japanese ex-wife. thanks

you have to have lived in japan for awhile to enjoy the beauty of this movie! i lived on okinawa for over 2 years, and northern honshu for 4. believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of contrasting east/west mentalities, both from a sports as well as personal relationships perspective. a funny, funny, and heartwarming movie that deserves better than americans viewing it can ever judge. 8+ out of 10!

it's out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia. apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), anderson's unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell......that's why i detest anna anderson and her confederates so much. not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson. life must have been hard for a young polish peasant worker in those days. and to impersonate another woman for 60+ years is an arduous task for anybody.she had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of anastasia's, and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem.anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track. had she put her good-looks, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills into proper use, she could of made a first-class actress.on a side note: some main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real figures. prince erich could be a mixture of gleb botkin(believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme), duke george and dmitri of leuchtenberg, and several other figures. and darya romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous princess xenia georgievna romanova. but unlike the real confederates, prince erich was motiveless in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her, which is touching.on the whole this is a great show. fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality. the power of amy irving's acting lies in that she successfully represented anderson's self-assuredness, the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. just as princess xenia said about anderson:"she was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part." highly recommended.

anastasia: the mystery of anna was a two-part star studded historical t.v. movie based on the peter kurth book, anastasia: the riddle of anna anderson. it keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. but sticks to the real story quite well. omar sharif and claire bloom do quite well as the russian royals, czar nicholas and czarina alexandra. what stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by rex harrison and olivia de havilland. all in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting. i was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on nbc in late 1986. also starring was the fine german actor jan niklas who had previously starred in nbc's other russian epic "peter the great". i felt that part 2 skipped over some important details of anna anderson's trip to america. it's important to know too, that in 1986 less was known about the anna anderson story. back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the grand duchess anastasia was genuine. by the late 1990's more was known and anna anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud. too bad the networks aren't making fine made-for-television movies like this anymore.

this movie is a very enjoyable homage to the bogart and other detective films of old. robert sacchi nails it as bogie and michelle phillips is a truly timeless beauty as gena anastas. however, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a hollywood film. one well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. the scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful middle eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing. the pulsating music, the swirling veils and ringing finger cymbals, free-flowing undulations and beautiful costumes - and a surprise twist involving the seductive sybil danning - build tension and excitement until the very end. the three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty kamala almanzar, one of the us' leading belly dancers since the mid-1970s. she was hand-picked by famed armenian musician guy chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road. guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene. if you watch the trailer on this site, you will see a glimpse of kamala (playing the finger cymbals behind sybil danning). if you're not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will be after watching this movie, and if you're an aficionado, it holds up very well after repeated viewing.

making this short and to the point. this movie was great! i loved it! i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for 3 bucks on vhs and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks. i'm a big bogart fan and i just latched onto this movie. i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone. robert sacchi is great and pulls off a good bogart. his nose is a little big, his voice is a bogart-columbo mix, and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise, he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. no one can be a perfect bogart but he was great. remember, sam marlow is a fan of bogart and isn't going to do everything he did. he mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real bogart's character's. but, it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. watch it and have fun!

sacchi is the best bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as sam marlowe. the music from award winning composer george duning [from here to eternity, picnic, the world of suzie wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous ambassador hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director robert day [kojak, streets of san francisco, the avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. see this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.

this amusing, sometimes poignant look at the hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars robert sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, humphrey bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name "sam marlowe". robert sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there. for awhile, "sam"'s only client is his landlady, who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend, and his only conversational foil is his secretary, simply called "dutchess" (misty rowe), who in his own words, "looked like marilyn monroe and made about as much sense as gracie allen", and has a passion for banana splits. then he encounters elsa (olivia hussey), the plain, sweet, virginal daughter of a retired props-master who has been murdered for no discernible reason. in the process of investigating the murder, sam shortly runs across: the gene tierney lookalike daughter (michelle phillips) of anastas, an avaricious, obscenely wealthy greek shipping tycoon (victor buono, turning in a creditable sidney greenstreet), his hapless, long-suffering second wife (yvonne decarlo, who manages to play a variety of put-upon emotions without saying a word), his two smarmy henchmen (herbert lom, channelling peter lorre, and jay robinson, doing a reasonably accurate lionel atwill), and anastas' vicious, amoral middle-eastern potentate (franco nero) who comes complete with a glamorus and bafflingly loyal mistress (sybil danning), all of whom would give anything to acquire the "eyes of alexander", two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. when elsa is murdered, marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal, and he sets out through a labyrinth of los angeles landmarks, including the hollywood bowl, the scatological and esoteric attractions of hollywood boulevard, and santa catalina island in pursuit of the rocks, determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy competitors. throw in cameos by mike mazurki and assorted others, the traditional dumb-but-sympathetic ally on the police force, and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players, and despite an unfortunate title song, you have, to my mind, a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.

even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. alright, more than a little... my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.don't watch this movie expecting another darko. darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. donnie darko is a thing of the past, get over it.richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it. the deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address.summary: creepy old man tells cammeron diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. to spare my fingers the typing... for pushing the button, diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race.i liked: the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. its different. its intense. it has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy 101 material). it leaves you guessing. not a hollywood ending!i disliked: why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? what god like alien has the patience for that? diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? they live in virginia. i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies. overall good flick.

lackawanna blues is an entertaining, engrossing, emotionally-charged hbo-tv movie based on the childhood memories of actor ruben santiago-hudson (who also appears in a small role). this joyous motion picture experience is centered around santiago-hudson's childhood guardian, rachel "nanny" crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate new york during the 1950's. nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks, derelicts, cripples, drug addicts, misfits, and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. the crux of the story revolves around nanny's relationship with young ruben (beautifully played by marcus franklin),a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so nanny took him in. s. epatha merkeson, who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of lieutenant van buren on nbc's law & order, turns in a powerhouse performance as nanny, the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town. merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned her a golden globe and an emmy award. merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes terrance howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as nanny's husband), louis gossett jr., rosie perez, jimmy smits, delroy lindo, macy gray, michael k. williams, jeffrey wright, henry simmons, patricia wettig, ernie hudson, mos def, and hill harper as the adult ruben. colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored, this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by s. epatha merkeson, who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it.

this is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. i'll go so far as to put it up there with ray and the aviator. it is the story of a young, bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing miss rachael aka "nanny". you will fall in love with nanny, a woman who gives all of herself to those around her. s. epatha merkerson brings the character to life beautifully, and the other cast members are do the same. if i were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles, i'd have to mention everyone in the entire cast. the music in this film perfectly blends with the story, almost dictates the way it goes. and what's more, this film is actually entertaining. it won't bore you at all, not even for a minute! i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart, very entertaining, quality film.

two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making. the director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography, and very creative artistry.the relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details, and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into. the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war.the acting was great, particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by jonathan furr), to the older brother (played by ben allison) and the powerful perfomrance by the colonel (played by ron perlman). the performance was extremely well cast.it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers, and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages.

pierre jolivet plays a don quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. he trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. just as don quixote rode rocicante, "the man" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world. both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the story.unlike cervantes's tale, in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. we can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in. our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers. our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph, to vanquish, to change his world (for the better) back into a world of plenty that no longer exists.we look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans-as-animals. don quixote considered himself a true knight among animals.with cervantes's tale we can only see the dreamer, without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement. in besson's and jolivet's tale we see the new world from the eyes of don quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character.

remember that this came out before gulf war i, which gave us werner herzog's "lessons of darkness".le dernier combat is not "sci fi". it's more like judgment. i've watched it at least a dozen times. it really is a fitting companion to herzog's "lessons of darkness": "and in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them."that someday, alas, may be today, in iraq. but, back to le dernier combat, make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film. i wouldn't call it a "surprise ending", but it is something you'll miss if you just assume the end won't be anything more than what you will already have seen.

gerald (richard carlson) and kitty (veronica hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in france with family and friends, when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in scotland. gerald's uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested gerald, the sole heir, be present. gerald goes off to scotland, leaving his future bride behind. a few weeks pass and he doesn't come back. concerned, kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fiancé. four more weeks pass and kitty finally receives a weird response from gerald, calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers, kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay gerald a visit. accompanying her on the trip is her level-headed aunt edith (katherine emery, best known for her starring role in the classic chiller isle of the dead). when kitty and edith arrive at the macteam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. for starters gerald seems to have aged twenty-years in a matter of weeks. secondly, this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. when edith comes down with a mild cold, kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things.why is gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? why is gerald so opposed to having company? why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate, such as gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? and what's making those strange dragging noises every night? these are just some of the questions the maze poses. the movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. you genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. and then it happens... i definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-droppingly strange turns i've seen in any movie. it's wonderfully ludicrous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b/w mystery and sends it straight into z-grade schlock territory. and yet, this ending seems so out of place, you're not likely to forget it once you see it.despite the ending (or maybe even partially because of the ending), i really enjoyed this odd bird. it's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. director william cameron menzies (who made the much more famous invaders from mars the same year) is best known as a two-time oscar-winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting. there's almost a silent movie feel at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. as with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. this one also throws in a few rubber-bats-on-strings for good measure.a few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward, but i liked most of the cast. hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. emery, who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. my favorite however was michael pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs. also on board in smaller roles are hillary brooke (who played the title role in the sherlock holmes mystery the woman in green) and lilian bond (whale's the old dark house). of course carlson also starred in it came from outer space, creature from the black lagoon and some other horror flicks, so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. i say check it out!

i recently saw this film at a 3-d film festival in hollywood. it was in polarized 3-d (gray glasses not red & blue) it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3-d perfect. the performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (that we aren't supposed to share with fellow movie go'ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. by today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-d (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film was an entertaining romp into 50's horror.

is this a good movie? it's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when "the old gentleman" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.yes, what lurks in the maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. but the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact. not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie, of course.but working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers -- and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented -- creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling. at times, of course, the movie is very silly, but it has its moments.

a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her evasive fiancé. this is a much-maligned film because of its denouement, but up to that point, it's interesting, well-acted, eerie, and with fine set design (by william cameron menzies, developed for 3-d projection). veronica hurst is captivating and genteel, sort of a chic british marilyn monroe, still in love with richard carlson, who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle; there are even bats in the belfry! it moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece, when hurst and her aunt (katherine emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center. as a kid, i always remembered this sequence - there's nothing scarier (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10-foot high maze of hedges. naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. the final result is mildly disappointing really, since carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings-on, even provoking sympathy. worth seeing.

i remember this film of old. it's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. and there are even stranger events taking place out back, in hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "the shining." but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. i certainly didn't see it coming. this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy, bordering on laughable. i'd recommend it to anyone.

i liked it better than house party 2 & 3. the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. chris stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman; look for his mom who plays the lead character, john john's grandmother. and you can hear her rap the title song "down to the last minute" at the end of the film as the credits roll. she's very funny and a really good actress, as well. the young actors who star in it (the main trio), and who in reality are part of the music group imx, did a superb job. before this film i had not paid much attention to this r & b group. now i'm a fan. the music number in the house party scene alone is worth checking out the movie. i was pleasantly surprised. i loved it.

the main reason i loved this movie is because imx (formerly immature) were in it. they were in house party 3 when they were 11, but they are all grown up now! i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore. i think chris stokes did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.

here in germany it was only shown on tv one time. today, as everything becomes mainstream, it's absolute impossible, to watch a film like this again on the screen. maybe it's the same in usa, or especially gb. the message is a brutal truth : find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality, or you become a loser, if not an asshole instead.the whole film is not particularly as simple, as it may seem here. every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen, when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd, which calls itself normal.very well played by all this is a must seen. who is the main character? john (not cox, folks, remember ;-) ore niles (who still is bimbo) decide and you will get the plot as it is intended.a bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system. kind of salingers catcher in the rye and goldings lord of the flies thought to the very end.the final maybe change your own mind. word

s. epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago, jr. (marcus franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of nanny. the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def, macy gray, terrence dashon howard, rosie perez, louis gossett, jr., liev schreiber, jimmy smits, ernie hudson, delroy lindo, and patricia wettig. loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end, and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. but, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson.

ever since i first encountered the divine ms merkerson as a sex therapist in spike lee's "she's gotta have it" i have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. she received an emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.here she simply shines as the guiding force and hand in her community. this was especially poignant for me for i grew up in this very same time period. the production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like ms merkerson portrayed. she was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot, hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again. i first saw macy gray's name in the credits and went ho-hum. her performance was so good, i didn't even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through. i am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in african-american culture that is very tastefully done.another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices.this is a worthy, elegant presentation of african-american life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic. you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection.i highly recommend.

i had the chance to watch blind spot in barcelona and i enjoyed it tremendously. i thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that i'd seen for a long time. one of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. the three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. they are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the dop's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time. the mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of los angeles or san francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. the story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter-sweet ending, being the perfect climax for this perfect journey. the construction of the film itself is a master craft. the skilled use of innovative resources (like stills stitching danny's memories into the film) will compare to those hand-made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable. blind spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native.

"blind spot" one of my festival favorites. i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. the cast is great. james franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from los angeles. his journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. the film has a powerful style. it pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. it also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love. there is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension. strange. suspenseful. beautiful to look at. definitely worth seeing. i really would like to see it again. periodically i check to see if blind spot has been distributed. i can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvd.davide pepe 13/08/2005 bologna - italy

films belonging to the "film noir" genre usually contain similar elements: a "deus ex machina" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. think "high sierra" or "white heat."there is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. but when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.it is this latter tradition that "blind spot" belongs to. the film follows danny alton, a troubled teenager (superbly played with depth, grace, emotional integrity and downright plaintiveness by james franco, who throws himself completely into this role) who has fallen in love with the rough-edged streetkid, darcy.from the beginning, you know this is going to be bad.darcy invites danny to his house. but the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. danny is robbed of his clothing and possessions, but uses the check to track down the suicidal april -- darcy's other lover. when they reach darcy's real home, they find wayne -- a thug hunting darcy down for the money he's stolen. together, the three manage to locate darcy in a dusty, run-down motel in the desert. but that's only the beginning of the tale, as plastic explosives, drugs, gun-running, a creepy funeral home, bisexual assassins and a lonely half-finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley outside a tattoo parlor in los angeles.this film contains some of the best noir cinematography i have seen in years. in one scene, danny races on foot through the desert to the half-finished house in the desert where he believes darcy may have been taken that evening by mobsters. a very long shot with sharp lighting effects shows danny -- arms and legs flailing, palpable fear etched on his face (visible even at this distance), dust cloud trailing behind him as the wind whips in his direction -- racing across the desert flats toward the house. the loneliness, the desperation, the despair danny feels is shocking depicted. there are many such scenes in this film, wonderfully crafted by the experienced maximo munzi. this is oscar-winning material.the editing, too, is just astounding. the film contains little moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. bits of time, where memory and feeling come flooding back. at these times, quick montages of images flash across the screen. this is superb editing by director-writer-editor stephan woloszczuk. in one early montage, danny describes the wondrous feelings he has now that darcy has entered his life. quick images of danny's diary flash across the screen: the words "4 life," "lucky" and "safe" stop momentarily, while page upon page of words, the contents of a human heart, race across the screen -- out of focus, too quick to read. it's like the flood of emotion danny himself feels.the flood of images reveals something else about this film: just how beautiful nathaniel waters' production design is. darcy's quonset-hut home is the perfect match of high-tech and slob (a tribute to the attentiveness of set decorator kimberly foster). the stunning desert house scene is just outright creepy. the ruined motel where darcy hides out can be found in any abandoned small town in america. the creepy (and astoundingly lit) funeral home where the plot takes a horrific turn mixes starkness with the pall of death hanging over the entire film. (it's too bad the film's lighting director is not credited.) this film has a superb production design, one that enhances every single frame and every actor's performance.that's the fourth element of this film which makes it grab you and hold on to you: the acting. james franco is a superb actor. even in "spider-man" -- where he was given practically nothing to do -- franco showed that he understands human emotion like no other actor of his generation. he's no pretty-boy coasting on his good looks like brad pitt. franco portrays deep emotion with full force. his performances contain pure human heart. consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home, where danny collapses after telling april and wayne that darcy is dead. lesser actors couldn't carry off the complete emotional breakdown of a human being. franco does.shawn montgomery, in her first film, simply blows you away with her performance as the suicidal april. deeply in love with darcy, suffering from massive depression after having to bury alone her unborn child (after the fetus spontaneously aborts) in a perfume box in the woods, her life of luxury and perfection now a shambles: april is one of the best-drawn characters on film that i have ever seen. while danny's relationship to darcy is slowly teased out during the film, april's nervous breakdown is revealed only to the audience. neither danny nor wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being. april's despair when she realizes danny has also been darcy's lover is poignant and potent, even if it is truncated by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for very long now. montgomery brings to april a pathos that puts your heart through the wringer.mark patrick gleason is given the hardest job in the film: having to make something human and real out of the thug, wayne. at first, wayne is simply one of any number of violent, foul-mouthed, obsessed drug-pushers/gun-runners that appears in any number of films (from "kindergarten cop" to "beverly hills cop 2"). gleason does very well with what he's given, but he doesn't quite get to where you feel much for wayne. it's difficult to say whether this is gleason's problem or the material's. there is one moment -- where wayne (who is darcy's brother, although neither danny nor april know this) reads danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between the two men -- where you just know that wayne is going to go homophobic on danny's ass. but the explosion never comes. (thank god! trite plots are death to film noir.) once the revelation about the siblings comes at the film's end, the audience is fairly astounded to realize the depth of love and compassion wayne truly felt for darcy -- so deep that wayne accepted danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. but this all happens off-screen. gleason is never given a chance to act out wayne's feelings. it must have been very frustrating for the performer.the story is rather inventive, although the smuggling device seen at the end of the film is likely to remind viewers of "diamonds are forever" (yes, james bond). a traditional narrative voice-over (which proves franco is as great a voice talent as he is a physical actor) provides terrific atmosphere, although it does tend to flow over into schmaltz a few times toward the end of the film (providing some unintentional laughter). terrific locales play key visual roles in the film. kudos to the location scout for finding such astounding buildings! the end of the film struck me as a bit rushed; not pat, but a little too firm for my film noir tastes.now, i've seen audiences either hate or love "blind spot." modern film audiences, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir. my suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair, emotional collapse, desperation or depression as laughable. take them to a small theater, where they can glory in the spectacle of the film's vision, but where their viewing won't be ruined by a crowd of people who won't recognize good film noir. get them some popcorn (trust me, they'll be so engrossed they won't finish it), get them a soda, and let them be overwhelmed. go some place bright and cheery afterward, to wash the grime and awfullness out of your soul. because this film is so good at making you feel, you'll need that restorative.

i don't think i've yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college, just to impress his parents. nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels, or plots that have been used in many different films. this one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal. with this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. now i've seen better, but upon going into the theater i was thinking another drug/beer/frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in (aka an "american pie" flick) but i was surprised. to sum it up, i enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies, look for show times to "accepted". if you want to laugh out loud, that is.

this movie turned out to be better than i had expected it to be. some parts were pretty funny. it was nice to have a movie with a new plot.

i just wanted to say that. i love gheorghe muresan, so i automatically loved this movie. everything else about it was so-so... billy crystal is a good actor, even if he is annoying. but the thing that made this movie was- at least, for a basketball fan- seeing gheorghe muresan act.

lackawana blues an impressive hbo movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several characters.touching,alive,entrancing-a great mix of sound and story- based on a true story featuring an all-star cast.a time capsule about .....you get the point and no i am not on the payola for the hbo crew- i would throw around more superlatives but i am about to go out . the extras on the dvd include a deleted scene,a featurette and commentary.the funniest part about the featurette was "star" lighting they used when interviewing exec producer halle berry..ok seriously - good times a

what a wonderful film, filled with eccentric, unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. the director also did a great job keeping the story held together, getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. s. epatha in the lead role is great. i had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although i have enjoyed her on law and order, this really shows what she can do with a filled out, complex role. macy gray is terrific, mos def, as usual, wonderful. lou gossett, great. jimmy smits, terrific, and doesn't try to pull focus because he's a star. a true piece of ensemble acting. rent it, enjoy it, groove to it, and treasure it. something special.

i have to admit i had never heard of this movie. i caught it last night on tmc. i thought it was hysterical. i laughed so hard and loved the ending. image what a marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with salvadore dali and malcolmn x and then all dropped lsd.funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 iq points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. i had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. i over slept and missed my obligations. still worth it. i would not recommend renting it, i would recommend owning it. it was that good.the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people. bare with it and use your head.i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time.

sure, the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time. in that sense, the movie has indeed dated. but as a satirical look at america's number one parasitical industry, advertising, it's still on target. but just as important is the counter- message, namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially responsibleno promoting war toys, alcohol, etc. thus, the movie's also about the allures of capitalism. note, for example, how putney's garb suddenly changes to resemble third-world revolutionary fidel's, just before he pulls out of the firm. for a moment, it looks like swope's mini-revolution has succeeded among his staff, and he's moving on, maybe to spread the movement. but then, the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head, perhaps to hijack a plane to cuba. downey's final word, however, is an ironical one as the arab (i believe) burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of (advertising, capitalism) a smoking ruin. to me, this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reforma message consistent with the radical spirit of the time.whatever the subtext, there are some genuinely funny moments, especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then. those who compare the anarchic style to that of the marx bros. make a good point. the throw-away lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous set-ups. forty years later, it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on. despite the crudities, however, the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments.

"putney swope" is a unique, low low low budget gem from the late 1960's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things: paul thomas anderson (who named don cheadle's character in "boogie nights", buck swope, after the eponymous hero of this film) and the limited dvd release. watching "putney swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make a lot of sense (at least to me it didn't upon watching it for the first time), but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message. i didn't understand a lot of things about "putney swope", but for the most part, i liked it. the more i think about the movie, the more it grows on me.the film is advertised as a parody of new york's madison avenue, best known in the 1960's as the advertising capital of the world. members of generation x and y may be lost on this concept, but fortunately "mad men" is on tv to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of u.s. history. what you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male, and even more largely white establishments.with this premise in mind, the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting. the members are predominantly white except for putney swope (arnold johnson, who bears an uncanny resemblance to dick gregory in this film), the token african-american on the board. the board members are so self-absorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them, their only concern is who will become chairman next. without even removing the body from the boardroom, they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman.putney swope is elected by a landslide, but not because the other members think swope is qualified. voting for swope was an ill-fated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member's chance of being elected chairman. with their plans backfired, swope takes charge and "sink(s) the boat", firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place .after this point, the film became (for me) very weird and hard to follow plot-wise. there may not have even been a plot, really. the whole idea of the film seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result being that the new "truth and soul inc." firm would be unconventional, but successful nonetheless. the firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes. it could be because swope doesn't trust banks, although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film. it could also be metaphoric in some way, but who knows.most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency, with occasional scenes in the white house with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a midget. my assumption is here that some political joke was being made, but i can't figure out what. were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small, insignificant part of american life? were they saying that the latest elected officials (nixon at the time) were insignificant candidates? i don't know. i found it a bit eerie, however, that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president ronald reagan. it is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made.what this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads. of course, the ad footage possessed a strange, funny appeal for its unconventional creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? if so, how? the movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the white house. however, it would have been revealing to see average people, since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers.although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn't stand the test of time, this film still had a lot of unique qualities. arnold johnson had a magnetic x factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film. swope's rough voice was actually director robert downey, sr.'s voice dubbed in, sometimes poorly, but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider. he hires and fires workers at random, but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the ad agency and seeking out new ideas.the premise of the film was, and still is, incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (robert downey, sr.). however, this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. although some of the sex scenes may be a bit off-putting for some viewers, the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking. many people may not take a positive message away from this movie, but i just did."putney swope" remains an overlooked movie from a strange era, and downey, sr. (even despite his son's recent comeback) never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved. however, if you find a dvd of this movie, buy it and watch it. if it's on netflix, ditto. it's a movie that can be confusing at times, but is worth watching for its gusto, ambition, and its non-conformist stature even by today's movie standards.

odd but wonderfully original movie. genuinely frightening, creepy and ridiculous in equal measures. the setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. the thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills. the cast is fantastic. tanya dempsey really gets to chew some scenery after being undervalued in other full moon films. joe estevez proves why brother martin sheen is so much bigger in hollywood - his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious. charles band co-produced with stuart gordon and this really is an exceptional full moon/darkwave release. danny draven also directed hell asylum with dempsey.

i guess by the time i saw this episode, i had seen enough twilight zones to have it figured out ahead of time. there is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. they are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. it is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. there is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts, but no one can remember anything. they represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. why are they there? it leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end, but i guess i had a pretty good idea before it all happened.

during the sci-fi tz marathon of january 31, 1999, this episode was the last one aired in the 20th century in my time zone(eastern). it was new year's eve, and when the clown starts singing, "we're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here..." i realized that this was tz's clever nod to it being new year's eve because that tune is also the tune to old lang syne. coincidence? we will never know.i love this story for the little touches: the tear on the ballerina, the antics of the clown, and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. this and the art carney santa tz are the only ones that are about christmas. my personal top five episodes, after five characters...: 1. the hunt 2. the after hours 3. the hitchhiker 4. the lonely 5. little girl lost

it seems there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think that "five characters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the "lame" twist at the end (which apparently, in their small minds, is the only reason the twilight zone exists: to come up with twists).there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i'm not one to rate all tz episodes ten. but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating. it is claustrophobic and colorful. the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end. but whatever that secret is, what these people are, it doesn't really matter. most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that. it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are.

this is one of the classic twilight zone episodes, where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. five figures are inside a container/prison: a major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. they are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. what have they in common? none can figure it out. but gradually the major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders. and the major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... i'll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.the title seems to be suggested by six characters in search of an author, pirandello's famous play. whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. but the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in pirandello who know their current situations. this uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.the actors, william windon as the major and murray mattheson as the clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. and the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.

this is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007.the tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told.beautifully shot, and scripted - from childhood to the adulthood it never falters.a brilliant insight into a lost culture, and a very good way to understand farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right. it is both compassionate and thrilling, uplifting and filled with immense sorrow, joyful and depressing.with excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best.highest recommendation: a real slice of life that uplifts and informs.

i really enjoyed this movie. i have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye', and this movie delivers that in spades. glenn ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about selling'. when the ranch hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands. but, that's just what he is about to do. i knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy (richard jaeckel, one of my very favorite bad-guy character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialog with him, glenn ford slaps his face and shoots him dead. kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. in short order we're treated to ford letting his ranch be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch; then ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. talk about getting even big-time. lots of action in this movie. there's more to the story than this, but i'll just recommend you watch the movie. glenn ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and i really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way.

john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the wilkison's over at anchor. the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers, he has a change of heart, particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse.originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration, chiefly because of the cast that was involved. when you got edward g. robinson, glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie, you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel. sadly they don't get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits, or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice?. well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture. i think yes it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from, it is, when all is said and done, a plot that has been milked for all it's worth, and then some. but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production.glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an eskimo's nose throughout, and it's always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because she's good at it. while eddie g, when one gets used to him being in a western, is fine in what is an under written part. robinson, who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee wilkison, broderick crawford got injured, is the one who is short changed the most by the makers, even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock {a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel} and judith wilkison {a radiant dianne foster} get something to leave an impression with. but for what it is, robinson's crutch toting "bad" guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons.not shy on action and gun play, it's with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph maté's film rises above the mundane, with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett guffey's stunning cinematography. lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture {see seven men from now for another glorious use of it}, but here guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn. the violent men isn't a great western picture, and perhaps a better director than maté could have really given donald hamilton's {the big country} novel an adaptation to be proud of. but for every niggle and irk i personally had with it, i found two more reasons to actually really like it, so that it be, it's recommended, for sure. 7/10

stanwyck at her villainous best, robinson her equal - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western.some good action scenes, strong use of location, colour and cinemascope. but why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene?ford is dependable as always and foster is strong as robinson's daughter, but it is the baddies' film. and it's not just stanwyck and robinson - brian keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as stanwyck's lover, and richard jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer.see it for the camp value.

extremely entertaining mid-1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a 96-minute running time. most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable. more than just a b-western but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names. glenn ford was the only box office draw at the time. edward g. robinson and barbara stanwyck were past their primes and looking for work, stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "the big valley". brian keith and dianne foster were just starting out.ford plays john parrish, a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big rancher's (robinson) hired gunman. parrish is a former confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons. robinson plays lee wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, making good on a promise to his wife martha (stanwyck). lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier; his brother cole (keith) has come up from texas to help him run the huge spread. lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious hookups between stanwyck and keith but sensitive daughter judith (foster) is understandably upset by what is going on in their home. john parrish has promised his fiancée caroline (may winn) that he will move back east. caroline, who is modeled on grace kelly's "high noon" character, breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film. this leaves the way open for a john and judith romance to develop. the violence starts early and continues throughout the film, with parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. he has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film. ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self- deprecating manner, who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked (very much like his role in "the sheepman"). robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self. and he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character. stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-faced woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother. in part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character. that said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations.dianne foster is a pleasant surprise. she should remind viewers a lot of carroll baker, both physically and in acting style. although required to play judith according to 1950's convention (she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation), foster shows a nice range. she conveys a growing attraction for parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place. the real problem with "the violent men" is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play. because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment. this is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like caroline.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

the violent men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast.edward g. robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is glenn ford. ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance (may wynn) until robinson's ambitious brother (brian keith) murders one of ford's hands. then you know what happens next.barbara stanwyck is along as robinson's scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. dianne foster plays their daughter who comes to admire ford.the violent men is nothing more than a "b" plot with an "a" movie cast but it is very well done.

a western through and through. as the title character portrayed by glenn ford says, "no, i don't want to fight, but i will if it's forced on me." this movie is about being intelligent, strong, and fighting for one's beliefs. with courage, never stop striving for what you feel is right. great action and mostly quick paced. good to see brian keith in this role and edward g. robinson as an older western man. glenn ford lives up to his western image. thoroughly enjoyable film includes strategic non-military warfare. of course it's violent, like the title states, but not too graphic like in the computer-generated era films. it's mostly about strong personality clashes.

i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me. i was bored, i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself! i've watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like it.i thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true. i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship. i thought they all did an excellent job. the ending was good.and you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. which is what a movie is supposed to be like.

hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message. it seemed like that this film was for young children, but i know that adults will like this film. the storyline is pretty simple. a kid who moved to florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing owls from construction of a pancake house. the message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers. the message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals. the acting in this film is decent. all the three kids looked like they had good chemistry. the music is not too shabby. i liked jimmy buffet's songs in this film. overall this is a good family film. i rate this film a 9/10.

saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids. a bit predictable. the book was better, gave more plot details, ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy. i think hiassen's warped humor comes across better in the book than the movie, but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well. it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age. loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher. and those baby owls were adorable. i wonder how they managed to film them. the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best, made it look very appealing. am i imagining it, or did the author carl hiassen make a brief appearance?

hoot was terrific. the owls are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue i didn't know existed. florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. my kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. it's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. when kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values, and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it. i think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. it was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. anyway, overall it was really a great time and i'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful.

i must confess, i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it. i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone. therefore, i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad. then, today, i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it. the speed that events were occurring was questionable, it could have been a little longer. i found it was very true to the book, however it left out some crucial parts: mullet finger's real name, etc. i felt as if i hadn't read the book i wouldn't have really understand what was going on. the acting was quite good, another thing i had expected to be poor, however the cop, sorry i can't remember the actor's name, could have done a little better. all in all, i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences!

in "hoot", mullet fingers is engaging in sabotage to stop the pancake house. the problem is that the builders just start over again, and he has to take more drastic measures. when he is confronted with the dogs, he scares them off with snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital.roy at bedtime asks his father, who works with the department of justice, how he deals with crooks. his father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers, because sooner or later, they all slip up. you can see this with enron and worldcom. roy looks at documents relating to the pancake house, and finds a suppressed document (he does have to break in to the company trailer), so when the police see it, he has the law on his side. unlike when he evaded the police.mind you, as mentioned before, roy is not always law-abiding, and when the company man is killing owls (illegally), mullet fingers takes direct action. he can't wait for the law (mullet fingers is in hiding). the movie does suggest that one should work in the system.

this is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately pigeon-holed as "just for kids." the plot revolves around a young man, roy eberhardt, newly arrived in southwest florida from the montana mountains. trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school, roy discovers a brother-sister team trying to protect endangered burrowing owls at an illegal construction site. look for carl hiassen, the author of the book upon which this movie is based, as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate headquarters. writer/director wil shriner is also the clerk at the public records office where the intrepid teen-detectives discover that the incriminating environmental impact report is missing. luke wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines. wilson is the bumbling police officer, in his three-wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren. as officer dave, he tries so hard to do well, but usually ends up falling in the muck, literally! several times! jimmy buffet is pretty low key as the tacitly supportive science teacher. but, young actors logan lerman (roy), brie larson (beatrice the bear), and cody linley (mullet fingers) are superb as the teens who finally put officer dave on the right track, following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss. i hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as i did. just plain fun! one small complaint, though. i hope all non-floridians realize that not everyone from florida is as surly to newcomers as depicted in this film. we're really a friendly bunch! just ask carl hiassen and jimmy buffet!!

i highly recommend this movie to everyone. my son and i read the book first and then saw the movie. while the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still great. my son and i agree that while we like the book version the best, we liked the ending of the movie better than the book ending. the scenery is just tremendous and the soundtrack is a must have. the fact that jimmy buffett has a small role and provides music is an added plus. luke wilson does a decent job in his role of officer delinko and is pretty much what i had mentally imagined delinko would look like when i read the book. i'm surprised that this didn't do better in the theaters, and i'll be waiting for the dvd to come out.

the film is about the battle of stalingrad. for those of you who don't know anything about it, it was the worst battle in the second world war. over 1 million people died in the course of the battle. this is the only film that i've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between russia and germany. what i really liked about it is that the two ideologies (nazism and communism) were nowhere in the film. unlike most american films, the germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers, but what the average german foot soldier was, a person.the film revolves around four soldiers fighting in stalingrad. they were transferred there to try and take the city. the film follows these men from august of 1942 to early 1943. during this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle.through the entire film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. unlike "enemy at the gates" the film makers didn't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle. this film may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in world war ii.

most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. viewers under "a certain age" and with iq's of three digits should avoid "chance of a lifetime" like a george w.bush appointee facing a congressional grilling.the cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well-written script. is the premise wildly original? no, but the movie stands out like a lighthouse at midnight in the current and non-ending glut of movies/tv geared to the most-desirable audience demographic of teenagers and "young adults"in addition to betty white and leslie neilsen in the leads, the cast also has ever-reliable veterans like elaine stritch and william windom. the sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros."chance of a lifetime" is definitely not a movie for the will ferrell/adam sandler/"saw" slasher gore-fests, "american eye dull," and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge ground out by hollywood and tv.

this is one of my favorites. betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. one is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. the other is a playboy who has tired of gold-digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital, mature woman. if you've got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treat.

my husband dragged me to this film as i had no interest in seeing some anime cartoon. i was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation. in a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous, imaginative hand drawn animation. the world of sosuke and ponyo is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality. i haven't seen animation like this since i was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed.the actors supplying the voices in the english version were fabulous. the length of the movie was perfect, especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films. overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays.

few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.(no. too many are focused on john lassiter's "amazing" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. still, miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.that said, i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the "star power" of frankie jonas and noah cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew aaron) who's review was "of course it was good! everything miyazaki-san does is good!," a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and i'm betting the older charas too) and loving the "cuteness" of the child characters.and that is what i respect most about miyazaki-san. he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. on the surface, "ponyo" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names soske (somewhat like "the little mermaid"), but there is an entire different level at play here. true to form, miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother, soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself. once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. once human, she teams up with her friend, soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human. frankie jonas (yes. he's related to the jonas brothers. can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young soske (which is good since he has the most lines). his character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific.in the end, ponyo's father, fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. he hopes that ponyo and soske will "remember him fondly." and once again, miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical "bad guy." although miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. no one in real life is completely a "bad person." all humans are various shades of gray. and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters. and then there's the animation itself. in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever. certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and i, for one, was extremely grateful for that. the character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. this is what animation used to look like- and what it should look like. in the end, i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. certainly not miyazaki's best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the entire family.

hayao miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe, and his most recent cinematic work of art is "ponyo," a children's fairytale borrowing on story elements from the little mermaid. of course like other miyazaki classics such as "spirited away" and his last film, "howl's moving castle," "ponyo" is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults, but this it is distinctly more a children's story than those recent efforts. it's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm instead of conflict."ponyo" is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an undersea sorcerer, who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl. when she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named sosuke. in the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff-top town where sosuke lives with his mother, and it threatens to end the world.like "howl's moving castle," walt disney picked up "ponyo" for an american release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of western voices, even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of disney band the jonas brothers (frankie jonas) and miley cyrus (younger sister noah) to voice sosuke and ponyo, respectively. also voicing characters are liam neeson (fujimoto, ponyo's father), tina fey (lisa, sosuke's mother), matt damon (sosuke's father), cate blanchett (ponyo's sea goddess mother) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by betty white, cloris leachman and lily tomlin. the effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to american audiences and disney is getting close.but voices are of little significance in a miyazaki film, which is all about visual creativity. a fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion, creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must've been a joy for miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story. among the highlights are droplets of water that fujimoto sends after ponyo that move like living waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make "ponyo" as awing as any other miyazaki film.as a children's story, however, "ponyo" concentrates its efforts on being adorable. the discovery of true friendship and love between sosuke and ponyo is heart-warming, even if noah cyrus shouting childishly when ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying. but as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are, there's very little antagonism or danger. past miyazaki films have clear villains, but the conflict in "ponyo" actually shrinks as the story goes along. sosuke believes he's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but "ponyo" is mostly tension free. most glaringly, its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are."ponyo" will surely satisfy miyazaki's fans in every way with its imagination, and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling, but this is distinctly more of a children's movie, best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience. it's not quite what you'd expect from miyazaki considering his recent work, but it's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~steven cvisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com

this film was great! i love the way it mixes dark humor with drama. there are times when you think there is no possible way you could laugh at the situation presented, and yet you experience a surprising giggle. it is wonderfully acted, with great performances by sigourney weaver, jeff daniels, and emile hirsch. it is well written with a stylish, surprising ending. i'm not one to say that everyone will like it as much as i did, but give it a chance and rent it. the dvd has great special features, including full-length commentaries by director, dan harris and emile hirsch and one by sigourney weaver, that give you interesting information about the film. i hope my comment is helpful, and that you enjoy the movie!

some may think imaginary heroes is a movie exactly like "igby goes down" but it isn't. in imaginary heroes, the director lets us feel for the travis family and the people around them.the movie itself is great, and the acting is extremely well done. weaver's and hirsch's acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is. the actors, director/writer, dan harris, has made a movie that many people should see. don't think this is just another teen movie, it is a movie about a family and their problems.i gave this movie a 10/10 because i believe it isn't the best film, which no film can be, but its the closest it can get to perfect.

great characters, great acting, great dialogue, incredible plot twists in plain language one of the best shows i've ever seen in my life. do yourself a favor and watch this show, you won't regret it. this show re-writes the book on sci-fi!

faqrscape is truly one of those shows that just has it all, great acting,great cast,great writing,sets,chemistry,muppets...it's got it all and then some, except a home. this fantastic series it's seem has it all except and ending. tptb seem to think this is a series that is consecutive single set shows, when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing ,one epic, love story, that has an end that must been seen. if you have never watched farscape do youself a favor and check it out on dvd when the season 1 will be released in october....and season 2 is the best there is! watch the reruns on the scifi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in january through march when most shows are going in to hiatis and be sure to watch. if all goes well we will get our ending!

farscape totally rules! in my opinion it's very close to babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series (spaceship included). the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship.what i really love and appreciate in farscpae is,that they don't use cgi for the alien characters or if they do, it's unnoticeable. they use those lovable, crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star wars.farscape is something you definitely want to look into, if you already haven't.

ladies and gentlemen: the show begins with this documentary film. it's structured in three chapters, each one chronologically arranged. the first presents the classical physics and links to einstein. the second studies in depth the quantum physics and enters in string theory. the last reveals the everything theory... the difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way, with daily objects; although you must believe them without checking by yourself -if you are not a scientist- (and even if you are a scientist!!). the film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique or the way it's produced; what really imports is the story, and what a story!!!

many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a physics course - i know i didn't. but after watching this program, i surely wish i had.this documentary is a guide to the 'holy grail of physics' - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one 'master equation' that eluded einstein during the last years of his life. brian green, a professor at columbia university, introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in.we start with the tantalizing possibility of a 'master equation' that could unite and explain everything... *everything!* in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity. green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of newton, then einstein, and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level.but it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and one that no one has been able to solve just yet. how can we unify all these forces that we know together? we find, as green constantly points out throughout the problem - that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings. however, if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very big price to pay.it turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory, that, as a consequence, we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with, not just 3 dimensions that you and i see every day plus 1 (for time), but rather, that we may actually live in a universe of *11* dimensions. but the math that arises out of that theory doesn't stop there - the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? as green points out; we have yet to fully find out, but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us.for those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program - fear not. professor green does a wonderful job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the *concept* - which, when you take away all the math from it, transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and, as green constantly points out, 'elegant' concept. viewers of this program need no prior background in science; the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them.when you finish this program, you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in.

this program was quite interesting. the way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting. string theory is also very interesting to listen too. the whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it. i enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the physicists. extra dimensions really boggle the mind. if you have the chance, watch this amazing documentary.

my local pbs station whyy philadelphia recently showed "the elegant universe." after three hours of watching it, besides having my brain hurt, i learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes.the last hour of the show was about "string theory" physics, a semi-new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible, but probable. with the "string theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them.although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic, i found the show very interesting and informative. it was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject.

the elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence. after watching this documentary, one can't help but take a step back and rethink their view on the existence of everything. there is a large cast of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory. it is continually brought into question as untested, untestable, and possibly dead wrong. the closest to proselytizing that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to sub-atomic particles, has never made an incorrect prediction. not so with string theory; no one is willing to say, on-camera, that string theory is the truth, and in so doing, the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject.

i cannot believe someone gave this movie a 1 rating!!! and it is only a 3. average... what is not to love about this film? it is original, it has lots of scare scenes that actually made me jump out of my seat, and it has some great special effects. the story is fresh, there is some nudity, and it is very campy. the killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected. i must admit that i really love this film, one of spain's best horror films ever. if you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to get out there and try to find this film. you will be pleasantly surprised to do so.

bit of a curate's egg, this one. i started off hating it, with it's predictable' old dark house' set-up, it's constant references to recent us horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors.but it does get going and has it's moments of originality.i began to wonder , once the killing started, how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective.naschy is fine and by the end it's been an enjoyable enough movie. it just does not jump up and grab one, hard enough.

six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre took place for a night of fun and pranks. instead the kids run afoul of the vicious crazed security guard (excellently played with supremely creepy menace by spanish horror icon paul naschy) who committed the nasty killings. director carlos gil relates the intriguing story at a brisk pace and does an adept job of creating a compellingly spooky and mysterious atmosphere. the witty script by tino blanco and mercedes holgueras offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end. the slick cinematography by fernando arribas makes expert use of light and shadow. david san jose's moody score likewise does the trick. the attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances, with especially praiseworthy turns by carlos fuentes as ringleader ramon, olivia molina as the panicky maria, zoe berriatua as obnoxious joker jordi, and carmen morales as spunky goth chick sandra. the murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be. terrific whammy of a surprise dark ending, too. a solid and satisfying shocker.

why has ramón(carlos fuentes)brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth? that answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father. what they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six, with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard(paul naschy)which occurred 20 some odd years ago. but, as they seek out a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives, often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways. will ramón and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them?stylish spanish slasher has that professional gloss and potent, shocking violence to match. some witty exchanges between the characters..layered in their dialogue are pop-culture references to american horror films which might annoy some viewers. a demented naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully..quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish. i found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. i don't think these tricks are necessarily needed, but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks. a minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave. the twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt, but this might(..or might not)work considering how the story plays out regarding why ramón's father is shown amongst those ghosts re-enacting those grisly events two decades prior. i will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail, but as a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air.

oz, is one of the most mind-blowing and addictive tv experiences ever.having caught pieces of this on sbs, i was at first skeptical, however, having finished now the 4th season, i sadly know that that this brilliant show is approaching its end, (6 seasons), and yet i still can't get enough of oz. want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit...oz fits the bill, hands down.this isn't kid's stuff, folks, its violent, brutal, and not pretty. why, its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison.tom fontana's oz is brilliant in all the right departments, the actors, the writing, and directing.hbo's oz site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for info about this series. this was the first one-hour show, produced by hbo, and it proves what a master-work it is and that others would follow.thank-you hbo

one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many..aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...oz doesn't mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn't say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.

hbo created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job. oz was created by the creators of homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison. this show is what launched the idea of every other hbo original program such as the sopranos, sex and the city, the wire, arliss, deadwood, and six feet under amongst others. oz is the nickname for the oswald state penetentiary, a fictional prison in some us state which is never stated (though with the accents, crime scenes, and racial distribution ny is assumed). the main prison unit looked at on the show is emerald city, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privlages than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named tim mcmanus. overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison.there are about 10 gangs shown on oz. first we have the muslims, a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere. they are led by kareem said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system. as a group they are not so much anti-white but rather anti-injustice. our second group of blacks is the homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behaviors up and run the drug trade. their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. in this group, one character who is acted terrifically is simon adebisi. adebisi is an african inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive. this gang as a whole gets side help from the irish at times and is always in conflict with the latinos and sicilians for drug distribution purposes. being that oz is mostly black, the homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside.the latinos and sicilians, like the homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show. the sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in oz. the latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control. unlike the homeboys however, these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage. the irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and snakelike ryan o'reily. o'reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants. they are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are.amongst the whiter inmates, we have the bikers and aryans. the bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the aryans out most of the time. the aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of oz. they are led by vern schillinger who is amongst the most racist, sickest, and sadistic characters one will ever see. both gangs control nothing illegal, they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. we also have the others. the others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate. in this group we see tobias beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison. we also see augustus hill, a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate. the character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. finally amongst gangs, there are the christians and gays. the christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the gays are a bunch of cross-dressers who are often raped by other inmates.this show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison. since language is unedited, we here more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other tv show. augustus hill's commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with oz. this show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted. it explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible, prison rape, murders, fatal stabbings, and general gore than anything anyone else has seen. in my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever created but i can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show. if you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison, oz is a must see.

oz is the tv show which is intensive non-stop adrenaline. its a show which is not aimed at a large audience but a specific one as its themes are very adult orientated. it obviously did not achieve mainstream success as this was an impossibility but had much fame with its audience and many famous actors either guest starred or became part of the show.oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the new york state. there are many different ethnic groups which play a somewhat equal role in being represented. these groups are the muslims, homeboys, aryans, bikers, italians, latinos, irish, christians, gays and others. some have some form of affiliation with each other such as the bikers and aryans whilst the aryans are the enemy's of numerous groups such as the muslims and the homeboys. in oswald penitentary (its official name) there is a policy that not too many members from any one ethnic group may be allowed. it is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to or from in the show is called "general population" or "gen pop". the main character of the show is augustus hill who also narrates the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical one. hill is bound to wheelchair usage as a consequence of his unknown past. he is part of the "others" group which features individuals which don't fit into the other prison gangs.of the many groups it is the smaller ones which are able to keep themselves avoided by trouble most of the times as the larger ones are busy in conflict with one another. are few of the most noteworthy characters are as follows: 1)ryan o'reilly is in charge of his fellow irishmen and somehow always voluntarily gets himself involved in lethal activity for the weakest link. 2)miguel alvarez is the watched latino who has constant struggles with coping with his popularity within his own gang and with others. 3)simon adebesi is the nigerian who was the former leader of the homeboys gang. hes also very physically quite large and solid. these two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful inmates inside of oz. 4)karim said is the muslim and black nationalist who is a very defined in his opinions and desires. he fights for the rights of his people on many levels through the show, from his own muslim group, to his wider black group and even fighting for all the groups against the unjust rules of authority. he character seems in some ways identical to malcom x, the famous black rights fighter who was also muslim.all in all, for its genre oz is possibly the greatest (fictional prison show or show based on ethnic relations). if it doesn't sound as if your own type of series it probably shouldn't be tried out, but if it does interest, then it is definitely worth viewing. the biggest problem with the show is how it is addictive, some may feel wrong viewing a lot of this kind of material. researchers argue on whether it is harmful or not but in the end it is just a reflection of the society of the world we live in today. this means that it is as an informant and an indicator of the world than an aggressor.

this show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama. there are twists and turns all the way till the season finally. the characters are very strong, and it gives the show a lot of power. when watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners, but the prison staff. the actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner. also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows. the only problem with oz is that it was not long enough. this show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old. even after the season finale i sill find myself watching oz all the time on dvd. this show is easily one of the best shows on television. don't be a fool, go watch oz.

what a great show! a very underrated dramatic show. it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character(s) are the main character(s).i think the best character on the show is vern schillinger. he is a tough, bad guy and an aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be. this show has many murders, i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show, but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so great.i think some characters were killed off a little early, but some sure still made their mark. you can't compare things like prison break to this show, they are totally different. i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them. a great show, my favorite's. a show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come.

yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the plot lines became over the top, melodramatic and very unrealistic, however, it didn't matter because the show is great. you really get involved in the characters and every character, no matter how minor or major, is perfectly cast.i can't imagine anyone else except jk simmons play the neo-nazi racist rapist leader, nor anyone else playing tobias beecher except lee tergesen. the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing. however, the character that made oz oz was chris keller (played by christopher meloni). he didn't have relations with anyone else in prison except beecher (well, except ronnie barlog, but that was only to get ronnie to stop playing around with keller's lover boy, beecher). their relationship transcended sexes and tom fontana actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together.i loved vern's soft spot for his kids in the show and how fontana made sympathetic characters out of all these heinous criminals that we grew to adore, even simon adebesi. however, some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic: * a guy building a bomb in oz * guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their pods looking at other men plotting something in their mind - too over the top. * drugs getting in oz * everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years. * people getting killed in the gym, supply closet and kitchen. * no one hurting ryan's mom * no one fighting cyril outside the boxing ring (except vern of course) * two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dying with no investigation. * karl metzger (guard) gets killed and no one investigates. * governor holds all his press conferences at the prison * all an inmate needs to do is say "i want to see glenn" or "i want to see mcmanus" and they are taken to them no questions asked. * people die every week in oz * on the outside, people kill someone and get 20 years, up for parole in eight, but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately * there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room - inmates run both departments no questions asked * aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served * ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt, killed, maimed, raped or beaten. * the guys never flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up. * an nba scout comes to the prison to recruit for an nba player (yeah right)however, with all these flaws, this show is still awesome. it's gruesome, brutal, sexy, edgy, raw and innovative. dean winters, scott william winters, jk simmons, christopher meloni, luiz guzman, adele (the guy that played simon adebisi), eammon walker, lee tergesen, terry kinney, mums, male alexander, ll cool j, etc, etc, etc. all are awesome and made the show worth watching. i highly recommend renting this on dvd. season six comes out 9/06 (next month). first five seasons are on dvd - watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary. i loved the director's commentary with chazz palmentari. the sequence with andy schillinger running down the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome, top notch shot!!!! kudos! and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between beecher and keller - simply amazing!! brilliant!!! that'd have to be so weird for meloni to touch tergesen's private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene!! wow! pulled that off beautifully, pun intended!i'm waiting for oz: the next generation!!!! (like with star trek, etc.) c'mon!!! let's get it started!!!!

one of the best tv shows out there, if not the best one. why? simple: it has guts to show us real life in prison, without any clichés and predictable twists. this is not prison break or any other show, actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for children's. profanity, cursing, shots of explicit violence and using drugs, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes... all this and more in oz. but this is not the best part of oz; the characters are the strongest point of this show; they're all excellent and not annoying, despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals. the actors are excellent, my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan o'reilly and tobias beecher, because they're so unique and changing their behavior completely. and most of all... the don't have no remorse for their actions. overall... oz is amazing show, the best one out there. forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors... this is the deal... oz!

i admit that i almost gave up on watching tv shows. why? because most of them are about doctors, forensics or some girl/boy, who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat. but i must say i was wrong when i watched the first episode of oz, one of the most brilliant shows on tv until today. oz is a show about maximum secure prison and shows episodes in life of every cell - mate inside the prison and their frustrations. what i like about this show is the fact it has the courage to show the real life in prison without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogs. even thought the characters in the show are not supposed to be heroes, you became quickly attached to them and their life. sure, their is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and taking drugs, but that's the point of this show; to present how brutal and frustrating can be life in prison... heck, you can't show life in prison like a "clean environment" with "likeable characters", right? oz is perfect in every way, the actors are doing an excellent job and the whole hour of this show is going threw really really fast. the only thing that i didn't like in this show was the last season of the show, i think it became too weird and brutal and the finale was not satisfying. but overall oz is still my favorite show on tv so far, it surpasses sopranos and million csi and dr. house crap with just a main title. brilliant show which has the balls to show what other shows are taking away from us; realism.

shawn michaels vs. edge-8- kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men, edge, whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring, and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs. heidenreich. casket match-2- ok, after a good opening match, now this, what a crappy match. undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble, and 1998's royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match, but this is way worse then that match.kurt angle vs. big show vs. bradshaw. triple threat wwe championship-6- it's alright, i feel all three men could of given a better performance, this just really didn't show them at their best.randy orton vs. triple h. world heavyweight championship-9- triple h gets a clean win, can you believe it, sure he takes out the sledgehammer but doesn't use it. randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion, but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous. i really liked this match, this was the best performance i've seen from hhh in forever.the royal rumble match-7- this was highly entertaining and i usually don't score the royal rumble match this high. the winner is again, very predictable, but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments i've seen in a while.overall, this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans.

a respectable royal rumble event1. edge vs shawn michaels7.5/10 a very strong opener...edge's heel performance was sublime as it was during the rumble event ..overall id say edges night....2. undertaker vs heidenreich casket match7/10 a lot of people hated this rivalry though i liked it, i thought heidenreich really played his character well. the match wasn't amazing in excitement that was until kane and snitcky get involved .it gets better as it goes on.3. kurt angle vs big show vs jbl(wwe champ) wwe title match7.5/10 a surprisingly good match , as there was only 1 really exciting in ringer in it ..angle of course......very good title match ..good pace.. though a predictable end .but aren't all royal rumble title matches predictable.4. triple h (world title) vs randy orton world title match6.5/10 actually not that good for the guys involved, went on too many dry patches, orton sold his concussion amazingly, ending though was some what of an anti climax.5. royal rumble event... btw during the other matches there were a few segments...two which were really cool ...cena rapping on christian and guerrero stealing flairs number 30 entry ticket. the event was good 7/10 would have got a 9 if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins(though i understood why) ..vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena crack up in laughter.

the 2005 edition of the royal rumble came live from the save mart centre in fresno, california. the two top championships of the wwe were being defended, the undertaker was battling heidenreich in a casket match, shawn michaels was taking on edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last october and of course the every man for himself over the top rope royal rumble match itself. who was going to take the price this year? chris benoit? edge? eddie guerrero? edge? john cena? batista? edge? shawn michaels? there was no shortage of contenders.it was batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy, or should i say, a botched finish. batista and john cena were the final two men in the ring. batista was supposed to dump the young smackdown! star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor. the referees acted on their feet as we had an arm-raising contest similar to that of bret hart and lex luger back in 1994. this brought out the chairman of the board. vinnie mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring. it was unusual to see vince mcmahon sitting, legs out, telling the two men to restart the match. batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped cena to the floor sealing his own future with a championship match at wrestlemania 21.the undercard for this years royal rumble had a very solid line up, with many of wwe's biggest stars competing in matches. each brand had two big matches each.raw opened the night with the match between shawn michaels and edge. this was a good technical contest. back and fourth all the way until edge got the pinfall. this was a smart booking decision and kept edge as a contender to the world heavyweight championship.the second match of the night was the feud ending casket match between the undertaker and heidenreich. the match was not a classic, but then again have their been any classic casket matches? it was entertaining. especially when snitsky got involved and then kane popped out the casket to a great pop. the undertaker surprised no one when he got the win, slamming the lid on heidenreich and this mediocre feud.the first of the two championship matches of the night was john bradshaw layfields defence of the wwe championship in a triple threat match against both kurt angle and the big show. this match was very good. again, not a classic but entertaining none the less. jbl took the win after pinning kurt angle. his celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy long informed him at no way out he would defend the wwe championship in a barbed wire steel cage match against big show. not a very nice way to spend a sunday night.and of course there is no show without punch. punch of course being reigning world heavyweight champion triple h. his rematch from unforgiven 2004 with randy orton was lot better than the original encounter. it's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did. orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to the game.so the first big one of 2005 was a good one. it achieved its goals. feuds ended and new ones began. we were now officially on the road to wrestlemania 21.

i have enjoyed both of the van dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again.just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy.dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older.son berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps.together they make a great team and work well together.i am disappointed that i have not found another murder 101 listed anywhere.i have seen both of the ones that have been shown. i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch.you can sure tell berry follows in his dad footsteps, they talk alike and have the same mannerisms.would enjoy anything they do separately.will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together.

if you enjoyed the tv series, diagnosis murder, you'll love murder 101. it's great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again. if we're lucky, this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies.this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles. but, it didn't feel like a "face" movie. it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen.i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again! this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover!

this was essentially a remake of "diagnosis murder" minus victoria rowell, scott baio & charlie schlatter. dick is playing a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom. barry is now a private eye, not related to dick. this lets barry shoot at guys speeding away from him, which a cop can not do. barry still gets the girl in the end. tracey needham portrays the girl. she is the prime suspect and dick and barry believe she's innocent and prove it. that's all the spoiler you get. the ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie.don't take it seriously. don't critique it. just sit back and enjoy dick and barry van dyke.

psycho criminal pure by carl schenkel, who is active in hollywood, like mrs soutendijk. goetz george and hannes jaenicke are stealing the spectator's last peace of snugness. they are too able, how can i get calm into a lift next time ?

admittedly, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. the ravishing woman first panics and then, only a few minutes later, she starts kissing the young lad while the old guy is right next to her. but as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or slut) and that partly explains her behavior. the cinematography of this movie is well done. we get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension. götz george plays his character well, a wannabe hot-shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the jaennicke character. wolfgang kieling who i admired in hitchcock's the torn curtain delivers a great performance that, although he doesn't say much, he is by far the best actor in this play. one critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen. but then again, how realistic are films such as mission impossible or phone booth. given the fact that we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't very likely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. it's a lot better than many things that i see on german tv these days and i think that the vintage 80's style added something to this film.

i must i was a little skeptical when i entered the cinema to watch oss117 : french comedies tend to be so self-satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box-office. but i was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the monthy pythons, the many references to the french's vision of the world in the 1950, which oss117 represents, are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film-making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity. to put it short, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors. and at least for once, jean dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) complies perfectly with the character he plays.

what a pleasure. this is really a parody. only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse. and as a result, you spend a really good time watching jean dujardin playing the dumb. most of the movie stands on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. he has the perfect way of overdoing the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike meyers in austin powers for example. the dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator, with a lot of stupid jokes, that's really perfect. both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character, and that was a challenge. there is no really plot in this movie, but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie. you just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes, and that's precisely what the movie manage to do. it deserves the success it has in france

if you're going to spoof james bond it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles both sean connery and leonard rossiter so step forward jean dujardin who captures perfectly the connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self-delusion of rossiter thinking he is suave. dujardin plays it like a clouseau who can hold his own at karate. the plot has him looking for our man in schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid. if there is a jarring note it is the leading lady, berenice bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by aure atika. it's good for one viewing but that's about it.

it's a deeply stupid humor... but i loved it. jean dujardin is a great actor in this movie. bérénice béjo is cute. it makes fun of all the secret agents like james bond: refreshing!!! it's probably the most hilarious movie i've ever seen. i already saw it three times and i still want to see it again. buy the dvd as soon as you can. you won't regret it. it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody. the only defect is that oss 117 is too short. it's a jewel. it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed. trust me!!!

pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re: the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then. the fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a peter lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. a big plus: jean dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job. funny aside: the people behind me in the theater kept gasping after every plot twist as if they were watching a 'real' spy thriller.before the movie started, a trailer for "get smart" was screened. the preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate the jokes and gags from the tv series. looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and gags of oss 117, though, of course, oss had its share of misfires. the overall tone of oss, however, was not an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the material didn't feel as it had been 'dumbed down.' i did get the distinct impression that if i understood the language, i would have caught more of the jokes, and one in particular (the pistol gag) was mishandled in the interpretation for the subtitles.

romuald et juliette is one of those french romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules, rather like trop belle pour toi. the gorgeous daniel auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash around his ears. the film isn't a preachy morality tale, but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the last. firmine richard (as juliette) is a heroine that women will cheer - her laughter is my abiding memory of this warm and witty film. the down-to-earth way she has of including all her children by their different fathers - particularly the birthdays - gives the film an edge that lifts it above your average romantic comedy. but its always the french that seem to show us how effortless this all is!

one of the two best films of the year. a well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast. lau ching wan and his friends (dayo wong chi wa, anthony wong chau sun, francis ng chun yu, jordan chan siu chun, cheung man tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. theresa lee plays her comedic role well (though much like a female version of michael wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers.), and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something i haven't done since 1. the fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. john woo's hardboiled. sure the ending was expected, but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. highly enjoyable.

i'm slowly ploughing through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem - mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my favourite actors.its a great action film although not as ott as the title might suggest. it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable.the biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack. it would appear that rob dougan - the guy who did the 'clubbed to death' song which was popular in 'the matrix' has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his 'furious angels' album; the tune in question is called 'im not driving anymore' and is also the opening tune for the tv series 'law and order' and the opening track on the 'matrix reloaded' dvd menu teaser! that really surprised me, due to the sheer conincidence!

this film has some really impressive action scenes. the humor and action are blended well, though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end. the last scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of action quality and astonishing explosiveness of the scenes preceding it. the humor doesn't seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other hongkong movies, and this film is of totally other class than most american action-comedies of recent years. lau ching-wan acts as a typical, intuitive police-hero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors. the dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang, humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake. yu rong-guang is especially impressive as an ultra cool, merciless gangster in this woo-like piece of action where tough guys are truly die-hard.

i guess i have to write something here, although i think my one summary says it all. i'm not a huge ted danson fan... nothing against the man, just hasn't "done it" for me. this covers the sides of swift's novel that were never covered before. you can tell the cast was having a wonderful time filming this.

this version of the gulliver stories is definitely bizarre. the production adds a frame story (that's what it's becoming famous for) of gulliver returning to his wife and son. in one vieweing, incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout, but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking. mary steenburgen does the best job of the cast. danson seems a bit out of place with his american accent. the whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often, but is nonetheless interesting and holds the journeys of gulliver together well. danson's character really does seem insane, however... he should have worked on being a little more believeable to everyone, in my opinion. also confusing is going from present to past. anyone else think the yahoos are the ugliest things ever to grace a television screen (or in line for it)? confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by some good acting, overall wonderful visual effects, and a few enjoyable parts. nbc's first of many event films from robert halmi, sr. see it for yourself to decide how it goes for you, however i give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).

at first i didn't like they way the director was constantly switching from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present (gulliver in the insane asylum). but it really is the best way to film the story even though it took some getting used to. danson is outstanding as the title character and edward fox makes a wonderful villain. worst part is mary steenburgen as gulliver's wife. she never has been hollywood gorgeous and in this film they make her look downright dowdy for some reason. i'll never understand why directors make a woman ugly when it adds nothing to the story! plus you want to strangle her for being so damn stupid in believing the lies bad guy bates keeps telling her. even her son can see thru the bastard. still a good show and i rate it b+.

swift's socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well done remake. (did you know there is no hyphen after "well"? fact.) he meets warlike miniatures, socialist giants, head-in-the-clouds (literally) philosophers, and pacifist horses who rule over yahoos -- nearly neanderthal humanoids. (is that where "yahoo" came from?) we also meet the dastardly dr. bates, the devoted mary gulliver, the sweet and devoted son thomas, and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum. suspension of disbelief comes easily, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and i did. (sorry for the length, imdb requires 10 lines.)

gulliver's travels is, at the beginning, a satiric novel written by a great misanthropist called jonathan swift. so it is not recommended to judge of this movie, just by itself. we must go deeper into man's conscience to get to the point where swift would have lead us. gulliver has lived a voyage of truthfulness, of solitude, of apprehension of what may be his true life. we cannot just sit and watch that movie, saying it is so cutie or so boring. the matter is far beyond that and i would like everyone to expect that. this is the greatest movie ever, as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from ted danson's character: the unforgettable lemuel gulliver.

despite its many faults, hallmark's 1995 version of gulliver's travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical classic - largely because it not only includes all of gulliver's many travels but also includes the satire that's often overlooked. unfortunately the twin problems of the book's highly episodic structure and a television budget (even a fairly lavish one) remain. the book is a somewhat rambling collection of traveller's tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another, but simon moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed. the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world. the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting. the lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces - this has to be the only version where we don't see gulliver pulling the blefescu fleet behind him.yet once gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the utopians of brobdingnag, a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left, the guest/prisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source, offered immortality with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the houynhnhms that he's not an uncivilized yahoo, each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is. for the most part it's a darker set of travels than expected, with only gulliver's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness - and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane. it's in these latter scenes that ted danson's gulliver really shines, never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race.being made for television, the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page, but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down. the star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well-used (if somewhat briefly in a few cases) - mary steenburgen, james fox, peter o'toole, edward woodward, omar sharif, shashi kapoor, edward fox, ned beatty, alfre woodard, kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them. it's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this.

this production was quite well done for a television original, providing a very appropriate original slant on swift's work. to make the frame story work well the film begins with gulliver arriving home. everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway. the frame story of the book has gulliver's crazed confusion in sections. for example, he is horrified that he will trample little people in england because he has just returned from a land of giants. but the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. when gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from england to the travel are very effective. i confess i found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they became natural. by the end, moreover, they have become a welcome addition to the story. as he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth. for example, his hatred of filthy yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity. the intercuts between events in england and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective. for example, ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming. the addition of gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. swift only hints at this by having the long-suffering wife protest against further voyages. it becomes a natural part of this story. the casting and acting were competent throughout. some roles were exemplary. omar sharif's mad magician is superb. o'toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility. many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are about here. i read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on. i may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since. and i had to start it again as i began reading about this film. while the danson version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. however, i think it will bring many readers to the book. if you have not read the book, enjoy this movie then go to the source. if you appreciate the satire in it, find swift's "a modest proposal" and his "drapier's letters." both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of ireland and the irish during swift's time. the drapier protests cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped on ireland. these were wood's light weight coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. the outcry from swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated british territory, the american colonies. the universal satire in swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. give danson's torturous experiences a chance. i think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining.

i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high. i was riveted to it! i loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the trial-aspect and flashback method of telling the story.several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say, i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story the movie is better. it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whatever.it's much more arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway. as a side note, when i saw laputa i was stunned. it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game (1995) that also made me like this mini-series even more.i saw it again about 4 years ago, and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much. really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini-series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland.

excellent story-telling and cinematography. poignant, biting social commentary.superb effects. well-filmed and acted.however, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) at times drags on a little too much (about 3 hrs), and over-interrupts the flow of the story.i first read the book as a child, and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people -- but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the "yahoos"! well, although the adventure plot may sound like a children's story, it's in fact a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decay in england at the time of jonathan swift, the author of the novel that the film is based upon.

john cassavetes is on the run from the law. he is at the bottom of the heap. he sees negro sidney poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends, forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by jack warden.as someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when i was younger, i can tell you that the warehouse fights, complete with tumbling packing cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets. i've been in fights like these myself, although no one got killed.the introduction of sidney poitier's widow is a variation on shakespeare's shylock "do i not bleed?" this is an anti racist film, which, at the time, was much needed.all the three principle characters - warden, cassavetes and poitier - are superb, with warden the most outstanding of the three.

martin ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer (three years later) to elia kazan's more conservative "on the waterfront." while "waterfront" benefited immensely from an electrifying marlon brando, who inadvertently disguised kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify naming names (as kazan did eagerly before the house un-american activities committee), "edge of the city" boasts a young john cassavetes and an upstart sidney poitier daring to confront issues that "waterfront" failed to acknowledge, namely, workers' rights and race relations."edge of the city" boldly dives into this (then) unknown territory, and although the quite appealing black protagonist (poitier) may seem a bit hollywood simplistic, the courageous struggle against thinly-veiled bigotry and violence has hardly aged at all. one wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of white-black relations (if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early, they must of left dumbfounded, if not offended). the last reel of the film will still surprise audiences, as it refuses to sink into expected clichés, including those that tainted "waterfront." only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film "edge of the city" ends up being.what's most disturbing about this lost classic: how it sadly remains unavailable on any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy. this film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country, yet one can only find it on obscure late-night tv, if ever at all.

alex north (john cassavetes) has problems in relationship with his father and flees home to join the army, from where he very soon deserts and comes to new york intending to start a new life, using as an advantage the fact that nobody knows about his past. he finds a job at the waterfront, where he meets tommy tyler (sydney poitier) a lively young man, who is happily married and is a living contrast to cassavetes' sad and unhappy character. they very quickly become good friends and tommy does his best to help his friend. the only problem is that their superior at work, a tough worker charles malik (jack warden) is sort of envious of their friendship as well as tommy's constant happy disposition and success in personal life. he really manages to make their life difficult when he comes to know the truth about alex's past. a good drama skillfully directed by academy award nominated director-producer martin ritt (the hud) and featuring wonderful performances from sydney poitier and jack warden. 7/10

shame represents a high point in the career of a master. ingmar bergman penetrating, existential study of a couple on the island of gotland dealing with surviving a long war. liv ullman and max von sydow give painfully detailed performances in this spare, stark drama. the films intensity rests in bergman's keeping our focus on the minute, intimate relations of his two characters - both accomplished musicians - trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand. we see the way the external pressures of the war complicate and corrode their relationship. both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own sense of ethics. in one of the most powerful episodes bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with ullman's character that has been re-edited and distorted for political effect by one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene.

a very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public, shame gives us a chilling understanding oh ingmar bergman's beliefs. the absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling. there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality. at times the storyline was confusing, but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters' frame of mind  how they too do now know what is happening or why. the simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring, but i could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points. he depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war. in the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long, drawn-out shots. when all of a sudden the war struck upon them, they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots. bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war. although the storyline itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.

extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts. the depiction of the fighting parties as faceless, superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to orwell's 1984, even if bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war. that is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards eva's and jan's marriage are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was toilsomely covered with lambencies before. an intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.

this begrudging and angry film is against not just the war during which it was made, but all war. it doesn't care what war it is. it might be the most emotionally involving experience i have ever had with ingmar bergman's work. there are no sides to the two main characters in this impacting drama, which doesn't intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per bergman's usual, but plainly showcases people and their lives and exercises what bergman has already proved he understands about a person's reaction to a movie.his top-drawer regulars liv ullmann and max von sydow play an internalizing but bickering married couple who were once orchestra musicians. now they live in a weathered farm house on an island. part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people fertilizes in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work. they are not reclusive intellectuals, either. they are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical; they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. ullmann is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children. her husband von sydow shrugs off that the war will pass them by. their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house, the killing of a parachuting airman, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition, and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side, but loyalties have long since splintered. they are sent back to their home, witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an agonizingly distrustful marriage. this, one of my top favorite bergman efforts, is a study of a couple jarred from their safely self-unaware lives and violated by a manipulative despair, testing them both to reveal who they really are. she lacks compassion to some extent, too self-serving and restless to have any patience for his capricious breakdowns into crying. his suppressed emotional issues have led to the repression of the very initiative and excitement that attracted them to begin with. the immense last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by images of the overwhelming gray sky, are among the closest to real emotion that bergman ever filmed.all systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait. the basically clearcut personalities of ullmann and von sydow's characters are hurled into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being "sympathizers," but the film, shot on bergman's small home island of faro, doesn't give any information about where or when it's set, who the two sides are, and for what they're fighting. to an uninvolved civilian caught in between, the knowledge base is likely to be quite similar.ullmann and von sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy, but they're partisans for who are apparently their side. this 1968 reactive allegory could be about the common noncombatant citizens of iraq, or kosovo, or vietnam, or israel, or palestine, or...

ingmar bergman's meditation on war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (of what country isn't specified). raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports. as they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them. bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less. its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of armies at war where most of the casualties are the civilians have come of age. this is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head, "what do i do now?". as an intellectual exercise the film is top notch, this is a film that will make you think. as an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving. i was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip flops. (i should state that i admire bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table, however i have never been moved by his films. i am not a "fan". i always sided with fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films). reservations aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war, for most of us, is just a thing on a tv screen.

bergman's regular max von sydow and liv ullmann starred as a village couple, jan and eva rosenberg. the story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up. jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. eva is a practical woman who is getting fed up with her husband's lack of ambition. because jan procrastinating in fixing their radio, the are oblivious of the impending war. of course the war arrived, and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government.there were no musical score to the movie, but the soundtrack was the war noise. in one scene the pulsating background gun shot, the explosion, and sound of the fly by planes was incredible. now and then, bergman zoomed into the facial expression as different event took places. when something violent happened, he zoomed out to let the audience sensed the violence rather than seeing up close. very well done movie.

this film offers one of the greatest experiences available to movie-goers. it is by no means a pleasant film, but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon. it opens pathways in how an individual thinks, and afterwards will change the person forever. the first time i saw this film was in class, and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to reset my body and mind. i felt devastated and, somehow unreal, as if i didn't exist. it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame, and she asked, "oh, is that when you were messed up after seeing it, and ran into me talking all strange about it?" i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day, i was astonished. in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war. there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end...there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates. its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake, altering your own reality forever. this film must be seen.

what bergman has got here is "what if all that bad stuff happened here in sweden, to nice people like us?" and what he gives us, in the swedish language, with swedish actors, on swedish locations (and using what appear to be genuine swedish military vehicles) is what was familiar from war films set in almost every other country in europe-- all the confusing invasions and counter-invasions, political lies, internment camps, faked confessions, summary executions, torture, turncoats, "collaborators", and so on. as in a modern short story, it's done in the abstract, with no real names, cities, or countries used. but the stronger faction are "nazis": they strut about self-importantly, and some wear shiny knee boots. one even whips things with a riding crop (ok, it's actually a cane). the victimized couple are named rosenberg. apart from the shame they feel at finding dirtier ways to survive-- and who would not do what they did?-- what all of the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to stockholm's de facto complicity with the nazis. indeed, what we are shown is what sweden might have looked like if germany had asked for a bit more than mining concessions.the first half plays like a black comedy. we see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignore the troops all around, the long convoys, the bombed-out buildings, the news reports, &c. they do not even bother to find a working radio. they are the ultimate in "not in my backyard". they talk of wine and lingonberries; meanwhile friends are mysteriously conscripted and growing numbers of troops show up in the town. they show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years.the man (von sydow) is cultured, sulky, and a navel-gazer; the woman (ullman) is somewhat more impulsive, passionate, and outward-looking. there's a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the manufacturer, he says offhandedly, fought in the napoleonic wars, but his own interest stops with the cultural artifact in his hand-- or, more precisely, which his own warm feelings about owning it, and the security that that ownership assumes. not in my backyard! but when war finally breaks into their bucolic idyll, the man's timidity, an irritation in good times, turns into a liability, one he ends up overcompensating for-- as is often the case-- as bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully. definitely worth seeing.

this is one of the bleakest, the most harrowing of bergman's films i've seen. i also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to the human souls.the couple of musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would have ordinarily been impossible for them even imagine, as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war. they betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. liv ullmann and max von sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused, and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war.9.5/10

the apolitical musicians eva (liv ullmann) and jan rosenberg (max von sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent. they provide lingenberry to a couple of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies. they love each other and eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. when the rebels arrive in the island, their peaceful and calm lives turn to hell, and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides. when colonel jacobi (gunnar björnstrand) stalks eva, jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference."shame" is an antiwar movie by the master ingmar bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists that are apolitical and does not listen to the news, but when the war arrives to their lands, they have their love, friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers. liv ullmann and max von sydow have top-notch performances as usual and i do not recall seeing the breast of liv ullmann in any other movie. the process of brutalization of the pacific and sensitive jan rosenberg by the war is impressive and the bleak open conclusion is pessimist and adequate to the dramatic story. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "vergonha" ("shame")

i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. i didn't know what to expect precisely, and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film. it was beginning very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read.but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it. it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies i've ever seen, at the same time human, ruthless and psychologically so convincing.seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully, with such an intensity on their faces : liv ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and sydow is excellent too.there is always psychological violence in bergman movies, and this one may be the most physically violent of them all. the strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them...finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. an excellent bergman.

this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. this, in my opinion, is rob lowe at his best. i'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating. i guess you either love it or hate it, but if nothing else, it is definitely worth a rental.

this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. it may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the world war ii era, but i recommend that all others beware. many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. the story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story. i also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying, partially due to some strong english accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. i give this a 55/100. most folks will want to "steer" clear.

***************************mild spoilers ahead**************************we dive at dawn is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role. the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the samll screen. may be it was the big screen viewing that helped?i still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled, but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the movie takes off too! the search for the german battleship named the brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting!i'm increasing my rating to 7/10. if you enjoy ww ii films, i think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway. some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor, too!

i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour. it was more like eastenders goes to sea than in which we serve. the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). some of the throwaway lines are very witty ("i'm not joining the band of hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!). my only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to the irish coxswain and his bride to be, or the tattooed po and his "i love arabella" tattoo!

if you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. and that's just what director anthony asquith provided the british with 1943's naval war film, we dive at dawn. after more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. it doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring. here, as in so many other british war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in england's finest ruling-class establishments. in this movie, freddie taylor (john mills), the captain of the submarine sea tiger, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, quick to make a decision. and it helps that he's lucky. his men are jolly tars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave, after that things get tense quickly. taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the brandenburg, a new german battleship. they just miss the ship when it enters the kiel canal and heads into the baltic. taylor assesses the risks and decides the sea tiger will go after it, through mine fields, anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base. after several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. the sea tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. after a clever subterfuge, taylor outfoxes a couple of german destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel. he plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when, just at the last moment, james hobson (eric portman), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks german, says there is a small danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot. he thinks it might still be for the germans. the last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the sea tiger back to britain. this is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. and did the sea tiger actually put the brandenburg down? are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? did hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? did freddie taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? you'll have to see the movie. there are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. some, like powell's and pressburger's one of our aircraft is missing and the 49th parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. others, like we dive at dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. still, asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. the sea tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. the stalking of the brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; john mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. the fake-out preparations to make the sea tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. we dive at dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. john mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. especially in the fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those wwii days. he had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man england could be proud of as he fought the war. top-billed in this movie was eric portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but portman manages some complexity for his character. mills and portman did fine jobs working together on this film.

this is an excellent tub-thumper from the war years.john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b-movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship.filmed in black and white, it's well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time. if anything, it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda.the mission-side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines. things are cramped and claustrophobic. the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments, as well as the engine-room activities.this probably is the first movie in which debris (and a dead german) is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer. and it's the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking - a high risk gamble if ever there was one.i'm a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire-rope net. submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed, and the net would have had a great deal of 'give'. also, the engineer was at the same work-station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged. this, too, seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so i'm told.there was a wee bit too much shore-side drama for my tastes. but then, this was a propaganda effort, and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort.these niggles aside, it's a pretty entertaining little adventure. nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon, whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime-time. but then; it's no longer politically-correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends (too many of them have guilty consciences), or our own left-wing fascists (non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted).as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible. better than 'the enemy below', i think, though less demonstrative. not so authentic as 'das boot' by any means, but not so gross either.

any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion, respectfully. the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive: as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare, i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things. for those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing, rank and british-gaumont studios back in the day: frankly i prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced hollywood movie ever could. this reminds me of powell and pressburger's the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman, a favorite of mine. john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be mr. portman's film but the whole cast shines. as for the title sequence, am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production's lovely pre-cgi gainsborough girl?

the submarine used was not varangian! 'it' was in fact two boats, p614 and p615, both built for turkey by vickers armstorng at barrow-in-furness but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war. p615 was sunk but p614 was eventually delivered in 1945. the confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up p61 (as i did) and found varangian! when in fact, the last digit of both p614 and p615 was in fact just painted out....there are some extremely realistic moments in the film. these turkish boats were very similar to the s-class. as no s-class submarines survive, the shots of them (as p61) and of the depot ship "forth" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an excellent film.

this movie is all about reality, submarine warfare in ww2 was not a clean precise science. there were no computers giving exact enemy details, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial.people with expectations of seeing a "pretty war" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, .............. good, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.war is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into song. it is endured by scared, cold/burnt, hungry, desperate people willing to do anything to survive."we dive at dawn" is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions.

as a teenager, i watched this movie every time it was on tv (and it was on a lot) because of its witty, appealing-to-teenager humor. it may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing, but i love it for what it is--a fun comedy meant to please the audience. the teen actors are of my generation (probably why i love the movie so much) and was like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite tv shows of the early 90's--full house, family matters, fresh prince--all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90's. though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic (or perhaps because of its absence), i highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere.

i think this movie is my favorite movie. i am not sure why, but it is. julia duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile, and when i saw this, i went crazy. it's sort of romantic, and i definitely recommend this movie.

this was a excellent back when it came out. it had some the best talent available and a funny story. between candace cameron and tatyana ali, it was hard to choose who is cuter, and add in carlton from fresh prince and all the other big names, and you get a blockbuster. ok, a made for tv blockbuster, but none the less. if you can find this move, don't miss it.

glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner edger buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. with ford a no-show, the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice, leaving ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit.columbia pictures' first color feature, the desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle.this has the irresistible teaming of a young glenn ford (third-billed but essentially the star) and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles, including scene-stealer edger buchanan as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines.a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama, and comedy, well directed by charles vidor. this is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended.

this is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. it doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. it features former partners randolph scott and glenn ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ford's cheyenne rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals scott's sheriff steve upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). in red valley, upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead. claire trvor portrays countess maletta, a friend of cheyenne's who gives he and buddy "nitro"(guinn 'big boy' williams)a place to stay for the time being. cheyenne desires to go straight, but finds that hard when jack lester(bernard nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob red valley's bank. it is actually jack who is behind the murders, but cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away from. he and nitro will be charged with the murders they didn't commit(the robbery was one cheyenne didn't commit)and it will be upton who must somehow save the day before lester gets away with murder. there are sub-plots which include cheyenne's falling in love with alison mcleod{evelyn keyes;the irony of the story is that alison's father, uncle willie, is actually in cahoots with banker stanley clanton(porter hall)in a planned united theft with lester to steal the town of red valley's loot}. will upton uncover uncle willie and banker clanton's treacherous scheme? will uncle willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? this film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout. columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such. don't expect to get your socks blown off, but the film is simple and well paced.

i liked this western starring randolph scoot and glenn ford.it's got pretty much everything a western should have.there's gunfights,action,chases on horseback.there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at.there's some nice comic relief in the form of edgar buchanan,who plays uncle willie mcleod,a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool,but is actually aware of everything going on.randolph scott plays the town sheriff,and glenn ford plays cheyenne rogers/bill smith,a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways.i liked the different mix of characters in the movie.i didn't find it always fast paced,but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943,it is in colour. 8/10

randolph scott and glenn ford were once outlaw pals together, but now scott's a sheriff and young ford is still hiring his gun out. he gets hired to pull a bank job, but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else. that leads to all kinds of complications, a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long.randy and glenn both got girls here. claire trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold. and evelyn keyes is the daughter of edgar buchanan who falls for ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that scott is the sheriff in.it's b western, but unusual for the time and for columbia pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment. the desperadoes marked glenn ford's first film in technicolor, a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios. harry cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it. and definitely not during war time.the plot gets a bit convoluted as both ford and scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency/duty. the plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in randy's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned.the four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is guinn williams as ford's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick. the climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film.fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one.

probably because this is columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. they seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. randolph scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. evelyn keyes is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire trevor is the countess that runs the saloon. there is a funny character called nitro that does not think twice before blowing it. i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film, one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so i presume they must have gathered all those horses, no easy task. another moment is the final shootout, technically very good. there is also quite a fistfight. seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes, makes you come to a sad conclusion: they don't make them anymore. would they be able to in case they wanted? i have my doubts.

"the desperadoes" (1943) is a genuine classic, not for its story (which is fairly routine), but for its technical production elements. this was a landmark western, the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation. only fox's "jesse james" (also starring randolph scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. although it would be eclipsed in a few years by "the searchers" and "high noon", "the desperadoes" was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. in 1863, the economy in the town of red valley, utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the union army. the script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in utah's future) and custer's last stand (custer was busy fighting stuart in pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. red valley has an honest sheriff, steve upton (scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. the town is visited by cheyenne rogers (glenn ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend steve's. he wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner alison mcleod (evelyn keyes). cheyenne's partner "nitro" rankin (guinn "big boy" williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are uncle willie mcleod (edgar buchanan) and the town judge (raymond walburn who models his character on frank morgan's "wizard of oz" crystal ball faker). taking no chances with their huge budget columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but indians and covered wagons. there is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and three-strip technicolor. all this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. the cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. the indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. scott and claire trevor were top billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote ford, who would soon be their biggest star. and director charles vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife keyes (whose portrayal of scarlett's sister in "gone with the wind" had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). the ford-keyes dynamic is "the desperadoes" most unique and important feature. rather than go for the cliché "love triangle" with scott and/or trevor (which it first appears will happen), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. this was probably the best role keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like kiera knightley's character in "pirates of the caribbean". this was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the waac for wwii military service. "the desperadoes" is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. unfortunately there are no special features on the dvd. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

this movie was very good. i really enjoyed it. tom mccamus' performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son edmund. i also enjoyed the set design (house) and the costumes.

this is a great movie. the best role peter strauss ever did. the music is good, the message harsh, the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw. only in the seventies did they make them like this one!

i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. finally!!!!! it's about time hollywood got their act together. the big studios always frown at edgy material, with oscar written all over it. go figure!!jericho mile was made ahead of it's time. it's a masterpiece.michael mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. peter strauss' emmy award performance is probably the best character role i've seen in my film-viewing lifetime. any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantle).the gritty multi ethnic ensemble, a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world. this is about redemption without public validation, and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers. imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole, that doesn't know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ...what would you do??this movie makes you walk away feeling you haven't been cheated on any level. totally thrilling, engaging, emotional, and a "rolling stones" soundtrack that kick's ass!!!i always thought this would be made for the big screen... can't wait...!!! in the meantime i'll have to continue re-watching my weathered vhs copy i've had for many years.

in the seedy streets somewhere in new york city, a lonely punk named tromeo ( will keenan) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. he does fall for a beautiful rich girl named juliet ( jane jenson) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what, but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them. unfortunately their fathers are at each other as juliet's dad wants to take over tromeo's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at troma is a wonderful modern day take on william shakespeare's romeo and juliet. this was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all, it's got some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant. for me this is the third best troma movie next to the immortal "toxic avenger" and "troma's war" being second, yes the acting can be a little bad like some troma flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, peter jackson, and troma or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story, btw also look for a couple of amusing appearances by the toxic avenger and sgt. kabukiman nypd.also recommended: "the toxic avenger", "meet the feebles", "ichi the killer", " re-animator", "terror firmer", "class of nuke'em high", "romeo and juliet ( 1968 and 1996)", " pieces", " troma's war", " citizen toxie: the toxic avenger 4", "basket case", " riki-oh: the story of ricky", " demons", "new nightmare", " freddy vs. jason", " cabin fever", "nightmare on elm street", " battle royale", " pink flamingos", " perfect blue", " rabid grannies", "surf nazis must die", " hostel", " evil dead ii", "serial mom", " dead alive ( a.k.a. braindead)", " street trash".

tromeo & juliet - 10th anniversary editionwilliam shakespeare's play romeo & juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. sometimes literally following the original text (which is, at times, vague in stage directions), sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece. some are good, many are mediocre. lloyd kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original, modern versions of the bard's creation, it may be placed in a modern-day decaying new york and full of the modern-day anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and kinky sex (which, for the more than casual reader, shakespeare himself wasn't shying away from), but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about, which is quite an effort. kaufman wrote the script with his co-director on the film james gunn, who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies, doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horror-films of the year: slither. lloyd kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with james gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of shakespeare's play that maybe not everyone will "get" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play. with a script that is written entirely in iambic meter, appearances of motorhead's lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching tromeo & juliet is something no one will ever forget. apart from it's historical significance, tromeo & juliet is a treasure for film-lovers of all kind. not only for the script by james gunn, now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie rochon. well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. the 10th anniversary edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many as-yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days. in many ways the extra's on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on kaufman's film-school "make your own damn movie". furtermore historical items from the troma vaults which include james gunn, debbie rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is, apart from looking better then ever, accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries, each and everyone informative, excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days. there are new commentaries (one with kaufman and gunn together), but also the one james gunn did for the original release of the dvd but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc. with fan-recreations of a few of the scenes from the film, a video diary of lloyd kaufman's visit to the set of james gunn's slither and a visit the two brought together to eli roth's hostel birthday party and much more, this is the ultimate set everyone must own. weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the great bard's work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of james gunn, interested in learning more on making films on a low budget, a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever: this is the most important dvd-release of this millennium!

this outlandish troma movie is actually a very good movie. it is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production. their version of shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of troma nudity and gore. troma has made some very good gore films, one of my favorites is "street trash" and of course the toxic avenger movies. i have one troma movie, "terror firmer", which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie. i enjoyed "tromeo and juliet" so much, that i need to finally watch "terror firmer". this is a 2-disc collector's version with four commentaries and many many features. "tromeo and juliet" is an absolute hoot and highly recommended.

once upon a time, troma, the company that brought us cinema classics such as: the toxic avenger, rabid grannies, poultrygeist, redneck zombies and surf nazis must die, decided long ago to adapt shakespeare's famous play, 'romeo and juliet.' this adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest and it succeeded in creating a bizarre yet hilarious film. anyone going into a troma production should know what to expect, and that is irreverent and perverse comedy with plenty of political incorrectness. expect plenty of nods to other troma films and plenty of re-used gags (flipping cars and head squashing). many may think it sounds like utter crap that only morons would find funny...they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and mind-numbingness that is tromeo and juliet.with a great cast, a funny script (by james gunn and lloyd kaufman), a fitting soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags, kaufman has yet again succeeded in turning what is right upside down and grossing the hell out of everyone. get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends over and enjoy tromeo and juliet for what it is, a shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls. the end.4/5

"here on earth" is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about samantha who has both boy problems and health problems. as her love for her current boyfriend, jasper, fades away, her love for kelley blooms like a new spring flower. i found this movie very touching, very warm, very romantic, and touching. i enjoyed every bit of this movie...and that's pretty rare! i highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers! this is one film you don't want to miss!!! :dby the way...if you're a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies, bring tissues!!! on the other hand, it was a really really good movie!!! very romantic...and surprisingly good!!! :d

alright, i'm 12, so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre-teen's point of view. i've also commented on magnolia and bicentennial man, both great movies, if you want to check it out. alright, here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. the writer (i don't know who it was, check imdb) either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love, poetry, and drama. i cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for over 30 minutes. it was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. it's a great movie for anyone, say, 11 and up who isn't a romantic-comedy freak. yeah, it's romantic, yeah, it's comedic, but (in my opinion), it's better than "she's all that" or "whatever it takes". i never cry! it's a tender story. go rent it and tape it :).

i don't understand why critics would bash this movie. it's a teen movie that's actually serious, which is a rarity. i'll admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy, but c'mon it's about young love, it's gotta be sappy to be valid. my biggest complaint is chris klein. while he was funny in american pie, he apparently isn't ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet, he's very uncomfortable looking in some of his "mama stuff". hartnett and sobieski on the other hand, demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability, as do the parent's. although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry, the actor's make it work. the directing sports some powerful images on the screen. beautiful cinematography, nice music, great young actors, i was impressed and i'm a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies.

all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb. you are going to cry when you see this. i mean, this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss. even though i am still a teen, this is how i live my life. when i am with that certain someone, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. so, i give this movie a 10 for it's heartfelt message and touching plot. actors josh hartnett and chris klein i also give a 10 for having a cute face.

this is a very unusual film which starts out with a rich dude getting a brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take it for a spin in the local town. rich boy meets poor girl in 'mabels diner'who is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out. there is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the rich boy and poor boy wind up having to do community service as ordered by the town judge. rich boy and poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend. there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. poor girl says, "some people go through life and never find love, i can say that i found love and am holding on to it". you will need some tissue's if you are sensitive, there are plenty of romantic scenes and i doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end. the producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film. if you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your film.

one of the message boards threads at imdb had two women talking about colin firth, how they watched the movie only because of him. obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally. the brilliant, and i mean brilliant, performances by michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange were hardly noticed, not only by audiences, but by the academy and by most of the critics.i think i know why. first, the plot--or actually just the setup--is a kind of bastardization of shakespeare's king lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit. their names even begin with the same letters, regan, goneril, and cordelia--rose, ginny, and caroline. and i guess "larry" (jason robards) works for "lear." the apparent idea envisioned by jane smiley in her pulitzer prize winning novel was to tell a lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the bard. the problem is, in smiley and moorhouse's story, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities. his only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it.the second problem--and this is one i cannot personally attest to, not having read smiley's novel--is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. still, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen. the vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist. given five or six hours, perhaps moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with smiley's novel.a third problem is one that is perhaps moorhouse's alone. she began her directing career with the very well done aussie film proof (1991) starring russell crowe. she follow it up with how to make an american quilt (1995) which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. however it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick. in a sense a thousand acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. larry cook is clearly a bad, bad daddy. he beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them. he ran the household with an iron fist. jess (colin firth's character) seduces the inexperienced ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear. and then he goes to rose, who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership, and hooks up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. the rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, the way they often appear in romance novels. i think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story.having said all this, i think the critics and the public are wrong. i think the direction was biased against men, but in this story it needed to be. i think moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty. and the acting by pfeiffer and lange was nothing short of sensational. they seemed to feed off of one another in a way that i found absolutely authentic and deeply moving. in particular pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent-up anger and hatred. the way moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to pfeiffer's outstanding performance. and the skill with which moorhouse guided the change in ginny's character as she went from a "ninny," as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. the fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else. he needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back. and robards in his intensity and madness was also very good.i predict that this film, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on dvd. my question is, whatever happened to moorhouse? her talent is obvious, but she has yet to director her fourth feature film. when she does i hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well. i think, actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film, but didn't pay enough attention to the others. in addition to the unnuanced father, jennifer jason leigh's caroline was unfinished, leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did. and the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins. they needed to be engaged and involved.

there are other movies about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff, but "the belles of st. trinian's" towers above them all! the plot has been thoroughly summarized by other posters, so i won't cover the same ground. i just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally out on dvd, but in a format that can't be used in the u.s.! :-( enjoy, fellow fans in new zealand and australia! and if anyone reading this has any pull in such matters, please help get it released on dvd with region 1 encoding! also, is it possible to be notified via e-mail when (i won't say "if") it is released on dvd in the united states? thanks!

alistair simms is a wonder in this. he makes such a good headmistress. the role given here for george cole was made for him. hence, the casting job on this film was perfect. i think it was one of those rare occasions where everything clicked. the story line was good, the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a delight!! each character you are endeared to, even the villains. why can't we make films like this any more. basically, this is a very english comedy with good movement and fluidity.

this bright hilarious english comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem. the significant question is where is the audience? the film is rated 10 by most voters, but how many voters is that? they don't make comedies like this anymore because the films don't get distributed or seen. i would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again. but where are the art houses?

this comic classic of english school girl antics is and was one of the great art house classics. then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos. and so did the audience for this movie. the loss is not to the art houses or to this great film. the loss is to those who will never have a real opportunity to view this memorable laugh filled cinematic masterpiece. but i am preaching to the converted aren't i. who else would search for this flick?

the first of five st trinian's films (although the last is usually discounted) was based around artist ronald searle's schoolgirl characters, and features the wonderful alastair sim in drag as millicent fritton, headmistress, as well as her own brother. much of the humour is dated, yet curiously touching and outrageous in today's pc world - the girls drink, gamble, smoke and are later sold off to rich arabs, yet always remain in charge, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other establishment figures as they maraud across england. perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on tv, st trinians still inspires fancy dress parties and club nights. the films have recurring characters that include pc ruby gates (joyce grenfell) and flash harry (george cole). the precursor to the entire series is a charming film called 'the happiest days of your life' (1950).

so udo kier earned like nine bucks and free food for this so that is a victory in and of itself. more importantly this movie tells a very interesting tale about a group of salvage guys coming across the broken down demeter. i should warn you, i'm gunna bounce around through this review real quick so buckle up. first thing's first. coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 finds a bunch of caskets on board and... now i don't know anything about the future but maybe they smuggle drugs in caskets. not gunna say that was the craziest thing in this movie. later on the vampire gets out of his mist filled coffin and then the real hilarity begins. first, although this movie has the word dracula in it he is actually not in this movie. i have a theory though. out of the blue you see the salvage crew's ship leave without them. my theory is that dracula was on board with his retarded brother orlock. dracula told orlock he'll be right back. dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving orlock to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he is in the movie. the best part of this film, and for those of you that have seen this you know what i'm gunna say, is after 187 gets sired, embraced whatever. he has this huge monologue about ejaculating on various parts of erika elaniak's body and... other super cool stuff. coolio, seriously you are the best thing ever. some other stuff happens in this movie too. like casper van dean gets some work. orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we kinda lose track of him for the rest of the movie. and thank god really. we find out erika's character is a police bot. as the movie comes to a close we find out that the ship is on a course to ram into the sun. the police bot and one other surviving character are doomed. rather then avoid certain death erika's police bot reveals she's also a whore bot and they decide to screw each other and die. before they die in the sun they die for no reason, yep that's right... their ship blows up for no real reason. this movie got the amazing rating for one reason, coolio. my god, if they gave academy awards to black rappers then he'd be the first to get one. the only reason this didn't get a perfect ten is because there was not a drop of nudity. now i know what your thinking, how can you judge a film by whether ladies show their goods or not. well easy. a movie like this pretty much requires it. its part of the process. gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of movie final shock at the end. its the formula. this had some gore, the monster was awesome because he sucked so hard he actually did us the favor of staying off camera. that was considerate of him and i respect that. nudity, not a drop even though there was a length conversation about... well see the above statement and as for the shock/twist... i certainly didn't see the end coming. that counts. i hope hollywood doesn't think coolio gave this film his all and has nothing left. he deserves more work. well, until dracula 4000, i'm out.

i rented this movie not knowing what to expect but whoa was i in for a treat!for anyone who, like myself, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it is time to rejoice because the wait has finally ended. writing, acting, filming and directing - all top notch. i hate to admit it, but i actually cried at one point (when dracula was talking to the crippled guy). truly an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish. the corridors of the ship provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale and the actors were really able to make their fear come alive to me. and coolio as a vampire....very nice!and believe me....as great as the bulk of the movie was...the ending will blow you away! i know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason but i know none of you saw the ending coming. brilliant!

unfortunately, many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores "adjusted" by imdb. this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde, little big man, night moves, mickey one, and the chase.if you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the actual median for four friends is 7.6. however, imdb has "adjusted" (dumbed down?) the rating to 6.4.per imdb: "imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at 'vote stuffing' by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it....the exact methods we use will not be disclosed. this should ensure that the policy remains effective." in other words, we won't disclose our methods, so you can't question how we arrived at the score! what a shame to see fine thought-provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb's "filters".

four friends was first billed on hbo in 82 as a sleeper hit. having heard the term 'sleeper' when 14, back then - i was anxious to see one. (!) boy - was i surprised! that film! i hadn't really fallen in love with a non-special effects film outside of treasure of the sierra madre - much less a 'hippy flick'...but having had grown up with a couple of hippies - i understood the power behind mr. penn's film. four friends is definitely one of a kind. the script is so personable - and that cast!!! craig wasson defines danilo prozor so well! he just personifies the 'writer type' to a tee - both smart and clumsy (the scene at the window...) and strong yet so very vulnerable. for me - he captures what it's like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decade...and i have always found solace in the character - and in the film. throughout the 80's four friends was a partner in crime to me - and i caught the movie whenever i could on hbo - even if i had to stay up until 5am! and still, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach. jodi thelen personifies "that girl" to the hilt - it is so hard not to be charmed by her. this movie really stands the test of time. every once and a while i check out my video of it...or show a friend...and it still gets a solid reaction. i've known women who absolutely fall in love with georgia! so many levels..! just an incredible little 60's piece of humanity. very special, very magical. i recently found the novelization of four friends by robert grossbach - and it's even more detailed that the movie! actual dates of events, etc. a real find! and what's more - haha - i found the novel while thumbing around in a used book store...in omaha, ne of all places!!! guess you have to have an eye for her! when i was in l.a. in 92 working as an extra - i went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop - and there were a ton of stills from the film!!! unfortunately - i was broke and couldn't indulge...but boy, those photos of georgia and the guys all together just went right through me! i met director joe sergant on the set of skylark in emporia, ks in summer of 92...and we spoke about four friends - very cool! also...working at a video store in omaha in 98 - waited on a female who was a relative of jim metzler..! told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in omaha who was just fanatical about the film - and had gotten the utmost out of it. once again - the movie captures everything that's in danilo's character's heart...great, great work --- one of mssrs tesich and penn's finest efforts. steve tesich is sorely missed. an incredible writer. "isadora duncan!!!"- c.

four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations, only to find yourself knocked for a loop. you sort of file it away, but then you hear the song "georgia on my mind" by ray charles, and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry, almost at the same time.why is this film so memorable? first, at least for people who lived through it all, because it captures so well the tenor of the times - its dashed hopes, its successes, its sincerity and above all the emotional roller-coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia. and then, the acting is just so amazing. danilow, all angst and passion, georgia, as difficult to grasp as a will 'o the wisp... but enchanting, nevertheless, and louis, the handicapped room-mate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile, because he knows only too well that it just might be his last.how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story? even if they were far from perfect? the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable, but the film never moralizes, it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety... even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a history, which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top... because that's the way life is, when you think about it. and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character. truly an amazing and satisfying experience.

i first encountered arthur penn's "four friends" late one night on hbo. having never heard of it, i expected very little, but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of penn and screenwriter steve tesich would be like. for the next two hours or so, i sat mesmerized, watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove. a semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s, "four friends" follows the story of danilo, an eastern european immigrant (the brilliant craig wasson), from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape. accompanying danilo on his journey are his friends georgia (the radiant jodi thelan, in a role that sadly, she has never had the opportunity to equal), tom (jim metzler) and david (michael huddleston). "four friends" covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this film, i urge you to find a copy (it's just been released on dvd) and watch it. you won't be disappointed. tesich's script is wonderfully poignant  at times funny, at times incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. penn directs with a sure hand, and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following. the cast is uniformly superb. this film should have made a major star out of wasson who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents. jodi thelan, not your standard brainless hollywood sexpot, heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film. metzler and huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. also superb are miklos simon and elizabeth lawrence as danilo's parents, as well as reed birney and lois smith. i have not been without a copy of "four friends" since the day after i first saw it on hbo those many years ago. it has been and remains one of my all-time favorite films for more than 20 years now. i can't recommend it enough and feel, if you give it a chance, you'll feel the same way.

this may be one of the best movies i have ever seen. it has anything but a trite plot, and leaves one wondering which way it will go next. it is an interesting portrayal of the struggles of youth, youth who are interested in more than immediate gratification, youth who show some concern about the desires and needs of others.

i haven't seen this film for over 20 years, but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe. this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight shipping and can't wait for it to arrive. it is uplifting at times, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. it's a story of a close-knit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines, rather than watching on a movie screen or television. hard to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life. the entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of jodi thelen's career. i'm hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend.

what a great movie!! it's a touching story about four high-school friends who grow up in the 1960s. throughout the decade, the friends are somewhat separated, but they mnnage to see each other occasionally. there are many tragedies, but there are also a lot of happy moments that make you laugh and smile. it's a heart-filled tale of life, love and friendship. definitely a must see for drama fans.

this is one of the best presentations of the 60's put on film. arthur penn, director of bonnie and clyde and little big man, saw that steve tesich's outstanding script rang with truth, and from these two talents comes solid cinema. jodi thelin's georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps, but, always just out of reach. just see it, or you cinematic education will be incomplete.

behind the nostalgic music, we see a young boy get off a train. he is arriving from yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he has not seen in a decade. at the train station, we meet the man. he never smiles.thus, we begin our journey into "four friends", arthur penn's powerful and amazing film. you may ask why i began my review that way. well, that is the way the video box describes the film. you may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually, he will peel away at his cover and expose the kindness.well, if you bought that, i've got a bridge i want to sell you. you see, modern hollywood would make that film. penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to typical cliched storytelling. he always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "bonnie and clyde", "the chase", "alice's restaurant" and the underrated "mickey one") and "four friends" is no exception.a typical hollywood film would focus on the boy who is named danilo. but steve tesich's script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then abandons him. we meet the adult danilo, played by craig wasson (whom you may recognize from "body double" and "nightmare on elm street 3") and his friends, tom, david and the passionate georgia. the movie takes us throughout the sixties. now in a lesser film, the events would receive the attention. but in "four friends", these events happen, but penn and tesich is more concerned with character study than plot and i think the film is better that way. we know the events; we don't need to dwell on them again.i know i haven't described much of the plot, but i don't know if you can describe "four friends". it's not one of those "high-concept" films that can be described in a single sentence. it's a film of many moods and textures. it's also a genuinely emotional experience. the final twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears. i'm not ashamed to admit it. rarely does a film have such power that it can reduce me to tears. the acting is first rate, especially by craig wasson, who seems to be one of the most underused actors working today. this is such a difficult, emotional performance and wasson pulls it off. he should have received an oscar for this. another great performance is by jodi thelen, who has an even more difficult role than wasson. but she handles it extremely well and gives georgia a certain dignity most hollywood actresses wouldn't (they'd be too scared to even try; they'd be more concerned with image rather than giving a great performance; that's not what acting is about). she also deserved an oscar."four friends" didn't receive much of a push in 1981. maybe people just didn't have the emotional capacity to handle it. and clueless executives couldn't push it as another "american graffiti" (it lacks the wallop of "four friends"). so they let it die. too bad, for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s, a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home. i ask you to give this film a chance.**** out of 4 stars

someone definitely has it in for the wind and i cannot believe that what i saw on the screen has much to do with it. this is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents i watch all year long. the cinematography displays a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the casting was just fine. i would love to see more of these folks, especially zeke rippy.as far as the story and script, i'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing anybody else about the movie. the long drawn out nit-picky bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer, are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film. i don't know the inside story, but it would probably make a good movie. what i do know from being around this biz, is, productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts, drive and common sense to "kill the babies", someone always ends up with hurt feelings. that's part of the biz too, and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business. of course, the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them (read: were honest and truthful with them). and that is my best guess to explain the nasty, nasty reviews. in as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that they become obviously fictitious.it's not a slasher blood bath if that's what you're looking for, it's more the psychological suspense thriller, which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there. the best way to see this movie is to try to expunge any pre-conceived notions, pop it in and let it unfold - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say, i don't think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed. poorly understood perhaps.overall, i do agree that this is a nicely done, compelling movie. perhaps i would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances, but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture (i have a secret love for really bad cinema). to me, the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shlocky, inept, poorly acted and stupidly written movies. none of that applies here - it is quality movie making with some real talent in there. i gave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct direction. watch the movie and tell me i am wrong.

during the civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated confederate ladies' school; where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about, until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. the soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it all comes at a price in the end. "dirty harry (1971)" (which was made about the same time of "the beguiled") might be my favourite collaboration between eastwood and siegel, but after seeing this, i tend to think this to be the pairs' finest work together. a very atypical, savvy and stylish vehicle for eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by don siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by lalo schifrin. standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity. it's assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension. the way siegel illustrates john b sherry and grimes grice's alluring bold, slow-burn screenplay (taken from the novel of thomas cullinan) is effectively done through stark emotions and the script's tight, lyrical context. siegel's strong direction captures the idyllically southern victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained. while the performances, are truly commendable and high of quality. clint eastwood as the smoothly suave, sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. a profoundly eminent geraldine page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant elizabeth hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character. mae mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and jo ann harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. honestly while eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs, there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played (where rivalry between the women creep in) turn out to be no better than their guest at the end. throughout there's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material. what's demonstrated here, is simply more than your basic little minded shocker, but one that's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake. that also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song. a effectively chilling, low-key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging hospitality.

let us assume for a moment that you haven't experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and you're wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself out well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of the beguiled. see, with film you have your clean trips (solaris and anything else directed by andrei tarkovsky), whack trips, i.e. the experience-from-which-you-never-recover (sweet movie and el topo), and you're bad organic trips, a category specifically reserved for a film like the beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the harvard department of english refer to as "hallucinogenic in tone." by the third act of this don siegel directed movie, you may not exactly observe that your two lead-heavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal, nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age, but you will feel something.in 1970, when this film was filmed, most americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain, a movie like the graduate perhaps, a lot of world-endism was going on and, of course you had the nightmare break down of war in vietnam. what you get with the beguiled, banal drug metaphors aside, is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as grimes grice, and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of sam peckinpah. in the beguiled, donny siegel, born in 12, chicago, il., less than 45 years after the great fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970's in the form of a classical film artifact. the beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: the shooting, editing, direction and story are all fantastic, and you're not likely to see anything else like it. undoubtedly, a sinister film, its effects, as i've said, both dizzying and adulterating; frankly it's hard to believe would ever universal attached its name to this picture, but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet, sweet camera moves, and cinematographer bruce surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the american plantation south, conflating beauty with evil in every location shot. clint eastwood, needless to say, has never been like this. old clint, he moves at instant from coy to livid, his eyes like two archimedean spirals in medium close up. the rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncanny.this beguiled will never make the afi 100 in my lifetime, but that doesn't stop me from positing that it's one of the best american synch sound films ever made. while most people catalogue it as a western, to include the folks at the western channel, the beguiled is a problem because you don't really know what it is: a sort of war movie? a drama? psychological thriller? maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought noir films starring kirk douglas? i actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man, who likes to kick back with the cheap, gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like the wire, saw that high angle medium long shot of geraldine page wrapping a tourniquet around clint's bloody leg, pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the outback bowl, right before he absconded to another room. my advice: watch this one, and make sure it is on a very large screen, preferably run on that dpl home theater projector you're contemplating. i would put the beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase, turn the overheads out, throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall, and try not to lose your grip because just like norman bates, "we all go a little mad sometimes," even the beguiled.

the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today. and from it's opening sepia-tinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled. too many film-makers these days substitute special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera-work in place of character-driven stories, but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and compelling.the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war. the south-supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier (clint eastwood); nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends.geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed. for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest. there's even a chance that the normal status quo, long abandoned when eastwood's machinations are uncovered, could return; but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road...this is a totally different style of film from the same director's dirty harry, made in the same year, and yet they are both equally superb. eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, yet there's also some mysterious quality attached to his character. we never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration, and the viewer is free to decide upon his well-shaded persona. villain or victim? whatever you think, all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it.

this film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971.clint eastwood, geraldine page, and elizabeth hartman do excellent work in the film, as do all the cast members.set during the civil war, the film begins when a wounded yankee soldier, johnny, portrayed by clint eastwood, is given refuge and help at a girls academy located in the south.the headmistress of the school, ms. farnsworth (geraldine page), the one teacher-edwina (elizabeth hartman), and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too long.while their loyalties lay with the confederacy-- their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women over to his side--and keep them from turning him over to the patrollers.however, feelings previously stoked by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, a brutal rape, and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousies--turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both johnny and the school's residents.10 stars

i was amazed about this early performance of clint eastwood. i had not read a summary of the film, when i decided to watch it on tv. due to mr. eastwood, i expected some nice shootings and no deep story. i was quite mistaken. i found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed, and until the end, i couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad. this movie is definitely not typical eastwood, but surely worth watching.

this is a good movie, i won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that. however, i disagree with the statement that this is eastwood's best work. that is just not a very defendable position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in. i would like to note that i find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, pattye mattick and peggy drier, never again appeared in another film or television show, in spite of giving good performances. my curiosity has me wondering what happened to these two actresses?

i thought that eastwood's most unusual role was that in the bridges of madison county, but that was until i saw the beguiled. he manages to pull it off, giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast. the direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and had there not been some plot holes - which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times - we would be talking about an excellent film. it remains powerful, nonetheless.8

probably this is the best film of clint eastwood. here action is minimal, but with plenty of good acting. a yankee soldier eastwood is wounded and taken by the female pupils and teachers of a school in the south, where he is hidden and taken care. shortly after his recovery all ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them succeeded including the director of the school(geraldine page). erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their "macho" was shared by several of them, so they became angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner. geraldine page, although somewhat old, was able to play a very suggestive role as the director of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.

a tough life gets tougher when the three children of a single mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely passing.to stay together, the older boy plans a daring, high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle- their only remaining next of kin.their trek takes the three fearful runaways on a chase through the desert in a classic beetle, penniless, hungry, desperate, terrorized by delinquents and too young to drive, hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities.what the movie lacks in acting and plot realism, it makes up for in the honest human need to be a part of a fulfilled and complete family- even if that family is cobbled together with spare parts of broken lives.sure, the ending is forced and too over-dramatic for the critical movie goer, but every heart beats the same cry for family togetherness and belonging.with all its weaknesses, i still give this movie a strong recommendation.

this 1955 producers' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast, including kathleen nolan as wendy, who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play. it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn't even show up in the imdb listings when you put "peter pan" into the search engine! - is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched. i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally. now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison. i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b/w producers' showcase televised version.as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo. how far away the 1950's seem now - such an innocent time compared to today. i miss it.

finally i discovered what i thought i remembered as a four year old. after seeing the 1960 color version on vhs, i kept saying i remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before. now the imdb has helped me to know the truth, that it was broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years, 1955 & 56. these are the ones i remember best as a four year old. i didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55. in 1960, i was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me. the black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today, even without any computer effects. you had to have been there! please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b&w version.

considered by many to be a strangely overlooked chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor. not as overtly sexy, violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour. ms audran, not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother, donald pleasence does a cameo as a child molester, david hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother, sister and niece. no not very nice at all and chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal (like it might be in some small french village!) instead of ed mcbain's new york city. had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film. here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement. very watchable

evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a sombre donald sutherland, and potent support roles from donald pleasence and david hemming. the material decides to keep it all glum, and moves from the investigation period into the back-story of the victim. the seldom, and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in, but when it flashback to the victim's side showing her final days weren't as compelling, and became somewhat stodgy and stock-like. while the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along, however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone-jarring and it's not helped out by its sloppy execution. howard blake's music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger, and director claude chabrol's capable handling (well for most part) has a strong stylistic and tight manner, which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast. the young faces lisa langlois and aude landry do an incredibly good job as well.

i honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated. claude chabrol could be described as something like a french alfred hitchcock, and while this film is only the second one of his that i've seen (the first being le boucher), i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films. the film is a french and canadian co-production, and takes place in canada. the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film; most of which is high quality also. the film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station. after being questioned by inspector carella, it emerges that the young girl, patricia, and her sister muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed patricia to flee. however, as the investigation goes on, patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence, which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer.the performances in this film are excellent. donald sutherland is subdued as usual, but he suits the role he's given here very well and i wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in blood relatives as one of his very best. the film also features supporting turns from british stars donald pleasance and david hemmings who both give good turns; pleasance in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in halloween films. the unknown aude landry also gives a great performance in her role as patricia. the movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked. when inspector carella discovers muriel's diary, the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl's last actions are shown; and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it, it's still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end! overall, blood relatives is a great film that really deserves to be better seen. le boucher is a better known effort from chabrol, but for my money this is at least as good! highly recommended viewing.

when patricia newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder,detective carrella searches the city for her killer.identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt,patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country.for carrella the case is closed...or is it?"blood relatives" is an overlooked masterpiece.donald sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see donald pleasance in a small role as a child molester.the conclusion is pretty disturbing.still "blood relatives" is more of a mystery than a horror film,so fans of gore will be disappointed.a must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.

eisenstein's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the russians under alexander nevsky defeated the livonian knights, eager to bring russia under roman catholicism. made in 1938, nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the nazis. the butchery by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of world war ii. the film ends with a warning: those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword. made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked eisenstein's return to official favor. by the late 1920s, stalin wanted soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the russian public. that stopped eisenstein's career in russia for a decade, and in nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid in the screen. another strong point is prokofiev's beautiful, haunting soundtrack (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time). one of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simpleton russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian peasant) is really jarring.

a very good film, focusing on a very important issue. fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. if more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not end up like adam. jimmie smits performs in one of his best roles ever. this is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. this is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the united states today. there are children struggling with this world wide. the really important point here is that it all could have been prevented. more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously. it is well done, with important messages, handled in a graceful way.

this was a excellent movie. i deal with a child who i am raising that has fae and watching this movie was more than word can explain. i also purchased the book and it was great. i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my son's teachers watch it also.i would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it. thank you, myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability's. this movie should be shown again on tv. the team of doctor's that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy. his special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrow.thank you

this movie was everything but boring. it deals with reality. to the people who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems in our society. our children are dying. the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored. i work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor,and i deal with these problems every day. people of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. it destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage,all kinds of health problems, and death. it is all preventable. this movie should be shown in every high-school in the world. if anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it, or sell me a copy, please e-mail me at: ottenbreit2@netzero.net thank you

i think this is the best norwegian movie i've ever seen. it's about 40-year old andreas who gets hit by a subway-train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, however, everything here has been made ready for him. he has got a job, a house and clothes. at first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect. however andreas can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world, and tries with all means to get back. the thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic, even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant. another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors. trond fausa aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome andreas. and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic (sounds like a hard job, doesn't it?). the strong difference between andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. all in all, this is a fabulous movie. the plot may be a little confusing, but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it. and i wouldn't recommend listening to "ccscd212", as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate. the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong. i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking. but sure, everyone can see a film in their own way.

totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it. this movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way. what it is about? estrangement, i believe. probably up to the viewer, but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. don't know if i'm right. but this movie really got to me. see it. i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style. and i forgot: the casting here i superb, with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why. the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city), is what makes him bothersome. all the others do as they are told, and pretend (?) to be happy. this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.

i heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie but he himself would describe it as mental horror. i strongly subscribe to that.it is not clear why he travels to this place, but everything there is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. our "hero" though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself. what makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays. you have to function, you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses, you show off on your wealth, your car, etc., and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have. naturally, in this film you see neither children nor old people - they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers.i would recommend this film to everyone - and make sure that this utopia does not come true!

imagine a world, in which everyone treats anyone nicely, no foul word is ever uttered, office bickering is nonexistent, and your boss invites the office crowd regularly to self-cooked dinners where you can chat about latest interior design styles. everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. in other words: you are in hell. after being dropped off in the middle of nowhere, mid-thirties andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) starts a new job as a book-keeper in a small, clean city. from the beginning he feels foreign in this proper, impersonal world of superficial kindness, surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and likewise colleagues. food tastes of nothing, drinks don't get you drunk, no children anywhere; after initial steps of fitting in, andreas searches for ways to escape the bland new world. he doesn't know where he came from anymore, but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - anything beyond the non-committal flatline life he's leading now. the bothersome man resonates ideas of huxley and kafka, but here the cruelty is the omnipresent noncommittal neatness. unlike pleasantville this is not about narrow-minded bigotry, more a fable of our urban free-world civilisation of fitting in. it mostly reminds one of the ingenious fight club scene, in which edward norton walks through a mock-ikea catalogue. spiced with macabre humour, this scandinavian laconic tale convinces on every level: story, characters, and relevance. a true screen gem. 8/10

andreas arrives in a strange city. he doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there. he is ordered to arrive at work, and gets his own apartment in the city. all his co-workers are nice and polite to him, they say hi and smile when they pass by him. but then later on andreas discovers that the city isn't that pleasant as it seems. going home from work, he see some people wearing grey suits, cleaning up the bloody mess of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim that had thrown himself out of the window. the procedure is done with a calmed mind, as if they were emptying a trashcan. the following day, andreas meets the suicide victim fully alive at work. more and more andreas discovers the feelingless atmosphere of the city.den brysomme mannen might be the best norwegian film i've seen. original, artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. the plot is also very original, and could even be called post-modern horror, as the film present us a terrifying thought of having to cope with a world that is completely feelingless. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. i am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a disembovled universe, a nightmare, that you simply cannot escape from, not even with death.go see it, its really worth it! i gave it 9 out of 10.

i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie. i agree, the director it's not kuprik, the actors are not oscar winners, but it has something everyone could relate to. i don't want to spoil but telling more then the plot - the finishing of school and the trip to a big party, or if you like to see beyond the metaphor, is choosing the way trough life. remember that days of youth? the days when you or our friend acted like the characters? or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didn't? if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of this questions maybe the movie wasn't so bad.

despite its age, this film retains its undoubted charm and attraction, and is a fine, surviving example of early british cinema. it has an underlying air of eeriness, interspersed with shafts of humour which are not out of place, and serve to demonstrate the assured direction & production values involved. so many episodic type films are disjointed and untidy, but this is not one of them. the standard of acting helps a great deal, and the various disparate characters come across as interesting and believable. all in all, this long-forgotten little gem is well worth anyone's attention, in spite of the one jarring note in the film which, surprisingly, escaped the censor's attention!

this is an exceptional film. it is part comedy, part drama, part suspense. the dialog is exquisite. most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time, and for good reason. you will probably recognize someone, even if you don't usually watch older movies. they are also each in a role that particularly suits their talents. one correction to make on another users comment is that two people, not one, are announced to die in the accident. maybe the unlucky two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. the movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens.the story is ahead of its time, but it does not lose the quality of an older movie. time and effort was spent perfecting the camera's view and the soundtrack, something modern movie makers tend to forget.

this movie pops up now and again on the abc in australia at about 3 am in the morning.it starts off with the scene of a bus crash in london.the films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses, plus the lapsed photography of big ben winding back, to symbolise what events occurred thirteen hours ago, up until the bus crash.it took me a while to understand it, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.if sean cunningham and quentin tarrantino got together and made a film, this may be the result - due to the flashbacks and small stories tying in, and deaths.i am unsure of the main characters, as it has been a while since i have seen it, but a rare gem indeed.

it has been years since i have been privileged to see this movie on tv. i only wish i could contact someone to see it again. i married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. i didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how i can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. my step-son is now 35 and thank the lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother. we speak every month to rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol. please please let me know how i can get a copy vhs or dvd of this movie or when they will show the movie again on tv. if you have not been in these shoes, you probably could never understand its value. thank you so very much.

i watched fantabulosa! because over the last few years michael sheen has become one of my favourite actors, and if you haven't seen him in anything before firstly shame on you, and secondly get your hands on a copy of either heartlands or dirty filthy love. this production did not disappoint - michael sheen transformed himself almost magically into kenneth williams, and gave a performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful. not to take anything away from the other performances but like kenneth, michael truly stole the show. i don't know how he does it, but every performance i have seen michael give he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly, utterly believable, and no matter how hard i try i cannot fault him. must go get my tea, enjoy!

a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listening to round the horne or hancock's half hour or watching carry on films. probably the most famous line in comedy "infamy! infamy! they've all got it infamy!" still makes me laugh.this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final quotation from the coroner's court read in four different voices by michael sheen. he was brilliant in the role. most of the other members of the carry on team were so-so and their kenneth horne was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for him.it left me feeling "wow". to quote kenneth williams, to the cynic who says 'life is a joke' the only response can be 'yes, well let's make it a good one.'

i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating. the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. the cast acted superbly, but michael sheen was outstanding. i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment. he looks completely physically different in this role, from any other role i have seen him in or as himself. williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries,as represented in this film. the film is at times distressing to watch, because of the emotional anguish displayed. however, it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly.

watching this ppv, i had high expectations for it, since smackdown is the best show in wwe, this is a very good ppv as it is the last one before wrestlemania.first match-hardy boys & chris benoit vs. mvp & mnm w/ melina in a 6 man tag team match good way to start the match. it started a bit slow at the start, but later the pace quickened & the match got more exciting & entertaining. benoit rolls through & makes joey mercury tap out to get a victory for the hardy boys & himself. 6/10second match- gregory helms {champion} vs. shannon moore vs. funaki vs. chavo guerrero vs. daivairi vs. scotty 2 hotty vs. jamie noble vs. jimmy wang yang in an open cruiserweight invitational match for the wwe cruiserweight championship i'm a very big fan of cruiserweights, & i never get disappointed watching them, especially in this match here. chavo guerrero nails the frog splash on jimmy wang yang to get the win & become the new wwe cruiserweight champion. 5/10third match- finlay & little bastard vs. boogeyman & little boogeyman this was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. finlay nails the little boogeyman with the shillaegh to get the win. boogeyman does not deserve to be on a ppv, & does not deserve to be in wwe. 4/10fourth match- kane vs. king booker w/ sharmell this was a surprisingly good match, i thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest. hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. kane wins after a chokeslam on king booker. 6/10fifth match- paul london & brian kendrick {champions} vs. deuce & domino w/ cherry for the wwe tag team championships not really that much of a good match, deuce & domino need more training to wrestle, & london & kendrick are the only ones keeping this match fast paced. london & kendrick retain their titles, after kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the guys for the win. 4/10sixth match- bobby lashley {champion} vs. mr. kennedy for the ecw championship mr. kennedy attacks lashley from behind, before the match starts. it was an okay match, but not really good. lashley & kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to pull a great match. kennedy wins by dq, after lashley nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area. lashley still retains his title. 4/10seventh match- john cena & shawn michaels vs. batista & undertaker this is probably the greatest tag team match that i have ever seen. hats off to all of these men {yes even batista} for pulling off as close as a 5 star main event classic. all 4 of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very great & entertaining tag team match. batista turns his back on undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the ring, which prompts michaels to nail sweet chin music, then cena to nail an f-u for the hard fought victory. 7/10i don't know why everyone says that this ppv is not good enough, or it is boring, i just don't get it. it is a great ppv which smackdown always delivers. a great ppv indeed.overall i'll give it 8/10 & a b+

every time the supposed explorers and we , the audience, is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds, for some ungodly reason, the filmmakers decided to distract with an "emergency" or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense. so instead of calmly enjoying the surface of io, or standing over the rings of saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid, we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters. big let down !!!!the filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want. a documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system, or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter. come on. hello. if i wanted suspense and tension i'd watch a real narrative sci-fi movie. sure it's a docu-drama. but the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - should be secondary to the subject matter ). wait. yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter - since essentially this is a film about a space mission , not just about the solar system. but it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying. otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission , the squabbles, the tensions, the weight of responsibility, the near-fatal mistakes, the sacrifices , etc. also it would fit very well in the hard-sci-fi subgenre - in fact it would be one of the best , because here the science was almost closely adhered to. but the distractions were awful. otherwise, i missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts after landing on earth. also not

my main criticism is quite simply that it isn't long enough or detailed enough. i would have loved to see more of everything: the building of the vessel, the engineering, the training, the first lift to orbit, preparations for departure, venus orbital injection, everything. i would have liked to see more of the first leg, venus to earth, instead of zipping there like a n°10 corporation bus. in fact, i would have liked to see a series on the scale of earth story made of this, with a full hour dedicated to every planet and maybe another to the loop around the sun. as it was, i was left hungry. on the other hand, i do understand budgets and viewers' attention-spans.re the science: let's be fair about the speed-of-light time-lag: they did mention at the beginning that there was a lag in conversations, but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets. some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers, and we have to assume that the lag was edited out for the sake of palatability; so no complaints there. but zero for noisy spaceships. the only film in which spaceships make no noise was kubrick's 2001, and even then he copped out by using the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets - which *was* pretty effective. i wish the makers of space odyssey had realized just how eerie the sight of vast rocket-motors blasting in absolute silence might be but alas, pegasus lets out much the same roar as every other cardboard spaceship in every other cardboard scifi film.but the rest of the science was excellent. no complaints there, in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did. i just hope that having done this film won't discourage the bbc from making a really detailed version, but i suppose that's not for next week or next year either...

i strongly recommend it to anybody who likes good plots, good actors (even if not well known)(often, it's just better that way), science and/or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on the (small) screen, good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it... much better than any war in the stars...there was only one comment which was not necessary: talking about the comet, the commentator says that life was maybe brought on earth through a comet... that's fun, there must be always a chance for a magic way, huh?! that's what's great about life, can come anywhere, no need of extern force

1 let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could, might or ought know "how it is" or "ought to be" there in space. human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages maps are compared to today's satellite maps, so we really have no clue. 2 considering this is "just" a bbc tv docu-simulation, it gets much better than many big budget hollywood blockbusters, and that is just incredible. 3 all in all, a show worth watching as it portrays the cgi enhanced and fictionalized account of what we know of the solar system this far. 4 probably fictionalizing and cgi-ing the whole thing is the only way to make it palatable to a large public. ever watched clips from real space missions and real space probes? the quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x-ray (and what it tells about the human body ) and compare it with a cgi-ed cyborg movie...which one would be most entertaining? yet the chest x-ray is real, while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized sfx. 5 actors do a good job. none i'll tell my grandchildren about, but very fair for it being a bbc docu-simulation.

i'd first heard of this show in 2005, first online and then by viewing (and of course, buying)the typically gorgeous, bbc tie-in book. then i got the dvd; it did not disappoint! i'd been hoping for years someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, laser gun fights and other hollywood 'boogieman' gimmicks! thank you, joe ahearne (also for your dr. who work, and ultraviolet--the mini-series; not the crap movie of the same name)! what compelled me to write this now (2 yrs. later) was that i'd just seen sunshine last night. and what appeared to be in the same family as space odyssey turned into (about 2/3rds of the way in) freddy krueger meets 2010! that was when space odyssey really stood out as a positive example of how to do a real science fiction film; more science, less fiction! odyssey (like sunshine) also dealt with astronaut shortcomings (zoe's failed eva, ivan's over exertions on venus, the spats with mission control) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers (the fatal radiation spike on mars). i would've easily paid to see this in a theater (i-max, anyone?). and to top it all, not only were the space vistas jaw droppingly beautiful, but the characters were nicely drawn, too. i found their interplay more realistic than the wall-slamming histrionics of sunshine's icarus 2 crew (icarus; dumb name for a solar mission--did anyone read the mythology of icarus??). sometimes it takes a not-so-good film to compel one to re-watch a better film. as an armchair astronaut, i'd trade my passage on icarus for a seat on pegasus any day. in all fairness, however, the visuals of sunshine are quite stunning, though, and quite memorable. which is why i was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honest-to-goodness sci-fi film. so, even though this review is almost a back-door review of sunshine, i hope it's read for what it was meant to be; strong support for a bbc telefilm that succeeds where most big-budget, bloated cinematic spectacles fail. space odyssey (a.k.a. voyage to the planets here in the states) whets the appetite for solid, science-fiction and delivers a banquet. i very much enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach as well. as for the time lag/light-speed quibbles, they are addressed, if you pay attention. where sunshine melts, odyssey keeps its cool. if you're considering going to the movies for another dose of sunshine, stay in; go for a true space odyssey instead!

charlie wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. this movie is of the highest quality and is cast perfectly. tom hanks play the lead and delivers an exceptional performance. furthermore, tom hanks is complimented by the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible philip seymour hoffman. i have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly.the film is witty, intelligent and well written. julia roberts also stars in this film but is easily over-shadowed by the other two leads.i rated this film 10/10 and am pleased to recommend this film to anyone that is interested in quality cinema.

it's possible to have a good time with this film while, at the same time, regretting all that it isn't. in the 1980s, a raffish u.s. congressman (tom hanks) engineers support for afghan partisans resisting the soviet union.hanks is in breezy, hail-fellow-well-met form as roguish, politically incorrect charlie wilson, first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women. if only the film had the same air of insouciance; but apart from philip seymour hoffman's turn as a cynical cia agent, it tries to be perceived as patriotic too. aaron sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of wilson's tall tales. and there's an oddly unspoken subtext: wilson's afghan pals later mutated into the taliban and other anti-western groups, leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred.

well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse. it did have some good parts too it that i was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though.first off the acting was above average. i love phillip seymour hoffman in this movie and i liked tom hanks. hoffman was the glue to this movie. if it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom. his performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary. he gave a good witty, cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a cliché. tom hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress. what i could not stand was that julia roberts was involved in this movie. she was as big of a miscast as i have ever seen. for one she is a bad actress, at least to me, she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing.the directing was average to me. i'm not really a big fan of the recent mike nichols movies and i'm not exactly impressed by this one either. it was made with such a hollywoodish, cartoonish touch hat i could not stand. the worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end. i love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie. that is something that mike nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record.the one impressive part of this movie was the writing. the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out. the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level. in so many scenes i found myself laughing in part by the writing.well that is some of what we saw at least. a lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what i mean but not a lot other than that. i did like that this movie did not glorify everything america had done. it is obvious that during this whole war in afghanistan the u.s. gave weapons to the people who are now against us. this movie kind of show we are too blame for that. it shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future. this movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right. overall though it was entertaining.

nice to see a comedy for grown ups. masterfully structured by aaron sorkin via mike nichols's own mastery. mr nichol's mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in "who's afraid of virginia woolf" to the sad and riveting julia roberts, clive owen, jude law and natalie portman in "closer". in "charlie wilson's war" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks, julia roberts, philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. amy adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount, beautifully. it is philip seymour hoffman's gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us. someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. hoffman is superb. the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions. a sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that?

aaron sorking raises the same questions as shakespeare did or does. how could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life. here like in the west wing, sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears. everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. a puffy tom hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and julia roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines. the subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. philip seymour hoffman, as the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like charles laughton did in every movie he was in.the dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. the seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the mike nichol's collection.

this movie was amazing!!!! from beginning to end, the movie is packed with fun, laughs, music, enjoyable rock music, hot chicks, more music, action, drama, and the f-bomb.although some scenes are entirely bizarre and unfitting, they were fun to watch and enjoyable. all in all this movie left you feeling great and happy. especially those that love rock music.the soundtrack is great, the laughs are plentiful, and the storyline is simple, entertaining, yet complex. you have to see this movie if you love rock music!overall vote: 10 out of 10!

if you are like me and you bought the new tenacious d album the day it came out, and went into the film knowing all the lyrics to all the songs....then you will certainly enjoy this film. yes i am biased as a huge tenacious d fan, but i really did like this film which made me chuckle quite a lot.this movie was pretty much everything i expected. comedic genius backed up by great songwriting and some great cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins. i particularly enjoyed tim robbins' part.if, however, you are unfamiliar with tenacious d's hbo series and fantastic debut album, then this may not have quite the same comedic impact on you. i would still recommend you go and watch that because it still worth every cent of the admission price and will make you smile even if you aren't in stitches the whole time.

i managed to see the mtv premiere of this movie last night and i needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the d as it has plenty of in-jokes for those that have seen the hbo series and has more than enough d for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-be converts. the music really shines with the new songs "kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "master exploder" (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and "dude (i totally miss you)". there are a load of excellent scenes (the car chase, the rock-off, the meeting) and cameos (including dave grohl as satan!). i really could go on for hours but i don't want to give the movie away. go see it. you won't be disappointed.

i was able to see a preview of this movie through ucla's pre-screening program, and let me tell you: this movie is unbelievably good!!!! i have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one. i had a decent respect for tenacious d before seeing the movie, and now i am mad about them. i will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again.if you were on the fence about seeing this movie, get off and go see it!! it is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days, as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing.aside from the comedy, the glorious and divine music that flows from kg's guitar and jb's voice is awe inspiring. the audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous (and hilarious) lyrics. if for nothing other than the music itself, this movie is worth the price of admission.with a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional "d" history and hallmarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some pretty awesome cameos, this movie ranks up there with the best! go see it!!

i saw the d's new film tonight at a special advance screening, and i was so blown away by its sheer greatness that i felt i had to come onto imdb and get the word out. admittedly, i was already a huge fan of the d's work - i loved the hbo series and listen to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along to), but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening (for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen). with tenacious d's "the pick of destiny," this is not the case.simply put, this film rocks harder than anything i've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything peter jackson, pixar, and will ferrell together could produce. it tells the story of the d before we came to know them, setting up intriguing histories of kage and jables' upbringings, their comings together, and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as lee, sasquatch, and dio. most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration to the greatest song in the world, "tribute," and how it came to be (which is different than the hbo series' version). after you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it (hence the tribute), but your mind forever be changes by its genius.i don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking, paying outrageous concession prices, etc., but i usually make exceptions when it's starring someone i really love or concerning something of the the same variety. "the pick of destiny" was so good that i have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide, and i plan on convincing all of my friends to go, too. last week we saw "borat" and loved it, but this is honest to goodness ten times better. for anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance, see this film. these guys' talent is so great you should have no hesitation supporting their cause. you will not be disappointed, and the rock lords will smile upon you favorably.

i saw this movie on a fluke.i was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie.i gave it a chance not expecting much.the promotional movie posters i've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all.the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.i'll leave it there.the movie is a heavy comedy and lot's of fun.if your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film.jack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician.tenacious d is definitely worth a look!

just saw it at as closing film of austin film festival. going in, a had seen a few snippets of their act at alamo drafthouse, and thought the trailer was amusing but i wasn't expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. watch out for cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins, and the dark lord himself (who has a fetish for kg). so much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. the car chase was by far my favorite scene. i know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new tenacious d fans, just like me. i hope this does well in the theaters. "follow me, we are the shadows"

the greatest movie ever.how's that for a contention? however, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that three colours red is a masterpiece. it is not enough to merely say this - three colours red is the masterpiece of world cinema. if you accept that citizen kane is not human enough, if you accept that star wars is not actually very good, if you accept that ozu and mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then three colours red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. as a discussion into human morality, three colours red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that none can match. blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. white forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was better still, but still not quite there. red, however, is the real thing. what he expresses in this movie, is an expression of what it is to be human. in fact, what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human. it forces us to examine up to the minutest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. in red, one may find meaning on one of its several levels. on the first level, red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling red an exceptionally entertaining story. however, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie. it is as if kieslowski is saying: "ceci n'est pas la réalité". in effect, in pursuing a humanistic goal, kieslowski can also challenge reality. it is a trick that kieslowski has been attempting since le double vie de véronique, but not until this, his final film, did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate, philosophy and circumstance. the actors and actresses, too, appear to be at the mercy of a greater power. valentine (irène jacob), is aptly name, for she seems to represent an almost pure love. meanwhile, the idea of first impressions is challenged by jean-louis tritignant's judge kern, a cantankerous man, who, by the end, becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy, a power which he could only achieve through valentine.we have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. in fact, films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. it won't happen, of course, but at least we have the power to view this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define, but all possess. a synopsis of this film read: "a film about a woman who runs over a dog". well, it is.isn't it?-simon huxtable

this is a classic continuation to bleu, the likewise excellent film, with juliet binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in rouge, just for a second at the very end. but this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. the main heroine, played by ever great irene jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. she leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend mike, who is in england. by some lucky chance, she gets friendly with the old judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. the story starts to weave even further, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his pastime. she is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute doggy rita and her pups, and for all the people who surround them. we also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... but the film is not about this, even. it is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people, far and near. when she sails to england on a ferry, with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger, as well as that earlier mentioned binoche who starred in bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. she did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. mr. kislowski managed to draw a grand, subtle story about the solitude, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. brilliant film.

one of the better musical bios. dennis morgan is great as the singer/composer chauncey olcutt. the supporting cast is very good, especially andrea king as the glamorous lillian russell. the turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting. the technicolor is excellent. a simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer.

this is truly a kung fu classic. this film appears to have influenced martial arts films for decades. the spanish guitar background music, the competing schools, the impossibly high leaps onto the edges of rooftops, catching thrown spears, cheating in tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and perseverance, and more were copied by many later films such as "the karate kid" (1984), "hero" (2002), "kill bill volume 2" (2004), and "kung fu hustle" (2004).i feel lucky to have first seen this film in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before kung fu films became mainstream and before bruce lee became a household name. i saw it with two buddies of mine in a downtown san diego theater frequented by sailors, and although the scenes of the glowing red hands and gouged eyeballs got some laughs, clearly the audience was getting into it, as was our little group. it was a very memorable movie for me. decades later i could still recall several specific scenes, even after i had forgotten the film title. this film is extra special to me now because one of those two buddies with whom i first saw it (sailor kenneth lee hines of the kitty hawk) has since passed away, so this film serves as a memento of that day together before we took judo and karate lessons in subsequent years.relative to kung fu films, i'd rate this film as 10/10. but since i have to keep the larger film audience in mind, i'll more objectively rate it as 8/10, due to obvious technical flaws. i just recommend that neophyte viewers consider those technical flaws to be proof of its vintage nature and of its authenticity, and then merrily proceed to enjoy its testosterone-charged mayhem.

"five fingers of death" started the american kung-fu movie craze but i remember seeing it for the first time as "king boxer" in chinatown, nyc, without the bad dubbing and few americans. i also was fortunate enough to see the american premiere of "five fingers of death" on times square, nyc. what a contrast this turned out to be...same film but different audiences.in chinatown, this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers. it was because of hearing the real voices of the actors(in chinese) that made this movie more believable. chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years(1972's "boxer from shantung" beat them all in gore), so the action choreography & story were the main attraction. rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh. every great kung fu film had wonderful, dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and ffod had them too. the star, lieh lo, was a known actor in chinese theaters. the mostly chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. the audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me.on times square, this film was an action comedy...probably unintentionally. i enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. the crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. from the start, the movie made you laugh. as soon as the audience heard those strange british accents come from those chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon. most american audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. the action sequences blew the audience away. unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that, bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.i had fun seeing this movie with an american audience but enjoyed it much more in chinatown. some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of ffod can't. the original "king boxer" is still enjoyable...a classic!

the patriot is a well thought out, well produced film, that will draw the viewer into the story directly, and keep them involved to the very end. granted, it is not in the same vein as under siege, et. al., but this is definitely the trademark film of what might be described as seagal's second era of films. not so much action movies with a nod to a story thrown in for good measure, but a good story, matched with a point, and injected with some of seagal's unimitable action sequences. is this the kind of film that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? probably not. but for those of us who not only like our action, but also can appreciate a well told story, this is a big step forward for seagal. it's almost like the transformation clint eastwood made as he tried to step out from underneath the shadow of his "dirty harry" series. either man, had he continued in the singular direction they were headed, would have forever been keyholed in in specific role and guaranteed the brevity of their careers...

i really enjoyed the patriot. this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. one line in the movie from wesley mclaren (seagal) stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society, "western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and i am in the business of curing it."

it seems that all people didn't like steven seagal: just take a look at his nomination list, there are only razzie awards nominations (with one win) for him, but i think he didn't earn anything of it. i saw good movies with steven seagal, i saw bad movies with steven seagal. and the patriot (1998) is one of his best movies, nearly as good as under siege (1992) or hard to kill (1990). the patriot shows his activities to protect nature. surely, this movie is not a great one, and i must say that there is more violence than i like, and why must seagal's best friend l. q. jones die the death of a victim? the role of dr. mcclaren is one of seagal's best performances. he has, as always, a very good charisma. and in summary, the patriot is good entertainment-and with an average rating of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time.regards, hans-dieter

man, i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. everyone thinks they're a critic. they comment on things that the average movie goer doesn't even know or think about.i enjoyed the film. it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed. steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that's also a reason to watch. what's even more funny is the people that complain about his films, say he's the worst and that we shouldn't watch his films, yet watch his movies anyway. all so they can comment on how bad they are. who's the dummy? if you don't like his work, don't watch it. then you won't have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event.stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again.

basically, this is a very good film. it is very different from seagal's other films though, which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans. unlike some of the other films, this does not feel like a 'seagal vehicle'. you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr. seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before. the concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change. although there are some unrealistic parts to the film (some more obvious than others), in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch.it boils down to this: if you are looking for a classic seagal action film, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. watch it anyway for the fun of it. if you're open to seeing seagal without the action, it's well worth a look. i personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while.

many people are making fun out of steven seagals acting abilities. and i really see why if i remember fire down below. well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). after reading reviews about the patriot i didn't expect anything from this film. i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the patriot was even worse. so i was really surprised about this one. in my opinion it is one of his very best movies. if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best. i liked the story the directing and the actors. cammilla belle was just incredible. she will have a great movie-career in the future. the few action scenes were very well made. and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role.
